<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;During the winter recess, in my capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I attended the Fifth Australasian and Pacific Conference on Delegated Legislation. This conference is held biennially and its venue is shared amongst the participating jurisdictions. This year it was held in Darwin on 5 to 7 July. I was accompanied by Senator Jacinta Collins, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan AM, the committee's legal adviser, and members of the committee's secretariat. Senator Minchin was to attend, but was prevented from doing so by the sudden onset of appendicitis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I express my appreciation to the hosts of the conference. In particular, I thank Mr Rick Setter MLA, chair of the Northern Territory parliament's Subordinate Legislation and Tabled Papers Committee, and the secretary of that committee, Mrs Helen Allmich, who is also Serjeant-at-Arms of the Northern Territory parliament. Their hospitality set the atmosphere for a successful conference. I am certain that I also speak on behalf of Senator Jacinta Collins and committee staff when I congratulate Mr Rick Setter and Mrs Allmich on their hard work in organising the event. It was apparent from the comments of other participants at the conference that these two convenors' generosity of spirit had been extended to each and every person who attended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference was officially opened by His Honour the Administrator of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Austin Asche AC, QC, who spoke on the importance of properly drafted delegated legislation and the role of delegated legislation. His Honour stated that `delegated legislation is the what, why, when, how, where and who of legislation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the conference is to bring together the committees, organisations and individuals involved in the scrutiny of legislation throughout jurisdictions in Australasia. This year, the conference was attended by about 70 delegates from the Commonwealth, states and territories. Delegates from New Zealand also attended. It was unfortunate that representatives from the Hong Kong parliament had to cancel at the last moment. I look forward to their attendance at the next conference. Understandably, delegates from the Queensland committee had to withdraw due to the state election campaign, but they were ably represented by the committee staff members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference serves as an ideal forum for committee members and staff to exchange information and expertise. Papers are formally presented on matters of interest or on scrutiny issues requiring special attention. The papers presented at this year's conference were of high quality and, with the concurrence of the Senate, I propose to seek leave to table the bound volume containing those papers when they become available. I will mention the papers' contents briefly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hon. Bruce Donaldson MLC, Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation in Western Australia, presented a paper entitled `Subordinate legislation in Western Australia: investigation and proposals for reform'. The general theme of the paper was to summarise the observations of the committee in relation to the scrutiny procedures in certain foreign jurisdictions. The committee had visited Washington, London and Paris in a bid to acquire `a better understanding of the nature of subordinate legislation and systems of scrutiny'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Richard Northey, the Chairman of the New Zealand Regulations Review Committee, presented an informative discourse on the apparent increase in use of Henry VIII provisions in New Zealand subordinate legislation. He suggested the increase is attributable to the complex reforms of the past decade. He concluded with a statement of commitment to vigilance in scrutinising Henry VIII clauses in relation to transitional provisions and to require officials to appear before the committee to justify the need for such provisions in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hon. Robert Lawson QC, MLC, Chairman of the Legislative Review Committee in South Australia, spoke about a code of conduct for members of parliament. He prefaced his paper with humorous comments about the perceived level of trustworthiness of politicians. The results of a survey he referred to claimed that politicians ranked second last in the public's perception as to the trustworthiness of various professions. Politicians, he told the conference, came in just ahead of ministers. In a light vein, he queried, if the survey's findings were valid, why so many members of parliament aspired to become ministers. Mr Lawson proceeded to deliver an overview of recent proposals in relation to codes of conduct for members of parliament and to examine some of the arguments for and against the introduction of such codes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other papers relevant to the scrutiny of delegated legislation were presented by or on behalf of the Victorian, Queensland and New  South Wales committees. Mr Murray Thompson MP from the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee in Victoria presented a paper, the philosophical considerations of which were reflected in the title, `Introducing the new act: the more things change, the more they stay the same'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Jill Hall MLA, the Chair of the Regulations Review Committee in New South Wales, had prepared a paper entitled `New regulatory reform horizons for New South Wales&mdash;but some problems still remain'. It was extremely unfortunate that Ms Hall suffered from severe laryngitis for the whole of the conference&mdash;a most disturbing affliction for a member of parliament. Her paper was presented by Mr Bob Harrison, also an MLA from New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of the ebullient Mr Jon Sullivan, the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation in Queensland, Ms Louisa Pink, that committee's research director, outlined developments in relation to the legislation making and scrutiny process in the post-Fitzgerald era. Brian Davison, an MHA from Tasmania and a member of the Tasmanian parliament's Standing Committee on Subordinate Legislation, presented a report summarising that state's regulatory review program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I presented a paper on legislation by incorporation. This involved an examination of section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. The paper focused on the history of the section, its relevance to scrutiny and its role in safeguarding democratic rights and freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other papers presented were of more relevance to the scrutiny of primary legislation. Mr Victor Perton MP, Chairman of the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee in Victoria, argued the case against `no compensation' clauses. Mr Perton made other considerable contributions to the conference, including formal replies to two of the papers presented by other members of the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two papers were presented by senators who are members of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Senator Troeth, the chair of that committee, whose paper was provocatively entitled `Don't come the raw prawn', expounded the efforts of the committee to uncover `attempts by executive governments to encroach on the legislative function of parliaments'. Senator Ellison presented a well-prepared and thought provoking examination of the abrogation of privilege against self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other matters were formally raised at the conference. Mr David Kinley, a senior lecturer in law at the Australian National University, addressed the conference in relation to a perceived need for increased vigilance towards the scrutiny of legislation for matters affecting human rights. Mr Rick Setter MLA discussed the passage of the legislation which made history recently in the Northern Territory&mdash;namely, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. This paper was confined to a discussion of the parliamentary procedures which guided the passage of the bill and did not in any way attempt to debate the subject matter of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Dennis Pearce and Mr Stephen Argument informed the conference of their intention to produce a second edition of Professor Pearce's book, the well-known and respected text, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Delegated legislation in Australia and New Zealand</EMPHASIS>. Ms Jean Baker of the Office of Legislative Drafting of the Attorney-General's Department addressed the conference in relation to the provisions of the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, which, hopefully, will one day be before the Senate for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference also marked the official launching of a discussion paper entitled `The scrutiny of national scheme legislation and the desirability of uniform scrutiny principles'. This paper was prepared by a working party comprised of the chairs of all scrutiny committees in Australia. The paper promotes informed discussion and invites comments from interested persons and organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its conclusion, the conference resolved to congratulate Professor Pearce and Mr Stephen Argument for their proposed revision of the text on delegated legislation. It also formally resolved to note matters which had been discussed, and recorded that the discussion had been beneficial and of great value to the participants at the conference. The next conference is scheduled to be held two years hence in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot conclude this report without giving special mention to the guest speaker at the formal dinner, Her Honour Justice Sally Thomas of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. Justice Thomas recounted some of her experiences in hearing evidence given by Aboriginals and explained some of the difficulties confronting Aboriginals in participating in the judicial system in terms of cultural differences. She concluded her inspiring speech with an entertaining poem she had composed about legislation and the place of scrutiny in the democratic process. The poem reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I speak tonight of legislation, subordinate and delegated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliament may legislate, prorogate and delegate,</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an age of legislative proliferation and complex regulations,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I last spoke on this matter in the Senate, I raised the concern that had been expressed in relation to the definition of a small company as opposed to the definition of a large company. The government, which has been critical of the coalition in relation to the delay in this bill, has really found that there was cause for delay, because during the non-sitting period concern was expressed by people such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Motor Trades Association on this very aspect of the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are not saying that the bill itself is flawed or bad. They are just saying that there is one aspect which needs to be looked at, namely, the ramifications which will flow from that arbitrary definition. So that in hindsight the delay was indeed worth while and, if it serves the purpose of having a definition which is more properly defined, then small business will only benefit from this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the business community that they need to look at this aspect of the bill and that the feedback we get from the community is essential&mdash;as legislators we have to rely on what the community tells us. If the business community says that this will have practical problems, then we have to be alive to those problems. I believe that the reference of this aspect to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee is worth while and will serve the interests of the wider community in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did mention that there are positive aspects of the bill. On behalf of the coalition, I welcome the use of plain English in the drafting of this bill and I also welcome the somewhat different layout of the bill. These innovative aspects make it easier for the average person to pick up such a piece of legislation and understand it. Although this is a rather complex area of the law, one would expect that, even if one drafted it in the simplest terms, one might still have problems with the ins and outs of it. Nonetheless, the use of plain English is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of the bill are also welcomed. The permitted share buyback amendments allow a company to purchase its own shares and modify the rules on buybacks. In the past it has been considered that a purchase by a company of its own shares was undesirable. In this bill it is now considered that permitted buybacks allow a company which is in a good financial state to take advantage of market conditions and repurchase its shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it will be necessary to keep an eye on this aspect of the bill. However, it is an amendment which is quite welcome and I support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment relates to the formation of a proprietary company and allows for a company to be formed by one person. The current provisions allow at least two people to act as directors. We can have a situation where a person involved in a business ropes in his or her spouse or partner to be a silent director. That is quite artificial. This amendment is a good one; it is commonsense and it will make things easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also applaud the small business guide which will be incorporated in the bill and which is well overdue. It summarises the main provisions of the law. A lot of people in the small business sector have a good many laws, acts of parliament and regulations to deal with and anything which can make their understanding more simple can only be welcome. I believe the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities has recommended the inclusion of this guide and, furthermore, that there be some review of it after it has been in operation for a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, I think the bill simplifies the various regulatory and reporting provisions which touch on small companies. The coalition supports this bill, save for the aspect of the definition of small and large companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was due for debate in the last session of parliament, and in fact it came on during the last day of the parliament. There has been some criticism that the bill was not dealt with at that time. However, as I recall it, there was a censure motion of Senator Bolkus, the Minister representing the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), on foot relating to the tabling of documents by Senator Bolkus and that censure motion occupied the debate on that day. That was the reason for the delay in the first instance. Nonetheless, in hindsight, the delay has benefited small business and will only improve the bill when the legal and constitutional affairs committee has a look at the definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the small business community that another couple of weeks will be of benefit to them because, after all, it is our duty as legislators to get the legislation right, not to just rush bills through for the sake of having them rushed through. Our task is primarily to get the legislation right and ensure that the flow-on effects do not have unintended consequences. I believe that the definition of a large company could well catch many businesses and thereby cause them to have to comply with these onerous reporting conditions. As the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry pointed out, that could well involve an extra $25,000 per year in auditing costs. </PARA>

There are many aspects of the bill with which the National and Liberal parties agree and entirely support. But there is one aspect of the bill that has sounded alarm bells right through the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely fortuitous that there was a censure motion on the last day of sitting that prevented this bill coming before the parliament and being voted on. The bill as it stands would have terrible implications for many of Australia's small business people. I can understand where the government is coming from, but they are wrong. You cannot prevent people doing business with each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is trying to remove the possibility of creditors losing money when a company goes bankrupt. If you put those restrictions on business what happens is that businesses will never be able to trade. The bill would require, and this is the part of the bill that the National and Liberal parties are concerned about, a great many small businesses&mdash;and I do not know how many, but I suspect about 100,000 small businesses&mdash;to use auditing processes which would cost them between $25,000 and $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many small businesses out there at the moment who have survived the holocaust of the Keating high interest rates and the depression and for those who are just hanging on, any extra costs could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. The National and Liberal parties are totally opposed to this issue and will not, if possible, add to the cost of small business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has said, in trying to strike a definition, is that if the consolidated gross operating revenue for the financial year of a company and its entities exceeds $10 million then it is deemed to be a big company. If the consolidated gross assets at the end of the financial year of the company and its entities exceed $5 million then it is deemed to be a big company. If the company and its entities at the end of the financial year employ more than 50 people then it is deemed to be a big company. If a company satisfies two of the three criteria then it is required to have an audit done by a professional auditing firm which could cost between $9,000 and $20,000. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Motor Trades Association of Australia and the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry believe that this could cost anywhere between $25,000 and $40,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 800,000 to 900,000 small businesses in Australia. Some 45 per cent of those are corporatised companies or proprietary limited companies. If 45 per cent of the 800,000 to 900,000 companies are corporatised many of them would fall into the big category. I have had representations from a representative of one firm in Townsville. He took this legislation to his accountant. At present this firm is paying $9,000 a year in auditing fees. He was told by his accountant that it would cost $32,000 to comply with this legislation. They were the accountant's official figures. That person runs a very successful business and, I suppose, he can afford that. It would hurt and damage him, but I think he could get through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other companies that just could not afford that extra $30,000 to keep them in the game. I have a statement here from someone who owns an engineering firm in Western Australia. He says that he has taken this piece of legislation to his accountants who have informed him that the cost would be an additional $50,000. So as far as this bill being helpful to Australia's small business is concerned, it is really putting a lot of weight in their saddle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very grateful to Senator Vanstone for giving this particular piece of legislation the opportunity to go to a Senate inquiry. It is now up to all the people who are going to be affected by this legislation to make submissions. As my colleague Senator Ellison said a few minutes ago, we are the people who are elected to examine legislation but we must get feedback from the constituents who are worried about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the feedback on this bill came in very late in the piece&mdash;about last week sometime. We had to scramble to try to unwind the mess that the government had put through. I do not know where Senator Schacht stands on this legislation but his department was absolutely lacking when it scrutinised the legislation on how it affects small business. Senator Schacht comes in here and tells us that he is the minister for small business and that he is their voice, but for him to allow this piece of legislation to go through cabinet shows that he has not been looking for anything in this legislation that would disadvantage small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the legislation was put out to help small business. In many ways it does. The small business community, along with COSBOA's Rob Bastian and many other people, has been seeking this simplification process with the government. Unfortunately, this legislation nearly got through. It escaped getting through only due to the vigilance of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Motor Trades Association of Queensland and one or two other organisations. It was a very close call for small business, and is one now that I think we can get to a Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government can see the error of their ways&mdash;which I believe they will when it is presented to them by accountants who will be asked to make submissions&mdash;and they are told of the consequences this legislation will impose on small business, I am very hopeful that they will amend the bill. If they do not, I feel quite confident that the National and Liberal parties will move an amendment. I am sure the Democrats and the Greens would support it. I can see no reason why any person who thinks or is remotely concerned about small business would inflict that additional cost of $25,000 on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the thrust of opposition has come from the Motor Trades Association, and that will affect many of the car dealers in Australia. If you think about it, a $10 million turnover is not a very high turnover in today's terms. Employment of 50 people is not huge. Many companies would have assets of $5 million. It will affect not only the motor traders but also many small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking to one of my Senate colleagues last night, and we picked on a small town in Queensland. Together we could identify around five small businesses in a small sugar town of about 5,000 people that would be affected by this legislation. The owners or proprietors of those businesses would fall into the big category and would have to pay an additional $20,000 to $25,000 accountancy costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President West, I know that you are a representative of rural New South Wales. You know the desperate plight of many small businesses in rural Australia at the moment. You would know that, because of the drought, low commodity prices and because many small businesses have given credit out, they are in desperate stages themselves. If this bill were to go through in its present form, it would affect not only car dealers but also hardware dealers. Many hardware dealers have over 50 people and inventories of over $10 million and $5 million in assets. They are not huge companies, just family companies that have been there for many years, that have supported the towns, that have played their part in the small business of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would also be many hotels that would fall into that category. A huge number of builders would fall into the category and would then have to pay an extra $20,000 to $25,000 accountancy fees. Small business has been indeed fortunate that this bill was delayed on the last day of the last session of parliament and that we have just headed this disaster off at the pass. Small business can breathe again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think it is a bit over the top when the Attorney-General's Department puts out a press release accusing the arrogant Liberals of holding legislation hostage when they are telling the business community, `Don't negotiate with the opposition. We'll look after you. Don't talk to the opposition. Don't do anything with the opposition. They can't help you. This is a matter of privacy between you and us.' While they were trying to stab small business in the back, they were putting out press releases accusing us of holding up the legislation. That is totally irresponsible of the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch. It shows his total and utter contempt for small business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It absolutely disappoints me that the Attorney-General's Department could hold the gun at small business's head and say `Don't go and talk to the opposition.' For goodness sake, we live in a democracy. This is not Russia. Fancy having an Attorney-General that is supposed to support the freedom of all Australians telling a certain group of business people, `Don't talk to the opposition or the Democrats, we'll look after you,' when they had no intention whatsoever of looking after small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business will not be disappointed in the government. They know that the government is their enemy. They know that the ALP has no understanding or comprehension of small business at all. They will just say, `We wouldn't have expected anything more from the ALP.' I will leave my presentation at that, because I believe many other people want to address this bill. In closing, I want to say that it is a joke for the ALP and the government to tell the small business associations&mdash;not such small businesses, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which represents big business too&mdash;`Don't go and talk to the opposition or anyone else.' It is an absolute dereliction of the Attorney-General's duty as the chief law officer in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many good things about this legislation, particularly the simplification elements&mdash;and I am particularly talking about exempt proprietary companies. There are many exempt proprietary companies that have been for years unnecessarily burdened by the enormous costs of compliance with the Corporations Law. There is no doubt that one of the most offensive and intrusive roles of government is to impose enormous costs of compliance on the private sector, particularly on small businesses struggling to survive in a very competitive economic environment, an economic environment in which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is happy to say, `This is as good as it gets,' as they struggle to survive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs of compliance in many instances and across many areas of federal legislation are ludicrously and unnecessarily high. I have to say that I commend the government for responding to a parliamentary committee's request that corporation&mdash;particularly exempt proprietary company&mdash;reporting be addressed properly. The great bulk of exempt proprietary companies exist not for the purpose of heavy trading with the public but for private purposes and are not involved in exposing members of the public to risk in doing business with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many family companies that are there for the convenience basically of the family, so that people have an equal or an adjudged share, depending on their shareholding, in the assets of the family. It is absurd that these people have been required to meet some of the quite significant requirements of the Corporations Law. I must say that I have sympathised with that expenditure and with the unnecessary effort that has had to be put in, particularly in providing key financial data or an audited report, depending on the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, there is no doubt that many companies have abused the system. They have been able to abuse the system because the Australian Securities Commission has been inundated with annual returns from the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that are incorporated in Australia, from exempt proprietary companies, to the extent that the ASC has admitted repeatedly at Senate estimates hearings that it does not have the capacity, let alone the desire I think, to examine the accuracy&mdash;even on a spot check basis, the way the Taxation Commissioner does&mdash;of returns put in to the Australian Securities Commission by exempt proprietary companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason the Prime Minister's piggery group, for example, kept putting in false and misleading annual returns, saying wrongly that they had earned profits when they had suffered losses and saying they had a surplus on shareholders' funds when they had deficits. It is because of this that the Prime Minister's piggery was able to get away with deceiving the Australian public for years about the true nature of how much the piggery was losing, curiously enough at a time when the Prime Minister managed to hold on for three years while the piggery lost millions of dollars; and then he sold out, at a profit, to foreigners. He hid that by using some devices, by selling it through his partner, so he would not have to be seen to be in a potential conflict of interest requiring Foreign Investment Review Board approval. The whole thing is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time this Prime Minister did get up and acknowledge that his whole piggery venture was shrouded in breaches of the law; in fact, in breaches of five sets of laws. He has never at any stage distanced himself from those breaches. He has never said, `Look, I am sorry about this. I am sorry that my partner has been criticised by the Danish partners in this venture for having brought them into disrepute into Australia. I am sorry about that. I regret that these things happened.' Not on your life; he is too arrogant to regret anything. One of the reasons&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Far be it from me to try to do something about Senator Michael Baume's single-minded obsession, but we are, in fact, debating the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill. I think it would be a reasonable action on your part to draw that to Senator Baume's attention and ask him to address the substance of the bill that is before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the point of order: the point I was making was that there is no capacity to check the accuracy and the breaches of the law by the Prime Minister's piggery group because the Australian Securities Commission has been inundated with requirements that are now being changed. It is specifically relevant to the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator McGauran)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;There is always a fine line in these matters between relevancy and irrelevancy. Usually in these debates, particularly on seemingly uncontroversial legislation, you are entitled to stray rather far, but I would ask Senator Baume not to stray too far and wide. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I have no intention of straying too far; I am just concentrating on this particular snout in this particular trough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, the inundation of the Australian Securities Commission with annual returns&mdash;most of which are unnecessary and which impose a ludicrous burden on the Securities Commission&mdash;has prevented the Securities Commission from properly examining the fraudulent activity of so many companies which deliberately put in false annual returns. Because the Securities Commission under this proposed change is going to get rid of that burden of having to require key financial data and so on coming in, it will at last have the opportunity&mdash;and I encourage the ASC to use that opportunity&mdash;to direct its attention to checking those returns that come in, perhaps on a spot check basis. This would ensure that the sort of misreporting, deception and fraudulent activity, such as took place in the Prime Minister's piggery group in the matter of their false reports to the ASC, can be properly checked in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will not then depend on a member of parliament going in and searching through the matters on the public record to establish just how false and inaccurate the returns have been and, for example, how they were in breach of the Securities Commission's own recommendations by failing at one stage to put in the appropriate audited returns. Those audited returns demonstrated that the previous returns put in by the Prime Minister's piggery group partner, Mr Constantinidis, were false. That is why that is so relevant. These changes will stop people like Mr Constantinidis, acting on behalf of Mr Keating as his half owner in the piggery group, putting in false returns with impunity. The ASC will now be able to focus on these matters, instead of being inundated with a whole lot of unnecessary annual returns, because of this legislation getting rid of that burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are, nonetheless, some problems. While I commend the government for reducing the cost of compliance for a whole range of proprietary companies, I still say there are offensive and enormous costs of compliance over a whole range of other governmental activities. For instance, the taxation legislation involves compliance costs which are absurd and a disgrace to small business. A survey of accountants revealed recently that the cost of collecting sales tax, for example, by small business is on average some 25 per cent of the sales tax actually collected. But the taxation commissioner does not carry that cost; small business does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alleged simplifications have taken place in the past&mdash;the tax legislation, for example. I can remember this government saying it was going to simplify the tax act. When it came to government the tax act was 1,100 pages long. It has been `simplified' into 3,347 pages. The costs of compliance to business are absolutely absurd. I have some concerns. While this legislation is going to make it certainly much cheaper and much more reasonable for small proprietary companies, particularly family companies, to meet their reporting obligations, there is a cut-off level. That cut-off level causes me some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, large proprietary companies will have to put in detailed audited returns. There is some merit in that. The question is: at what level do you become a large company? According to the act, large proprietary companies are those which meet at least two of the following criteria: their gross operating revenue must be $10 million a year or more, their assets must be $5 million or more and the number of employees 50 or more. There is one crucial error in that trilogy&mdash;the word `assets'. That is so irrelevant. I simply cannot understand how it can have got through parliamentary committees and the appropriate authorities and the government&mdash;although the government has been there so long it probably does not have the capacity to examine legislation properly anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The word `assets' is totally irrelevant. The correct word, the word of relevance, particularly to people who do business with companies, is `liabilities', the external liabilities. That should be the judgment. Assets fail on almost every ground when you look at them as the criteria. Assets can be `revalued'. Assets are subject to subjective valuation. The piggery company's assets got trebled in size by a revaluation, not assisted by any registered valuers. Paul Keating's piggery company suddenly got revalued upwards, despite the fact that it was deteriorating. Unfortunately pigs' urine does have some kind of an impact on buildings. They increased the value of the buildings&mdash;not the land, not the property&mdash;in a ludicrous, nonsensical dressing up of the accounts to try to make them look more presentable. Yet here we have the government having assets, which are subject, as I said, to subjective fiddling, being the criteria. What we will see here are assets being fiddled down. A building bought 30 years ago may well appear in these accounts at cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You might have the view that that is a good way of understating your assets. This sort of incompetence does not impress me, particularly when we look at the concerns of people doing business with a corporation, with a group. What they want to know is the liabilities. You cannot fiddle your liabilities. Liabilities are liabilities&mdash;what you owe. You cannot revalue them. Sure, you can make provisions against them. I cannot see how you can fiddle your liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is particularly relevant is that if you have liabilities as the criteria, say $5 million worth of liabilities, you should then say `external liabilities'. If the liabilities are owed to the owner of the company, then the owner of the company is at risk. That happens in many instances for a whole lot of reasons. Or it may be liability to a group&mdash;for example, a motor dealer whose liabilities are to the motor company to which he is franchised. If those liabilities were excluded&mdash;in other words, they are in-house liabilities&mdash;then we would not have the sort of problem that Senator Boswell and Senator Macdonald, certainly in discussions with me, have raised about motor distributors, for example, in small Queensland towns suddenly being held to be major proprietary companies and caught under the quite proper and significant reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress: it is so easy to fix this mess. All you have to do is make it `external liabilities'. As I said, why the government has not done that, I presume, can only be because of the massive lack of commercial experience by people in government who are making laws about how to run businesses and who have never been exposed to the reality of business themselves. I hope that it is not too late in the process. Certainly, I hope there will be a Senate committee meeting, presumably on Friday, about this simple change which will properly exclude, hopefully, those people who should be excluded from this process and who are unintended consequences, if you like, of this kind of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stress: there is a very sound case indeed for requiring larger companies to come clean. I think the ASC estimates that about only two per cent of exempt proprietary companies would be required to meet these new commitments. There is a very good case for that to happen. Let us recognise this: giving people limited liability by allowing them to incorporate their businesses should bring with it appropriate and offsetting accountability. So it is not good enough to say, `I've got a company. I don't have to reveal anything. I don't have to report properly. I don't have to do all the things that should be offsetting, if you like, the great benefit I have got of limited liability.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real and great need for accountably in Australia, particularly judging by some of the disgraceful behaviour of some builders, for example, to their subcontractors. In so many instances in Australia, buildings have been put up at the cost of subcontractors who have to carry the can when the builder goes broke. We have had too many examples of this sort of thing to fail to recognise that there is a clear need for accountability when you have limited liability. But the big question is: how accountable should you be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find difficult is that there is, in this legislation, an inadequate description of what makes up a group of companies that would enable it to be classified as big. We have seen the criteria, which I said should be changed from assets of $5 million to liabilities of $5 million, with gross operating revenues of $10 million; liabilities, let us hope, of $5 million; and the number of employees at 50. What is to stop a dishonest group splitting itself up so that it escapes this criteria? The legislation says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the consolidated gross operating revenue for the financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is $10 million or more.</PARA>
<PARA>It says `the entities it controls'. There is no definition here about control&mdash;at least I could not see one in the legislation. It would seem to me that there is a real risk. If a person as an owner of a company were to directly own as well company B in which company A, the one he owned, has an interest, who actually owns that ultimate company? Is it the original owner? Is it the company he owns?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big question is that there appear to me to be loopholes through which dishonest people could fiddle this arrangement to diminish the appearance of ownership. It says `the company'; it does not say `a person who controls'. In clause 3, on page 46 of the bill, it says `large proprietary company'. What concerns me is that this is a loophole that should be closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because once again we can learn from experience. We can look at the Keating piggery group. They hived off a company in order to avoid the industrial relations law. They hived off a company so they would not have more than 16 employees. It was a member of the group, but they changed the ownership so that it appeared to be held by another member of that group. I might say that, as a result, they underpaid three workers&mdash;and this was while Mr Keating was a half owner, of course, but you expect that from a Labor leader, cheating his workers&mdash;and then pretended they were not the real employer at all, hiding the name of the real employer when action was taken against them. So we have seen from the experience of the Keating companies that this kind of legislation can be got around if someone has a mind to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final concern is that existing companies which appear to be of note do not need to meet these new requirements. For example, the Keating piggery group&mdash;allegedly no longer held by him, although there is a curious option to repurchase&mdash;can escape these requirements if they choose to stick by the old rules; in other words, if it has its accounts audited and decides not to be in it. Why is there this escape hatch? Why does this need to be grandfathered? There is a real need for improvement in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you read the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), you could not help but agree with the proposals that are put forward. In relation to proprietary companies the explanatory memorandum mentions that single director companies will now be allowed, and I think that is a worthwhile amendment. The memorandum says that a comprehensive guide for small business will be included. I have had a look at that, and I think that is very worthwhile. Before coming to parliament I did a little bit of legal work advising small companies in a small country town, and I think that will be very useful for people who use a company set-up to operate their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum goes on to say there will be reduced accounting and financial reporting. What a great innovation that will be for small business people. The annual general meeting becomes optional. I might say, without giving away any secrets, that those things were more done in name than in actual form in the past, so I think the legislation has eventually caught up with practice. That in itself is a good innovation. The explanatory memorandum also goes on to say that small proprietary companies will not have to prepare annual accounts unless required to do so by the ACS. For most proprietary companies, or for what were previously exempt proprietary companies, that is also appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on the face of it, this legislation&mdash;which has the aim of achieving significant simplification of the text of the law, simplifying the substance of the rules and eliminating unnecessary and redundant legislation&mdash;is a good one. Certainly on that basis the Liberal and National parties support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, due to the Labor Party's own mismanagement and failures, this bill was not brought before the chamber prior to the Senate rising at the end of June. The Attorney-General, quite wrongly and mischievously, accused the opposition of holding up this bill and, in doing so, said that small business people would be shattered as a result of our action. First of all, it was not true that it was our action; it was due to the government's own incompetence. Secondly, in hindsight, it is particularly fortunate that the bill was not rushed through and that the Senate exercised its normal right to scrutinise these things in depth because it has transpired that the bill is not all that it seems to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues who have spoken before me have highlighted the principal concern that has been exposed in the last parliamentary break. The thing that concerns me and others on this side, but would come as no shock to those trying to deal with this Labor Party government, is that a group of people who have an interest in this bill, a small business representative group, approached the government with an argument about what needed looking at. I am told&mdash;and some of my colleagues have related this experience as well&mdash;by some of those people involved that these groups went before the government and its advisers and were told that the argument seemed to be a good one. They were told by almost a wink and a nod that their concerns would be looked after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these groups said, `If you are going to look at these, perhaps the Liberal and National parties and the minor parties should also be advised and we should circulate our material to them,' the advisers and government representatives said, `Don't do that. Don't tell them about it. We'll fix it up. We'll look after it. Don't you worry about that.' The wink and the nod was given that it would all be okay. It then transpires that nothing happened. These people relaxed because they understood that the government was going to address these concerns. Nothing happened and, as a result, it was only in recent times that the Liberal and National parties became aware of these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not intend to speak on this bill. I thought it was a pretty simple matter. It was one that I supported, so I had not listed myself to speak. But several business people from North Queensland&mdash;in fact, a couple from my own home town of Ayr&mdash;raised this matter with me. For the government's and advisers' consideration, they say that not many companies and small businesses are going to be affected by this legislation, particularly the distinction between small and large proprietary companies. But in my own home town of Ayr, which is a prosperous and, we think, quite large country town&mdash;about 20,000 people in the district&mdash;without even contacting anyone, I know from my experience in a legal practice in that area that there would be three family companies at least&mdash;and, as I say, I know this from my own knowledge without doing any research, without talking to anyone&mdash;who are now caught by this definition and will now become large proprietary companies rather than exempt proprietary companies as they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told by those people that the additional cost to them of having things audited will be in the range of $10,000 to $30,000, and I see some other press reports saying $30,000 to $80,000. But many of these companies&mdash;not the ones I talk about, but small businesses who operate through companies&mdash;would not have operating profits of $30,000 a year. Yet this government wants those people to spend, in many instances, more than their total annual profit in going through these requirements. Perhaps I am being a bit harsh. Perhaps it is an unintended consequence that the government was not aware of. But I know the government was aware of it because these groups tried to talk to it and its advisers. They were given the wink and the nod and then completely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is as good as it gets, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has told small business, then a lot of these small business people that I know are in real trouble. This sort of insensitivity comes from a government which has no understanding or appreciation of small business, a government which is comprised of ministers, a vast majority of whom have never worked in private enterprise and who have always had the cheque coming in at the end of the week or the end of the month. People who have worked for the Labor Party, people who have worked for the union movement&mdash;and that is the majority of ministers&mdash;people in the Public Service or academia, people who have always had a regular income, simply cannot appreciate what it is like to be in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of legislation just makes it so much more difficult for small business to continue operating. We have  an unemployment problem in Australia because small business, which is still the greatest employer of people, is simply scared stiff about doing anything while this government remains in control doing this sort of thing. There are lots of other reasons why they are concerned about this government's actions, but this piece of legislation is just one example of why small business is so petrified of doing anything while the Labor Party remains in government. And it is the reason why small business, almost to a man and woman, are desperate to get to the next election so they have the opportunity to get rid of this government and their colleagues in the corner, the Australian Democrats, who are so anti-small business and who have created the climate in which small businesses are incapable of making decisions for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I digress, I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I must say this: that ridiculous unfair dismissals legislation has put so many small business people off employing people. Whether they should be concerned or not is another question and, I think, principally they should be concerned. But the fear of that legislation means that small business people, who are now working 18 hours a day seven days a week, would like to put on additional staff but are scared out of doing so. That again is typical of this government's insensitivity. We have heard that it is going to change that legislation but we have not seen anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the talk, all the typical sorts of promises you will get from the Labor Party between now and the next election, people in Australia have just given up believing the Labor Party. They don't believe Mr Keating&mdash;quite rightly, I might add. They don't believe Mr Carr. Of course, his major election promise was that there would be no tollway on those roads. What did we have? We got to a month, I think, before he reneged on his promise. Mr Keating only left it two or three days after the election to renege on his. We had Mr Goss going around with that disgraceful campaign in Queensland, saying that a coalition government would sell hospitals&mdash;a claim that he knew was abjectly false but he went around saying it. It is just part of the Labor Party tactic: say anything, do anything before an election to get yourself elected. Lie your way through an election campaign and, when you get elected, when the people fall for those lies, change your mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I don't know why I am giving advice to the Labor Party but they would know this from their own polling: people in Australia no longer believe the Labor Party or any of their people. So it will not matter what Mr Keating says in the major speech he is going to make tomorrow&mdash;people just won't believe him, and rightly so. But, Mr Acting Deputy President, I digress. This legislation and the way it has been handled simply indicates again this government's insensitivity to the needs of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the resources that are available to an opposition, we are not in a position to go through this in any detail, but I doubt the government's estimation that not many companies are involved in this. As I say, in my small country town in North Queensland, without even trying to look or talk to people about it, I know three family businesses who would be caught. Multiplying that across Australia, there are a hell of a lot of small family businesses who have incorporated to run their business who would be caught by this legislation and would face additional accounting fees of between $30,000 and $80,000 to comply with this. So I say to the government and their advisers: please have a look at this; you have the resources, we don't. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Vanstone mentioned yesterday in her speech at the beginning of this debate, we want this legislation to go to the Senate committee on Friday. That committee could look at it. Those who have a real concern with this would have the opportunity to put their case and convince not only the government but the opposition of the strength of their argument. They could put forward some facts and figures that, unfortunately, with the very limited resources the government of the day gives us, we are not in a position to present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this matter is referred to the committee it will give those groups of small business people the opportunity to come forward and say, `This is where you are wrong. Here are some of the facts. This is what we think you should do. This is how you should do it.' It will then be up to the Senate committee, and ultimately the Senate, to determine whether there is a way in which this legislation can be amended to overcome some of the fears that have been expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the definition of what is large and what is small, this seems to be a reasonably good piece of legislation. However, it needs some clarification. Perhaps the minister, in responding, could indicate just how much of the corporate entity these proposals take in. Where there are a number of proprietary companies in a group, do the three requirements&mdash;assets of less than $5 million, operating revenue of less than $10 million, and fewer than 50 employees&mdash;apply to the whole group or to each individual company in the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested to me that, where companies operate through trusts, the determining factor on whether the bill applies to trusts is the independence of the trustee. If there is a relationship between the shareholders and directors of a trustee company and the beneficiaries of the trust the bill will apply. We might need to look at that provision because once we start including trusts in the same area as the corporate law we may be venturing into other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech the Attorney-General acknowledged that somewhere along the line we have to set an arbitrary limit. I do not know that any of the submissions so far made to us have come up with any alternatives. It is a question of where we set the arbitrary limit. Many small businesses&mdash;particularly those in the group who have contacted me&mdash;have high operating turnover or revenue because of the high value of the goods sold. The actual profit involved is quite minimal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume mentioned the fact that having assets of $5 million or more as one of the criteria for determining whether one has a so-called large company is quite ludicrous. I do not know much about Sydney or Melbourne, but I suspect that if you owned your own property in Sydney or Melbourne you would be up to the asset value already. I have not carefully considered Senator Baume's suggestion that it should be on liabilities, but certainly those things should be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempt to try and simplify the corporate law is a good one and the Liberal and National parties have been calling for it for some time. We support the general thrust of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before that I think the small business guide will be very useful. The idea of enabling small businesses and companies to have only one shareholder and one director is an improvement. There have been a lot of difficulties with small businesses and small companies, particularly in the instance where one of the two shareholders or directors dies. When husbands and wives are the sole directors and sole shareholders of proprietary companies and one dies and by will leaves all of their assets, including their shares in the proprietary company, to the surviving spouse you had a situation where there was only one director and one shareholder. That posed some difficulties, but that will be overcome by these new proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the coalition supports most of what is contained in this bill, there is the issue of what is a small company and what is a large company which needs to be looked at. I know that the Democrats are going to support the proposal to refer this issue to a committee, so it will go to a committee on Friday. I hope the government will accept the opportunity that will be given and make a genuine attempt to find a solution, in conjunction with the Liberal and National parties, the Democrats, the Greens and others, which will be of benefit to small business and provide the opportunity that small business in Australia needs&mdash;that is, cutting down the regulations and red tape and getting on with the business of earning money and employing people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about this particular bill. I will go into the details of what your government has done in relation to the timing of this bill. This bill will provide a means for small businesses with single members or directors to avoid the need for annual general meetings. This will be a very good thing for lots of small businesses. We applaud that measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also point out that earlier this year when the matter was brought before the House it was referred to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which I am Deputy Chairman. That committee examined several matters that were brought before it. We were given a very short time to look at the matter and we took evidence from 10 separate entities. As others have pointed out to the Senate yesterday and today, the most contention was about the definition of small and large proprietary companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the argument was really between the accountants' view that the law should reflect the reporting entity test which is accepted and well known in accounting circles, and the task force recommendation that there be a much simpler test. I point out to the Senate, as set out in the report of that committee of 2 March this year, that the committee recommended in favour of the simplified test for large and small companies being based on assets, revenue and the number of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended the three criteria approach rather than the accounting test approach. That decision was made based on simplicity of understanding for people in small business. In other words, it means that anyone running a small business can pick up the test, read and understand it and make a judgment themselves as to whether or not they qualify. Whereas, if you pick up the reporting entity test recommended by the accounting bodies, I defy anyone who is not an accountant to understand what that really is about. The net effect of that would be to throw everyone off to seek their accountant's advice rather than to make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence we took persuaded the committee that that should be the guiding thing and that we should have clarity in the law. That is the position the committee supported. The government is staying with that position, which the coalition supports. Since then, and due to the inordinate length of time that the government has taken since the report of 2 March to bring the matter forward here in the Senate&mdash;and I will go into that timing in a minute&mdash;there has been some concern raised by businesses around the borderline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure it is an arbitrary test. We acknowledge that fact in the committee's report. With an arbitrary test, there will always be people around the borderline. There has been genuine concern expressed by a reasonable number of businesses who will be around the borderline as to whether or not they should be forced to go the route of having to incur audit expenses.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very real problem. That is why we in the coalition are proposing to have a very short inquiry on this matter, perhaps a Friday committee, to gather evidence and see whether in fact the hurdles that have been set in the bill are appropriate and whether or not the level of those hurdles should be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee actually came to the conclusion that, of the three criteria set out in the bill, the turnover&mdash;that is, the revenue&mdash;and the assets were the important ones, which basically fits with international practice in comparison with the UK and particularly our neighbour New Zealand. We were less persuaded that the number of employees&mdash;that is, the 50 employees&mdash;was terribly relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, I think it is important that we seek further advice about this matter. I am sure that can be resolved very quickly. The question really is how many companies are involved and whether or not it is important for that information to be out in the public arena. It now appears that lots of family companies would exceed the revenue turnover of $10 million as well as the gross assets of $5 million. So I think that is well worth reviewing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the matter of timing. Again, I remind the Senate that the report was tabled on 2 March this year. If the government had regarded the matter as being urgent, it could easily have brought the matter forward from then. But what did in fact happen? The bill was read in the House of Representatives for the third time on 9 March. On 23 March this year, it was introduced into the Senate. But it was not until 29 June, as opposed to 23 March when it was introduced here, that the matter was brought forward for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a government decision, yet the government knew that lots of small businesses wanted relief from this matter of reporting, particularly with regard to annual general meetings. The matter was urgent for the business community but the government deliberately decided not to bring it forward. Worse than that&mdash;and because of the way the government business was managed in the Senate in the last week of June&mdash;it was brought in on the second last day and was fouled up, if you like, in the procedure of the last day and a half. Hence, it did not go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add insult to injury, the Prime Minister went out the next week and accused the coalition of holding up the passing of that bill. What an absolute hide to go out and tell such lies! We were not holding it up. We were happy for the bill to proceed, but we had to go through due and proper process in this place. For the Prime Minister to go out in the public arena and accuse the coalition of actually holding up the bill and therefore disadvantaging small business was really misleading the community. As a consequence, about a month ago I wrote a detailed letter setting out the facts of the matter to the National Small Business Forum, stating that the coalition was not to blame and could in no way be blamed for holding up this particular bill. We supported the bill, as I said before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good thing that has happened because of the delay&mdash;the government delay, not our delay&mdash;is that information has come to hand about concern about the definition of the criteria for large versus small. That is well worth spending a little time examining and examining urgently. I am sure that can be resolved. I know the government has had representations from the ACCI, motor traders and others pushing for a change in  the criteria. Doubling the criteria was one proposal. Another proposal was an exemption in the Corporations Act&mdash;in other words an escape clause in the corporations code&mdash;to allow the ASC to grant exemptions from the auditing requirement. So there are a couple of proposals that the government has had before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the definition of the criteria for large versus small, it is well worth looking at urgently. I am sure we can come to a sensible solution. Given that, the coalition will certainly support this bill and see its passage through this place, with the support I understand of basically all the parties. That would be a good thing for small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly to the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 and to our amendments, though not too briefly. We have no substantial problems with the bill itself. We think it is a good measure to enable a simplification of the law and to help small business. We originally sought to put an amendment on corrupt practices to this bill because we were advised that this is the most appropriate piece of legislation for the requirement of a register on corporate activities. We had expected it to be debated early last session. When it became apparent that it would not reach the floor until the dying moments of the last session, I decided to withdraw my amendment in the interest of the timely passage of the bill since it was unlikely to get up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time we have heard from the Attorney-General's Department that the OECD has proposed a united approach by its members on the issue of paying bribes to corrupt officials&mdash;a measure based on the US corrupt practices legislation. If this goes ahead, it will be stronger than our amendment was intended to be since it will involve criminal penalties against companies paying bribes. At this point, we have decided to stay with our decision to withdraw the amendment in support of an anti-corrupt practices regime. I wish to speak briefly to the issue, though, and note that we consider international corruption to be an important issue on which action should be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendments were basically measures in support of the international effort to stop what are known as corrupt practices or illicit payments. This is directed against bribery and graft. It is also part of the Greens (WA) effort to ensure that trade is conducted in a socially responsible manner. We gave copies of our draft amendment to the coalition, to the Democrats, to Senator Harradine's office and to the Business Council of Australia before the budget was brought down to get feedback. I understand that the coalition decided not to support our amendment because they had not had time for detailed consideration. I also understand they support the principle of acting to stop corruption and bribery internationally. I have noted that the government is currently negotiating on the OECD proposal, and I hope that all parties will act cooperatively on this issue in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bribery and corruption is not normal market behaviour. It may go on but it distorts markets and does not allow free trading. An environment of corruption can exclude companies and products through various means and there is no way to get redress or to appeal. Ultimately, allowing corruption and bribery is one of the best ways to increase the costs of corruption, including the costs of bribes that have to be paid for by access to markets or to gain contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing open or above board about bribery and graft and no way to appeal to a higher authority about what has occurred. The only thing to do is to try to up the ante, give a higher or bigger bribe and hope it will be effective. It is not a good way to do business. This is one of the reasons the Business Council accepts that an anti-corruption regime should exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give an example that I have come across recently. It appears that Indonesia's environment laws are quite good on the surface. There are lots of areas where it would appear they have stronger environmental laws than Australia's&mdash;which, in some instances, would not be difficult. But the reality is that very few people abide by the letter of the law. An example was given of a request in recent times that Australian aid be used for an Australian company to go into Indonesia and clean up a river which was being polluted by dioxins from several pulp mills in the area. If we were to look at the law, we would probably find that all the pulp mills were acting against the law that existed and were liable to a number of criminal penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the problem was&mdash;and everybody understood it&mdash;that it was unlikely that those companies would ever be forced to abide by the law. It may be that the companies involved had already bribed officials or it may be that at some stage in the future it could be a means of raising money. Somebody could pick on a particular law and a particular company and say, `Well, you have broken this law. Unless you pay this certain amount we will prosecute.' The reality is that it is extremely difficult in that situation. But the fact that it is so accepted in Australia that a company should be requesting taxpayers' funds to clean up a situation that clearly was caused illegally, gives an indication of how accepted that practice has come to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospect of business representatives being thrown in gaol because the bribes weren't big enough is not something business looks forward to. The difficulties of trading in markets where it is not certain whom to bribe, how much to bribe or what they will get for a bribe is not something they like. Trading in markets where big players like Lockheed can significantly influence governments is not an easy task. It would be better if the terms and conditions of trade were clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several nations are also trying to ensure that corruption does not become the norm. Nations like Singapore and Malaysia are strong opponents of corruption and they impose heavy penalties. But it is often not enough, especially where wages for government officers are hardly enough to cover living costs. In such a case, officers are prey to both greed and unscrupulous businesses even where their own governments impose substantial penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations Economic and Social Council has adopted a draft international agreement on corrupt practices. Some nations have taken strong unilateral measures. The United States has passed its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, making bribery by corporations operating overseas illegal and prosecutable under United States law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US may be big enough to take unilateral action and make bribery illegal. Australia, as a small international player, must accept that any attempt to make such actions illegal would compromise businesses trading in areas where corruption is the norm. So we have sought to take minimalist action to support the international move to ensure that anti-corruption actions will affect everyone equally and create a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment seeks simply to establish a register of payments, gifts and so on to intermediaries. This is part of the provision under the United Nations agreement and we have used language equivalent to that in the agreement. In order to avoid a huge compliance burden, we have tried to set the sums recorded as equivalent to those which must already be recorded under AusTRAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Business Council has looked to our amendment and can accept it, although it is never happy when the government regulates. It too would like to see a situation where it did not have to operate in a corrupt environment, as long as it applied to everyone. It accepts that we have not imposed penalties and tried to set sums recorded at a level which would reduce compliance costs. Whilst I have withdrawn our amendment, I put the Senate on notice that this is an important issue and one that we will continue to pursue in the future. I think the Democrats, Senator Harradine and the coalition support us in this in general terms and hope that we can get non-partisan support for efforts to end corruption in international trade and to support those other nations, including many developing nations, who wish to stamp this out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been said by other honourable senators on this side of the chamber, we in the coalition support the general thrust of the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995. The problem is that the bill has unforeseen consequences in relation to audit provisions. I feel it is appropriate to discuss exactly what consequences we are talking about and why those consequences must be guarded against here in the Senate before the bill receives a third reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic problem comes with the threefold test which has been proposed for the definition of a large company or a small company. The threefold test says that a company is a large company if it meets any two of three criteria. Those three criteria are that it has a turnover in excess of $10 million; that it has gross assets, not net assets, in excess of $5 million; or that the company has 50 or more employees. I understand what the government is aiming at but quite clearly these thresholds are unacceptably low. It is very easy for a company these days to have a turnover of $10 million&mdash;and $10 million in turnover, I should point out, does not mean $10 million in profit. Many companies have far more turnover than that and run at a loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no relationship, as anybody in business knows, between turnover on the one hand and profitability on the other hand. So that in itself gives rise to a lot of concern. If we are to say that there should be an obligation to have a company audited solely on the basis of, say, turnover and gross assets&mdash;and gross assets can include, for example, inventory&mdash;then one of the problems is that we impose a massive cost on that company. That cost has in itself a number of consequences. The first is that that cost can drag a company from being profitable to being unprofitable, with all the attendant problems in terms of loss of work, loss of opportunities and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, companies that remain profitable have a limited range of resources available to them in order to achieve their objectives. The simple question we have to ask ourselves is this: is the $20,000 or $30,000 in expected audit costs that these companies will have to bear the most efficient way those companies can utilise that money? Is this the optimum utilisation of that resource? I believe that the answer to that question is no; it is not the optimum utilisation of that resource. To answer that question we have to look at the rationale for saying that the company should be obliged to spend this money. The answer to that question is this: if this is not a publicly listed company, the only reason why you would want to have an auditor go over the accounts of the company is to ensure that the accounts are accurate for the benefit, not of shareholders, but of potential creditors of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do the creditors get real value from that company spending a minimum of $20,000 to $30,000 in additional accounting fees on auditing? I believe the answer is no. First of all, let us look at the sorts of companies that would be caught by this change in the legislation. I know private supermarkets that would get caught by this legislation. I know people who sell fruit and vegetables who would get caught by this legislation. I know even of a pie shop in North Queensland that would probably get caught by this because it sells a lot of pies to the army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to have a turnover of $10 million and to have gross assets of $5 million or more, but gross assets do not really tell us anything at all about the company. We should be looking at net assets or we should be looking at liabilities because, if you are talking about protecting the interests of potential creditors, surely the liabilities are a more important threshold test than their gross assets. It obviously has not been thought out in proper depth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we to do to the baker who just happens to have $5 million in gross assets because he owns the site for the business&mdash;he might be mortgaged, but he technically owns the site&mdash;the factory and the baking equipment, which all come into the category of gross assets, and, because he happens to sell pies to the army when they go to Rwanda, gets caught up because he has more than $10 million in turnover? What are we to do for that baker? Is it right that we should say to that person, who in all probability trades with most of his or her creditors on a cash basis anyway, `We are going to subject you to additional audit costs'? Is that the best way to encourage that business to succeed? The answer to that, quite clearly, has to be, `No, it is not.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the situation of a company which sells fruit and vegetables and which might have two or three retail outlets and either its turnover exceeds $10 million or, because maybe it has some truck drivers and some backroom staff and does some wholesaling as well, it has 50 employees or more at some time in the year. Are we to say to that company, `We are also going to oblige you to undergo this audit process'? There is going to be nothing achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who sell or consign the fruit do it on the basis of two or three consignments a week, so they are only at risk for one consignment, two consignments or maybe three consignments at most, and the company trades mainly on cash terms; yet, in spite of this, every year they are going to have the auditors crawl through each of the outlets and through the retail section. They will be sitting there counting apples, oranges, lemons and bananas. And for this privilege we, in our infinite wisdom here in the Senate, are going to say to them, `You can pay $20,000 to $30,000 minimum additional cost.' That is absolutely absurd!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is supposed to be corporate law simplification. This does not sound to me like corporate law simplification; this sounds like corporate law complexity, for the simple reason that there is a problem with the definition. That is why I believe it is incumbent upon this Senate to take the opportunity to refer the matter to a Senate committee for quick examination and to report back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those on the government side who would say, `This is merely another attem pt by the opposition to hurt small business by delaying this legislation.' Nothing could be further from the truth. The reason this problem has arisen only now is not because of the opposition; the problem arises, honourable senators, because of the conduct of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do I say that? When the small business organisations went to the Attorney-General to outline their concerns, to say to him, `This bill and this provision will have the effect of subjecting many thousands of small businesses to additional operating costs,' he and his department said to them, `Give us your thoughts. Give us your full submission. But don't go to the media about it just yet and don't go to the opposition because I am sure we can do something about it.' That was basically, I understand, the thrust of the discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the Attorney-General did nothing about it, because the provision in its original form is still in the bill as it sits before the Senate today. Had the Attorney-General not so misled the small business lobby organisations, they would have come to the opposition and we could have raised the issue when it went to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. It was only as a result of the careful examination by Senator McGauran&mdash;I acknowledge his contribution to that committee's report in his dissent&mdash;that we realised there was any problem at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition were generally of the belief that the bill's aims were good aims, were good intentions and were worthy of support. And indeed they are, but the task of the Senate is not to rubber stamp legislation and say, `Do we think the bill as a whole is good or bad?' Part of our task is to ensure that where there are unforeseen consequences of the legislation, those unforeseen consequences should and must be eliminated. So Senator McGauran deserves the congratulations of all honourable senators for the fine work he did in putting in his dissent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point remains: had the small business lobby organisations not been dissuaded by the Attorney-General from taking their concerns to the opposition or to the media, as was entirely their right, then maybe the situation could have been rectified much earlier. Maybe the situation could have been resolved before the second reading debate on the bill was resumed in this chamber yesterday. Maybe that is what should have happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the opposition who are at fault for the delay in the passage of the legislation. Ultimately the fault for the delay in the passage of the legislation lies with the Attorney-General because he had the opportunity to fix the matter up. He did not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the opposition would have had the opportunity to address the matter much earlier. We were never given that full opportunity because the Attorney-General misled the lobby groups for his own political advantage, not for the good governance of this country. Let us remember one thing: the task of the Attorney-General is to oversee legislation in the best interests of the country, not in the best interests of Mr Michael Lavarch or of the Labor Party. Quite clearly the Attorney-General has failed in his duty to ensure that that took place. There was no way in which the opposition could address this matter any earlier than yesterday because the parliament was in recess and it was not possible for the opposition to further refer the matter to a Senate committee for quick examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delay is a delay which we do not like and which we would like to not have had exist, but it is a delay which, unfortunately, must now take place if we are to do our proper duty, as senators of the parliament of Australia, and ensure that the legislation to which we give our agreement is good legislation. That is the key. People get hurt when parliament does not do its job properly. That is why we are here debating this at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to talk about the general concept of auditing, it is also appropriate that we talk about the general disclosure provisions. Even if these accounts are audited, I do not think it really makes much difference at all to a potential creditor of a company. I say that as one who has had enormous experience in talking with insolvency practitioners, in working with the insolvency profession and in talking with credit managers. In reality, the change that occurred at the time the Corporations Law was introduced was a change which eliminated the previous reporting requirements on companies. Previously companies were obliged to file every year their profit and loss statement and their balance sheet. Those documents were public documents that were available from the then National Companies and Securities Commission, now the Australian Securities Commission. Senator Jones, on the other side, in his former life before coming into the Senate, in his business dealings with other people, may have had cause to look at these documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system provided people with financial information on which they could make their own assumptions. At the end of the day, business people are in the business of making judgments and making assumptions about other people with whom they do business. A good businessman or a good businesswoman is good at making those assumptions; a poor one is poor at making those assumptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the change in legislation which was brought in by the Corporations Law meant in many cases that those profit and loss and balance sheets were not generally available to the public. Instead, when you scrutinised a company, you merely got the summary financial data, and the summary financial data does not provide enough information on which to make a balanced or accurate judgment. You need to look not just at what are the net assets or the net liabilities or the total assets or the total liabilities; you need to look at exactly what they are. You need to look at how many of the liabilities are current liabilities; at how many of the liabilities are non-current liabilities; at which of those liabilities are liabilities to directors and shareholders, because a corporate manager can then form a view as to whether those liabilities are likely to be called; at which of them are secured and over which assets are they secured. These are the things that people need to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a company has a lot of current liabilities and a small amount of non-current liabilities, yet all its assets are tied up in real estate, you could form the view that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term liabilities as and when they fall due. In fact, an increase in current liabilities with the same asset structure&mdash;that is, an asset structure that is tied up in fixed assets&mdash;is perhaps indicative of the fact that the company is trading whilst it is on the road to becoming insolvent. None of this information do we glean from the current system of having summary financial data. If we have summary financial data which is audited, it still makes no difference because the core information is not available to the people who have to make the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe I am a voice in the wilderness, but I honestly believe that we would be better off going back to the system of obliging people to file their profit and loss and balance sheets every year and making those documents public documents, as then we would not need to have auditors. In reality, it is then a matter of the business people being provided with sufficient information and being able to make the decisions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a private enterprise system&mdash;even in a free enterprise system, something I distinguish&mdash;we have to be careful we do not develop the mollycoddle mentality which says, `We will have people who will be responsible for your bad decisions.' Of course, if you have all these companies audited, people will say, `Look, the auditor is to blame; I am not to blame.' All you will see will be a blow-out in suits where creditors of companies which become insolvent go and sue the auditor. Really, that does not aid the administration of the legal system in this country, and it really does not focus business on what is important. Business ought to be focused on making good business decisions; business should not be focused on whether they are likely to win by suing this auditor or that auditor of a company which has become insolvent. That is not what business should be about. Business should not be about litigating; it should be about going out and doing business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the general thrust, the philosophical concept, behind the legislation is flawed, and it does not do anything to achieve the objective of giving people better information on which to make business decisions. All it does is put somebody else in their place, somebody else they can blame. At the end of the day this country, be it in business or otherwise, will only succeed when Australians are willing to take responsibility for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may address a comment to the gallery through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I say to the students who are watching today that this is very important. We all have to be responsible for ourselves, and legislation which undermines the principle of self-responsibility is, I believe, bad legislation for the country. I believe that we can rectify this problem but that it does need to go to a Senate committee. It needs proper examination, and the small business sector of this country needs to have confidence that its concerns will be addressed by this parliament at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the title of the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill suggests, it is the first bill to emerge from the government's corporate law simplification program, which was announced in the 1993 budget. The program began quite well with the appointment of the simplification task force&mdash;a task force that was made up of many specialists in plain English and in corporate law and parliamentary draftsmen. It undertook a consultative process with extensive community consultations and distributed its findings far and wide amongst the public inviting public comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the work of the task force, the bill was referred to the committee to which I belong, the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. It was referred after the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on 8 February 1995 in the House of Representatives. The committee sought public response from many bodies representing those that would be interested in corporate law and we undertook many public hearings. As the Senate can see, there has been, generally speaking, a thorough, properly canvassed and balanced undertaking by the government and the parliament to hear as many views as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, it has been accepted that the bill, in its entirety, is a step forward in simplifying corporate law. But as has been properly announced by this side of the house, there are, nevertheless, still many controversial and very hard to accept propositions contained within it. The main objection relates to the proposed change to the law for the proprietary companies&mdash;the distinction between exempt proprietary and non-exempt proprietary companies is now to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stated effect of this change is to eliminate the current requirement on small companies to prepare financial reports for filing with the Australian Securities Commission. The bill contains those all-important three criteria. There is now a new distinction between large and small proprietary companies, based on the company's gross operating revenue not to exceed $10 million, assets not to exceed $5 million, and the number of employees to be 50 or more. Should a company meet any two of these three requirements, it is obliged to submit fully audited accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it is this arbitrary definition of small and large that is in dispute, particularly as it will place an extra financial burden on the companies once exempt but which now fall within the category of large. Those companies now deemed to be large have previously had no need, nor any want, to produce costly audited accounts. Neither shareholders nor the public had any use for these audited accounts, nor will they in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been stated by previous speakers, the Australian Chamber of Commerce has put together the estimated costs, on average no doubt, of what the new audit requirements will impose&mdash;it is between $25,000 and $40,000 per company. Many of these companies are family companies for which there would be no public benefit in undertaking a costly audit procedure. The Chamber of Commerce highlights the motor trades as being one area that will be particularly affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that $25,000 to $40,000, it can be argued that you could start from a benchmark of about $12,000, but that would still be an added cost of $12,000 for the smallest companies. However, $12,000 would be a more reliable figure for the smallest companies&mdash;those fish and chip shops that Senator O'Chee spoke about and the very small bread shops. Those small businesses would face an additional audit cost of around $12,000, but that would be $12,000 that they would not have and an unnecessary $12,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporations and securities committee undoubtedly found the question very difficult to resolve and they spent a great deal of time pondering the matter. In fact, they even conceded that the small versus large test is as arbitrary a test as the other options put forward. Nevertheless, they finally recommended that the small versus large test be given preference, particularly as there is a perceived safety net for the small versus large test as they saw it. That perceived safety net is: firstly, there is an ASC discretion, both to require a small company to prepare accounts and to relieve large companies of reporting requirements&mdash;so the ASC can step in either side of that grey area; and, secondly, company members will be able, by virtue of the provisions which allow five per cent of the shareholders to do so, to require a small company to prepare accounts. So that was their idea of a safety net. It probably finally convinced them to recommend the most arbitrary test of small versus large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator O'Chee so graciously pointed out, I have tabled my own dissenting report in the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities report on this key matter, rejecting the so-called small versus large test applied to reporting entities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a matter of objection by the powerful representative bodies of: the Institute of Chartered Accountants; the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants; and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. During the committee hearing I judged a more compelling case was put forward by the accounting bodies to support the reporting entity test over the small versus large test. The reporting entity test is defined as, and is, Australian accounting standard 1025. So it already exists in accounting standards and the Corporations Law, and was put forward as the preference of the accounting bodies. The reporting entity test is defined as an entity:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in respect of which it is reasonable to expect the existence of users dependent on general purpose financial reports for information which will be useful to them for making and evaluating decisions about the allocation of scarce resources, and includes but is not limited to the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) a listed corporation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) a borrowing corporation;</PARA>
<PARA>Albeit arbitrary, as a far more accepted and understood test not only in the marketplace but in the Corporations Law as it stands and as an accounting standard, it seems infinitely more acceptable to the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My support for the reporting entity test is substantially based on the fact that: firstly, the test is a well-established and accepted accounting standard; and, secondly, it is simpler or at least no more arbitrary than the small versus large test, given the three required size factors, namely, gross assets, revenue and employment are extremely arbitrary&mdash;and, as pointed out by Senator Baume, the asset valuation can easily be manipulated. For example, the directors' valuations at best are never reliable&mdash;they can be based on historical factors and not current values, and all this can place it under the threshold of $5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you were to seek an independent valuation of your assets&mdash;the most up-to-date valuation undertaken by a real estate firm&mdash;it would cost you another $10,000 to $12,000. That would enable you to meet the auditing requirement which would cost you another $10,000 to $12,000 or more. The costs are piling up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about revaluations from year to year as your assets gyrate up and down in this most uncertain marketplace? One year you are producing audited accounts and the next year you are not. What is the benefit of an audited account if it has no continuity? One year you seek to pick up the audited accounts and they are not there because the directors have fallen under the threshold. This ludicrous situation can occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second criteria concerns the employment factor, and this is the most ludicrous of all. It is very hard to understand exactly how this is going to work because that has never been spelt out. The factor of 50 employees or more will defer employment. If you have 48 or 49 employees&mdash;just under the 50 benchmark&mdash;are you really going to employ that extra person, or those extra two or three people? If you do, the moment you employ one extra person at an average salary of $15,000 to $18,000 you hit the threshold of 50 employees and that is another cost that you will have to audit to your accounts. That extra person will not only cost you his salary or wage, but he will cost you the auditor's fee of between $12,000 and $14,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to be very difficult for small business to make the decision to employ that one extra person because the business simply hits the 50 threshold and has to go into auditing accounts. It is detrimental to employment. This is a key matter in the legislation that has not been properly tackled by the government. The government has tried to snuff out any controversial public comment on the matter by seducing the lobby groups by dealing only with them and leading them on to believe that they would get a proper result, but dumping them at the last moment. How these lobby groups and representatives of small business were hooked on this matter is bewildering. I thought they would have shown a bit more experience in dealing with the government on small business matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the small business representatives have spent too long in Canberra and have forgotten just how this government treats small business and the Australian public. The government has lied to small business and to the Australian public many times over. We are now in a situation where we have to try and save them. We do that by supporting Senator Vanstone's proposed amendment to send this matter to a Friday committee where we can further scrutinise this very important matter in relation to small and large businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having outlined the main concerns I restate that, generally speaking, there is no doubt that this bill as a whole is significant to the Corporations Law and is generally supported. I urge the Australian Democrats and the Greens to support Senator Vanstone's proposed amendment. </PARA>

It is the first bill in the corporate law simplification program. There may be three or four more bills over the next few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I could pick up on some of the points raised by speakers during the debate and make some comments in response. I will conclude my remarks with more general comments on the bill. This might assist the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Senator Margetts's proposed amendment, I make the point that the government appreciates the withdrawal of that amendment, which was strictly not relevant to the bill. The concerns raised by Senator Margetts at least need to be addressed. I can assure the Senate that the government is already considering a recommendation of the council of the OECD on bribery in international business transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation calls on member countries to, amongst other things, consider taking a range of domestic measures relating to civil, criminal and taxation issues with a view to preventing bribery of foreign public officials in connection with international business transactions. The government responded to the recommendation by establishing an interdepartmental committee last year which is chaired by representatives from the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has been asked to prepare a submission to the government on what Australia's response to the OECD recommendation should be. As part of the process the committee is consulting with key business and other interest groups. It is expected that the committee will report to the government later this year. I hope that assists Senator Margetts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to a couple of points raised by Senator Baume. Senator Baume stated that large companies could be restructured to avoid the audit obligation.

The bill contains a sized test for assets and revenue which requires that they be consolidated. This is to be done in accordance with the relevant accounting standards.

The nature and scope of this accounting standard on control are properly matters for the Accounting Standards Board, which is responsible for making these standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume also referred to the massive lack of commercial experience in preparing this bill. The bill was prepared by a four-person task force which included a private practitioner who was experienced in commercial law. It was also discussed with the Attorney-General's private sector consultative group, which includes representatives of small and large business. In addition, the criteria are based on comparable tests used in the United Kingdom and Ontario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler queried whether the abolition of various company registers would prejudice people being able to access information about companies. For Senator Spindler's edification, the information on these registers is either unnecessary or will be readily available from the ASC. Business and professional advisers are increasingly finding that the ASC is a convenient means of obtaining information about companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I think it is very important that professional people have access to that information, I am sure that Senator Spindler appreciates the concern I have that ordinary citizens have access to that information. My advice is that there will be either the same or easier access to that information through the ASC. We should feel comforted to know that information will not be less accessible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill actually contains significant improvements to the law on share buy-backs, company registers and proprietary companies. The changes will greatly assist Australian business, especially small business. Many of the changes, and the plain English drafting of the bill, have been welcomed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delay in the introduction of the bill has been a matter of concern to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the government. Business and professional advisers are keenly awaiting a number of the changes to be introduced with this bill. They include: the possibility for companies to set up with one director and one member; the introduction of streamlined rules for companies to buy back their own shares; the abolition of AGMs for proprietary companies; the removal of requirements to keep various company registers; and the removal of the requirement for small proprietary companies to  prepare accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already the delay in the passage has meant that most of Australia's 900,000 proprietary companies will have to lodge key financial data with the ASC for another year, which is an unnecessary and wasteful obligation. In the debate on this bill, opposition senators raised a supposedly new concern about an obligation under the bill for large proprietary companies to have their accounts audited. It is the government's view that this is an appropriate obligation in view of the economic significance of the companies. They are often major trading enterprises with significant employers and numerous trade creditors. An audit gives a level of assurance about their financial position. The ASC does have a discretion to relieve companies of this obligation in hard cases&mdash;and I will comment about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns raised by some business organisations are nothing more than special pleading. It is not surprising that the companies affected do not want a new obligation imposed upon them; indeed, it would be surprising if they did. The question that needs to be answered is whether this obligation is in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at a few facts. Companies which are caught by the new obligation are in fact substantial businesses and not by any means small. They have to satisfy at least two of three criteria: assets of at least $5 million, revenue of at least $10 million, and 50 or more employees. These figures were the subject of substantial consultation. They were first released in a proposal by the simplification task force in March 1994. They were included in a draft bill released for three months comment in July 1994. They were in the bill as introduced into parliament last December. They were examined by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, and its report on the bill was tabled in March 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultation process did not provide any justification for changing the figures. A range of views was expressed, with some suggestions that they were too low as well as some suggestions that they were too high. The parliamentary committee did not recommend that they be changed, although it did ask the Attorney-General to look in particular at the use of the employee criteria. This was done and the Attorney-General indicated that he did not propose to make any change at this stage, although he did give a commitment to keep them under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry wrote to the parliamentary committee at the time of its review. The ACCI stated that while the figures were arbitrary they supported the bill and did not believe there was any reason to delay passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position in comparable overseas jurisdictions also supports the view that the audit requirement is not unreasonable. In Ontario, a company is subject to an audit obligation if its assets are $Can2.5 million, or if its gross operating revenues are $Can5 million. In the UK, a company is subject to an audit obligation if it meets certain criteria based on operating revenue, assets and employees. The asset and revenue criteria are in fact much lower than those in the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at industry claims that they are being unfairly treated. No new information has been produced. On the best information available, it has been estimated that only two per cent of companies will be subject to this obligation. That is a very small proportion of proprietary companies. Those figures have not been challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of misleading claims have been made by the industry. It has been suggested the bill would have unintended consequences, whereas the effects of the bill are well known. The estimated cost of an average audit being $25,000 to $40,000 is massively exaggerated. It has been suggested that the ASC would not have a discretion to deal with special circumstances where an audit might not be justified. The ASC already has a wide discretion to exempt a company from accounting and auditing obligations where compliance would give rise to an unreasonable burden on the company. The issue has been raised with the ASC in the context of a new audit obligation. The ASC has indicated it would be prepared to look sympathetically at granting exemptions which did not cut across the intention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In applying the unreasonable burden test, the ASC has indicated that it would look at whether the public benefit in disclosure of audited accounts would be outweighed by the costs incurred. It has also been suggested, according to Senator Vanstone, that somehow the relevant business groups were misled into believing their concerns would be addressed by a government sponsored amendment. This is simply not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two meetings and several telephone discussions were held, at which concerns were discussed in detail. An undertaking was given that issues raised would be considered and reported to the Attorney-General. This undertaking was met. Furthermore, in light of the concerns raised about the ASC discretion, the chairman of the ASC was contacted to obtain clarification of their position. The view of the chairman was conveyed to the representative of the industry groups, and he indicated that this was a very positive development. In essence, nothing raised by the industry groups justifies a further review or any further delay. However, it seems that the special pleadings seems to have worked for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If the issue of the size criteria is to be referred to a committee, it would make sense for that to be the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The committee has a statutory function to look at the operation of the Corporations Law and proposed amendments. It is familiar with this bill and the issues raised by small-large distinction. I understand the chairman of the committee has indicated that the committee would be able to look at the matter in a timely manner. I thank senators for their contribution to the debate. I hope the points of query raised during the second reading stage have been answered. I think it should be very clear that the government sees no need for this reference. If it is going to happen, we would prefer that it go to the joint committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I used a relative term, Minister, `the most base'. It does not mean they are very base; it just means the most base. I do not believe even the most base personality opposite could suggest that there are people on this side who are actually in favour of racial hatred, who are in favour of people deliberately setting out to upset and demean others simply because of their race or, for that matter, because of their religion, how they look or whatever else. It just does not jell. This bill is not about who is more opposed to racial hatred. It is not a contest&mdash;a breast-beating contest&mdash;to see who can proclaim most loudly that they are opposed to something that I would expect every member of the federal parliament would be opposed to. I say, without any doubt in my mind, that there would not be a federal member of parliament who would say, or in the heart of hearts believe, that they are in favour of racial hatred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about the best way to deal with any examples of racial hatred that we see in the community. What is to be done about it? None of us like it. What is to be done? Is there something that the Commonwealth ought to be doing? That is what this bill is about. It is equally, as I say, not about who is more welcoming of a multicultural society or who welcomes migrants more into this country. My party&mdash;contrary to what some members opposite would seek to portray in the communities&mdash;has a very proud record in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to the 1960s&mdash;nearly a third of a century ago but, nonetheless, I was alive then&mdash;it was a coalition government that abolished the very abhorrent White Australia policy. That decision led to a very welcome inflow of many people from a wide range of ethnic and racial backgrounds. It was a Liberal government that established the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs and SBS TV, and introduced a very wide range of multicultural settlement services that today remain the basis of Australia's multicultural policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a coalition government that welcomed to Australia the first boat people from South East Asia in the late 1970s and the early 1980s and, as many will remember here, against the strident opposition of some of my colleagues opposite, certainly of the Labor Party of the day. So this is not a contest&mdash;and I hope it does not develop into one; it should not be&mdash;about whose party is more in favour of multiculturalism, more opposed to racial hatred. It is about the best way to deal with the ugly examples of racial hatred that we face from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said&mdash;and the government has yet to match this commitment&mdash;that we believe the best way to deal with these ugly incidents is an education campaign. We have been prepared to commit $10 million towards such an education campaign. We are surprised the government has not stepped in and agreed with that proposal as a sensible way to proceed. After all, in one of the other very important areas that you have an interest in, Madam Acting Deputy President, domestic violence, the value of education campaigns is clearly understood and supported on all sides. So there is no doubt about the value of an education campaign as a policy tool to implement change, to try to deal with racism when it rears its ugly head. We have been prepared to make that commitment. We look forward to the government finally admitting&mdash;hopefully sooner rather than later&mdash;that it supports such a commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government seems hell-bent on believing that its way is the only way to proceed, and that is by way of a racial hatred bill. The bill was not available to us until just before it was to be introduced, despite the fact the government wished to run the debate in the community. But once we saw the bill we had a good look at it and we made no bones about the fact that we would oppose it. We do not see this as the appropriate way to deal with and respond to those incidents in the community, which we are all repulsed by. We believe education is the appropriate way. But if there is to be a legislative sanction to add to the armoury to oppose this sort of behaviour then this is not it. This is not the appropriate way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two reasons that we oppose this bill. The first, and perhaps the most central, is the proposed new section 61. That section says that a person must not, with the intention of inciting racial hatred against another person or a group of people, do an act in private if the act is firstly reasonably likely in all circumstances to incite racial hatred against other persons or a group of people and is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group. That criminal sanction says nothing about associating violence with hatred. It makes it a criminal sanction for you to incite hatred in another even though you are not encouraging them to act in any violent way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You hate a particular group yourself for one of a myriad of reasons, you believe it is justified and you want to pass that on. You want others to agree with you. You are encouraging them to agree with you. You are inviting them to share your hatred. But you are not the sort of person who would go and burn down a picket fence or bash someone in the face and you do not want to encourage anyone else to do that. You want them to understand why you hate this group of people, why you feel that way. This is very much associated with feelings. You want them to feel the same way too. For that, this government will put you in gaol for up to one year. We say that is wrong; it is a limitation on freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all understand that free speech is not entirely free. There are already some sanctions. So let us not pretend that by saying we are supporters of free speech we are somehow ignorant and think that speech is always completely free. We understand that there are limitations on speech. But we think you have to be very careful when you add to those limitations. This government was happy to introduce a bill to ban political advertising, which is the most useful way to share views at the time of elections about what one party or another is doing. It is an essential part of the political process. The government that proposed this bill was happy to ban that freedom of speech and put an extra limit on it because it was just damned well inconvenient. The High Court chucked out that bill and said that it was not on. You cannot limit speech in that way. It is essential to our system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that there are sometimes cases for limits to be made. Defamation laws are one example. But we say that this is not one. You should be able to, within the existing limits, say what you like. If it offends someone, but you do not incite people to violence, you should be able to say it. No law should try to engineer in your mind what you ought to think about another group, or make it a criminal sanction for you to feel a particular way, express that feeling and want others to agree with you. We say that that is wrong. It is social engineering at its worst, and it is a most unnecessary limitation on freedom of speech. For that reason, we will not support the government's composition of criminal sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also has civil sanctions which we do not support for a number of reasons. The government has had its problems with civil sanctions in other bills as a consequence of the Brandy decision. The states are now moving to implement their own civil sanctions. They do not have the same separation of powers problems that we have. We think it is time to reflect on the degree to which we keep adding to that list of activities. If you undertake them, you can find yourself getting a letter saying that someone wants to drag you off to one tribunal or another. Let us not take that out of perspective. Let us not suggest that we are saying that consultative tribunals are not a useful way to resolve disputes. Take it exactly as it is. We are concerned about the rate at which we are doing that. We think we need to pause before we continue to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also think that, in any event, the drafting of that civil sanction is in itself peculiarly broad. You could find yourself dragged off to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to explain yourself. If you are a normal citizen who does not have lawyers in the family or friends who are lawyers and you get such a letter, you think, `Hell. What is happening here?' You get some legal advice. While we might understand the conciliatory nature of some of these proceedings, a lot of normal citizens are not so informed. So they get legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about doing an act that is likely in all the circumstances to offend or insult someone. It goes on to deal with acts that humiliate or intimidate. I see that there are school children in the galleries. I remember that when I was at school people offended me every other day. I probably said things that offended others. It is still happening and it will go on happening. To suggest that, because someone says something you find offensive, you should be able to run off to the human rights commission is breathtaking. What offends one person may be water off a duck's back to another. There is no objective standard here. If it is to be reasonably likely in all the circumstances, it must relate back to that person. We are unsatisfied with the civil sanctions. We think the criminal sanction is appallingly drafted. For that reason, we have put out our own exposure draft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our exposure draft shows the government the fashion in which it should have proceeded. Our exposure draft creates a criminal sanction for inciting hatred, but it associates the incitement to hatred with violence. No-one likes people hating. It is just a part of life and you go through it. Every now and then, something happens and you hate it. You meet someone who you do not like. You may get to the point of hating them. Hate is not a good thing, but it is a part of life. We have to learn how to handle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we get to the stage of acting or wanting to act on hate&mdash;when you punch someone in the face or incite someone else to do that or you want to burn down their house, picket fence or garden&mdash;and causing someone else physical harm to their person or their property, and you encourage others to do that, that behaviour should be the subject of a criminal sanction. The limitation is not just on expressing your view but on starting to encourage other people to do nasty things to people, such as damage their property or person. You are encouraging by your words some action to result from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wholeheartedly agree that that kind of behaviour should be the subject of a criminal sanction. For our exposure draft we chose to follow very closely the legislation in New South Wales, which by all accounts has worked very well. We think that that is the appropriate criminal sanction to have: not one that bans free speech full stop but one that bans speech that incites violence against property or person. That is where to draw the line in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated earlier, we do not agree with the civil remedies as drafted by the government. We are a bit apprehensive about them. We are pleased the states are moving to do as they choose in that respect and, for that reason, we did not choose to include in our exposure draft the civil remedies that are included in the state legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous amount of breast beating going on in this area by some of my colleagues opposite determined to show that they are opposed to racial hatred. As I said, we too are opposed to racial hatred, but we believe the way to do it is by a sensible education campaign. We have been prepared to commit $10 million towards that and we look forward to the government agreeing to match that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that a legislative sanction is required, we believe that legislative sanction should be limited to speech which encourages and incites violence. That you should not be allowed to do, but you should be allowed to make a speech which expresses your own view, repulsive as it might be&mdash;a view of hatred and encouraging others to agree with you&mdash;without going to gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to end by coming to that point, highlighting that we are opposed to a straight limitation on freedom of speech. Speech which is not inciting violence, we think, you ought to be able to proceed with. That is why in our exposure draft we have chosen to have a criminal sanction which would put in goal people who incite hatred on the basis of racial grounds, and put them in the gaol for quite a bit longer than this government would. There are much tougher sanctions in our bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only reason I chose to end on this. Sadly, in the community there has been by accident or design&mdash;and I certainly hope it is accident&mdash;some very misleading information about the government's bill. I personally feel the Attorney would have done himself some credit if he had chosen to clear up those misunderstandings, because they are misunderstandings&mdash;as I said, created by accident or design&mdash;by people who ought to know better, who are out there bagging my party every other day on this issue and who are holding themselves out to the ethnic communities as people who are informed. I do not mind people doing that. If you think you have something to say, you reckon you know about it and you can help others by informing them, well and good; but do not do that if you either have not bothered to inform yourself or are deliberately seeking to deceive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of you will have heard the name Victor Rebikoff on the radio every other day in this place and heard him getting stuck into my party for our position. Mr Rebikoff had this to say about the government's bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real important fact of the racial hatred bill before the parliament is that the end result of criminal sanctions really only applies where racial incitement leads to bodily injury or property damage&mdash;that's the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just untrue. The government's criminal sanction, the proposed new section 60, can lead you to a criminal sanction, can send you to gaol, even though you are not encouraging any physical damage to property or person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rebikoff has simply not told the truth. Maybe he misunderstood. Maybe he was misinformed. But someone in his position should not rush out to the airwaves, purport to speak for the ethnic communities around Australia, and get it so badly wrong. Helene Teischman, who acts as the secretariat to the Ethnic Coalition of Australia, does exactly the same. In a transcript of interview, six, seven, eight, nine, 10&mdash;possibly 11&mdash;times she creates the impression that people should not worry about the government's bill; that they should go for it because it will only get at people who incite hatred that leads to violence. That is rubbish. If she did not know then, she must know now that the government's Racial Hatred Bill would put in gaol people who incite hatred even if it is not associated in any way whatsoever with violence. For people who purport to lead a community to mislead that community by accident or design is a disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill ought to be passed. The arguments in favour of our doing so far outweigh those to the contrary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's destiny has made her a multicultural society.

It is therefore essential for the wellbeing of each and every one who lives in this country that all its inhabitants are assured of its commitment to their true interests. When as a nation we embrace the qualities of communal cohesion, generosity, equality, justice, compassion and equity, we go a long way to ensuring this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation of a democracy such as Australia shows those values in which it places store.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to look at what the parliaments of this country have made criminal. In Western Australia, a person `who, not being a member of either House of Parliament, unlawfully publishes any false or scandalous defamatory matter touching the conduct of any member or members of either House of Parliament as such member or members is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for 2 years and to a fine of $1,000'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar laws apply in other Australian jurisdictions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Society would have interesting values were it to punish its citizens for publishing material prejudicial to the reputation of politicians and foreign potentates but allows them to harm their compatriots for racial reasons. In New South Wales it is a crime to wilfully enter upon any part of a fountain erected in a public place. In South Australia the same is the case where a person who, without the authority of the occupier of the land on which animals are kept in the course of primary production, unfastens and leaves unfastened a gate on or leading to the land. In Victoria any person who wilfully and without lawful justification or excuse, the proof of which lies on him or her, disquiets any meeting of persons lawfully assembled for religious worship, can be gaoled for up to three months.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reading of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show many and persistent points of order taken during question time in this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider the range of people who feel they have a full stake in the country they live in, the more likely they are to hold together as a nation where there is peace, order and good government. This is what the founders of the Commonwealth intended and what its citizens have sought since its establishment. The greater the peace, order and good government of a country, the better for all who reside in it. In any community, the better the life of the weak, the poor, the disadvantaged, the plain and the different, the better the life of the strong, the rich, the advantaged, the glamorous and the mainstream. Where a society allows and even encourages its members to abuse their fellows on the grounds of race, it diminishes the force within it making for a worthy community. Nazi Germany is the most graphic example of this in the 20th century. What is now happening in old Yugoslavia, in Sri Lanka and Turkey gives other examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That freedom of speech is needed for the right operation of a liberal and democratic society has been an axiom for a long time. The High Court has recently declared it basic to proper political debate in Australia. But, in doing so, the highest judicial body in this country set limits to its range. Sir Gerard Brennan, who is now the Chief Justice of the High Court, when giving his decision in Theophanous v Herald and Weekly Times Limited, said:</PARA>

<PARA>Australia's history and culture has made it a multicultural society which its laws are obliged to keep viable and vibrant. It needs legislation to ensure that those within its shores who might be tempted to do so are inhibited from hurting others because of their race, colour, national or ethnic origin.

Why should this country condone people who give expression to racial hatred, which brings both fear and harm to those who as its citizens are entitled to look to it for the protection of their wellbeing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is a tremendous country and we have very energetic and enterprising people. In spite of the best efforts of this government to curtail that energy and enthusiasm, there are still a lot of people in Australia who are doing tremendous work for Australia and for Australia's position in the world in an economic sense. I take the opportunity today in this debate on matters of public interest to mention a couple of the enterprises that I had the opportunity to inspect during the parliamentary recess so as to make parliament aware of the good things that are happening in our country in spite of the best efforts of the Labor Party to curtail them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with my Western Australian colleague Senator John Panizza, I had the opportunity to accept an invitation from the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments to inspect the Ord River scheme and what is happening in the Kununurra area. The extension of the Ord River project is a very exciting scheme. Those of my age would remember when, many years ago, the Menzies Liberal-Country Party government set up the Ord River scheme. It was at the time, and has been subsequently, the subject of cynicism and criticism about it being enormously subsidised, but all of that is now behind the Ord River project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last year, $35 million worth of agricultural exports were produced in the Ord River area and there are plans to double that production in the fairly near future. In the Ord River area, primary producers produce melons, chickpeas and all sorts of small crops. A wide variety of crops is grown in the area and, of course, producers have recently gone into a major expansion of Australia's sugar growing areas. Senator Panizza and I were conducted around the scheme by Mr Peter McCosker who is the project officer working for the Western Australian government. I also spoke with a Western Australian minister, Mr Monty House, about the plans that his government and the Northern Territory government have for this very significant area. It is a very exciting prospect. It is a project which I personally support and I would think that the coalition as a whole would be very keen to support the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments in that significant expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, I know that the two state governments have invited a number of politicians up to that area to show them over the site. I said, `Well, what do you want from us? How much money are you seeking?' They indicated that they were not seeking any money at all. They simply want the federal government and federal parliamentarians to understand what is happening and to assist them in promoting the scheme. The biggest problem being faced by the Ord project is&mdash;would you believe&mdash;the native title legislation, and that problem is not just being experienced by the project organisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal groups in the area who want to take part in the expansion simply do not know what their rights are: they do not know how to go through native title legislation and they do not know what they can do and what they cannot do. It is a complete mess. If I came back from the Ord with any underlying understanding of what is needed, it is that some clarification&mdash;from the viewpoints of both the Aboriginals and the project developers&mdash;of the native title legislation is essential. The government refuses to understand it, but the problem has to be addressed before the Ord can expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that a Queensland hi-tech company is developing the new sugar mill in the Ord. I was also very interested to hear of the plans for the sugar industry in Western Australia. I come from the lower Burdekin district in Queensland which is, without argument, one of the best sugar growing areas in the world. In my former life as a solicitor in a small country town, I became aware of how the Queensland sugar industry has been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in the west they are looking at establishing a complete industry without any government regulation and not much government involvement. It will all be done by contractors, as I understand it. They have a rather different way of distributing the proceeds of the sugar crop&mdash;that is, different from what happens in Queensland and, I assume, New South Wales. They are proposing that, out of the total proceeds from the sale of the sugar crop, there will be a certain amount set aside to cover the base costs of the sugar growers. There will also be an amount set aside for harvesting costs and an amount set aside, as I understand the proposal, for the milling costs. Once those three components are paid out so that everyone gets their base costs, the balance&mdash;the profits, so to speak&mdash;will then be distributed between the millers and the growers on the basis of a proportion of their capital investment in the industry. That is different from the Queensland industry in that the division of crop proceeds is a continuing and running sore in the Queensland industry and it has been since time immemorial. It will be interesting to see how the Western Australian system works out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also saw, whilst visiting the Ord, what I think might be the first privately funded hydro scheme in Australia. It is being constructed by Civil and Civic and I think Lend Lease are the financiers of it. It is a very interesting project. Private enterprise is building the hydro project and it is also providing a lot of jobs. As I understand it, they are to reticulate and sell the electricity produced at a much cheaper cost than has been provided anywhere else in Australia in the past. So exciting things are happening there. I also understand that the water distribution system in the Ord area is shortly to be privatised, with the farmers co-op taking on the distribution of water from the Ord Dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a lot of other exciting things about the Ord and the north-west that we were privileged to see. It is certainly a project that I think deserves the support of this parliament and of all parliamentarians. If the government could do its bit by clarifying the native title legislation, I think we would have a real asset to Australia's economic position in the north-west of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recess, I was also privileged, at the invitation of my colleague Mr Michael Ronaldson&mdash;the very well-regarded and, I am quite sure, long-term member for the electorate of Ballarat&mdash;to visit his area and talk to a number of small businesses in the Ballarat area. I want to highlight that there are industries around Australia which, in spite of this government's failures, are doing well through innovation, through good management and through good work practices. Everywhere I went in the recess&mdash;and I travelled quite widely&mdash;speaking to small businessmen the same thing came up time and time again: `Can you get the Labor Party to fix that unfair dismissals legislation? Can you get them to fix the industrial relations legislation? Can you get them to get off the backs of small business and to stop taxing us to death? If you do that, we don't want any assistance; we will go out and do it for Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst in Ballarat, I was very pleased to be taken to see what is happening at Miric Industries in Ballarat. It is a very innovative and forward looking company that was established some time ago by Mr Milton Schultz, a very energetic man with great vision and great foresight. It is now being run by his son, Mr Rick Schultz. It involves metal pressing, wire components, and plant manufacturing for the automotive, white goods, building and electronics industries. It is a very good company that has been in business for 20 years. It has a staff of 28 and a turnover of $2 million plus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently this company actually took on a new enterprise. The owner said, `Look, I don't want to be beholden to the international or multinational automotive companies all my life, I want to look at something that I can sell directly to the public.' He looked around. He had had some involvement with horseracing and he remembered that the farriers used to tell him that horseshoe nails were difficult to get, not of a good quality and expensive and supply was pretty erratic. So he decided to set up his own horseshoe nail factory within his business. As I recall what he told me&mdash;would you believe&mdash;only one other company in the world is doing this, an American company. This Australian company now exports to New Zealand, it exports to America, it has orders that it cannot fill, it is tremendously innovative and it already&mdash;it only started in January&mdash;has five additional workers employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a company with good management. This Australian went out and thought about it, thought about the market. He now produces these horseshoe nails, as I recall, 30 per cent cheaper than the American version, and of better quality. He does this, I might say, having to pay 30 per cent more for the steel he uses than the American company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this with some hesitation because no-one likes to criticise the big Australian: in this plant and a couple of others I went to during the recess, there was some criticism of BHP and the way this government organises things, that overseas countries could buy BHP steel cheaper than Australian companies. This horseshoe nail factory has to pay more for its Australian steel than its competitor in America pays. But it can still produce a better and cheaper product and is a great credit to Australian manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other place that I visited during the recess in my capacity as shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure was in Dubbo, at the request of my friend and colleague Mr Michael Cobb, the member for Parkes. He took me to a place called Fletcher International Exports, run by Mr Roger Fletcher and his wife. It is a tremendous plant, with over 500 people employed there. It is a mutton abattoir. They kill the sheep and export the mutton. They do not sell any of it in Australia, as I recall. All of it goes overseas. He has more markets than he can supply. He employs over 500 people and has a tremendous business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fletcher is a very interesting person. I think a lot of parliamentarians have met him. Again, he is one of those who do not want any help from governments, except for governments to get off his back and he will do the rest. Boy, oh, boy, if you look at his factory you can just see what he could do for Australia. He has a wool scourer and does fellmongering work. I am no expert on the wool and sheep industry, and that would be fairly obvious from what I say, but looking through that plant it is just tremendous the way he has set it up, the industrial relations he and his wife have organised with the people that work for them and the tremendous output and energy in that particular factory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has done a lot of things. I think he was proud to tell us he has no formal education. I think he said he used to be a drover. He now runs this international company that gets huge export dollars for Australia and does things that others have thought too difficult to do in Australia in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the fellmongering, he actually spins his own wool in a way that I understand is very, very new to Australia. He laments the fact that there is little or no tanning in Australia. He was telling us that his next project will be to use the sheep hides and have them tanned to make another fabulous new export industry for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That plant is an example, as is the one I saw in Ballarat, of what Australians can do. So whilst at times we lament and despair what is happening in this country, we certainly understand that the Labor Party has no interest in and understanding of people and the innovation and energy in small business. But they are just two that I did want to talk about, and the experience in the north-west, that show that in spite of the efforts of this government there are Australians that are innovative, that have the energy, that are getting on with the job of earning big export dollars and creating real employment for Australians. If only the government could understand from that what needs to be done with small business, our country would get out of its one million unemployment problem and its balance of payments problems and we would all be a lot, lot better off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about some issues that surround a proposal in Queensland to build a very large dam on the Dawson River near Taroom. If it is built at the particular place where at least one of the projections are for it to be built, it will be known as the Nathan dam. There is a lot of controversy surrounding this, and I do not come here today to necessarily put down what I think are the answers but certainly to raise the questions that are being raised by people in that area. The Australian Democrats have indicated for quite a long period of time their concerns about what is happening to the river systems of Australia. I noticed quite recently that the Leader of the National Party of Australia, Mr Tim Fischer, expressed his concern about this, and I can only agree with that part of what he said which was in the media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the invitation of some of the people in that area, I did visit Taroom in July and spent a little over a day there. I walked down to the bottom of the Nathan Gorge to one of the proposed sites for the dam wall and visited a number of properties which would be affected if the dam was built at that site. In the evening I attended a meeting in Taroom at which there were over 40 people present. This had resulted from a very limited invitation to those people from an organisation known as LAND, Landholders Affected by Nathan dam. I understand, however, that a meeting had been held a few weeks prior to that one, convened by the United Graziers Association and the Cattlemen's Union, and that attracted over 100 people. At both meetings a lot of concern and, I think, opposition was expressed to the building of the Nathan dam on the particular site which is being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns I have about this kind of development is the fact that it often divides people within communities, even divides communities one against the other and sometimes one group of land-holders against another group. In broad terms, I suppose, and in this instance, the people of Taroom who spoke to me are mostly graziers and agriculturalists. In some ways the dispute between them which could develop would be a dispute between their particular land use and the use of the land by, for example, rice growers further down the Dawson River and their need to irrigate their crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me a great tragedy that we have in Australia at times these kinds of disputes in which the very valid concerns of two groups of people seem to be unable to be reconciled, and you end up with one group of land users at loggerheads with another group of land users. The greater tragedy, however&mdash;and a very cynical exercise it would be&mdash;would be if government or bureaucrats sought to use the division between people as a way to push through either this development or any other development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the discussion about the particular project that I had heard earlier and prior to going to Taroom was that the land which would be inundated by siting the dam at this site was not agricultural land. I don't know how people got that information because certainly I visited and drove along river flats which were high quality black soil, suitable and being used at present for the growing of crops. These river flats would be, I understand, inundated if the particular dam was built. It seems rather short-sighted to me to project building a dam which would inundate good agricultural land so that we could thereby irrigate other agricultural land. There ought to be an alternative which would meet both needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taroom Shire Landcare Committee's submission on the impact of development options on Taroom Shire states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taroom Shire, at the head of the Valley&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Dawson Valley&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has much of the valley's best irrigable land&mdash;in fact 29,000 hectares above and below Taroom.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how much of the 29,000 hectares would be inundated, but some thousands of hectares have been mentioned. In fact, one of the figures which were quoted to me was that between 40,000 and 60,000 hectares of land could be inundated if the dam is built in the current preferred site. I find it hard to believe that the Taroom Shire, in particular, if it lost that amount of land through flooding, would gain from the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying question about land use, which is raised by the dam, is that the development of a large dam on the Dawson River would open up the area for more intensive farming through irrigation. It is thought that would increase the population of the area. There is no doubt that we certainly need to return people to the inland areas of Australia, I have no argument with that, but I wonder if those results would follow from building a large dam such as that proposed. The experience around the world is that large agricultural development of this kind is increasingly being done by international agribusiness corporations rather than by family farmers. It is a matter of debate, then, as to whether this kind of agricultural development is the kind that Australia or Queensland needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other possibilities for using the water from such a large dam is to supply new mining ventures in coal in the Wandoan area. I understand that Mount Isa Mines holds some leases over quite extensive coalfields, but there is a problem here as well. There is a debate going on, particularly in Mount Isa at the moment, about the increasing practice of mining companies, such as Mount Isa Mines, to service new mines by flying in employees from coastal cities rather than utilising local labour. This debate is certainly generating a lot of heat in Mount Isa. So one would have to wonder whether the building of a dam and supplying of water to open up mines in that area would, in fact, benefit the area locally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern which I have, of course, is the environment and there are many environmental issues raised by the building of large dams, particularly a large dam on the Dawson River at this site. The Taroom branch of the Wildlife Preservation Society has canvassed a lot of these in a submission it made to the Water Resources Commission, but just let me list them. I had never heard of bogamoss, or bogamosses, and I doubt whether many senators have either. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator O'Chee" NAMEID="EU4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee has. They are a mound spring that occurs in this particular area, and in other parts of Australia, but they are pretty rare. Although I had seen these in other parts of Australia, I had never heard them called bogamoss before. But that is what they are called in the Taroom area. Most of these are in the area which would be inundated if the Nathan dam was built on the projected site. So that certainly is a matter of great debate, and the debate surrounds the possibility that, associated with the bogamoss in that area, are some quite unique flora and fauna, some of which are already endangered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of transmission loss if water has to be transported over long distances, the problem of high chemical use in cotton growing and, apparently, an increase in seismic activity of between 5 and 10 per cent, which is associated with dams of this size. Most of the environmental problems would be minimised if any proposed water storage was confined within the present river bank levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in Taroom raised with me the fears that they have about compensation if the dam is built. It has been said to me that a number of land-holdings along the river have already been devalued because of rumours about the effect of the dam on properties. At the meeting which I attended, one person stated that she had been unable to borrow money from her bank to develop the property because it could be affected by the dam. It is valid to ask, because of the inevitable rumours which begin when such a project is on the drawing board, whether or not a process has begun which could result in increased land values for the areas to benefit from irrigation and decreased land values for the land which will be inundated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the implications of the Competition Policy Reform Bill, which we passed in this place some weeks ago. It seems to me that the debate is not just about appropriate sites for dams, water supply and end use. It is also a debate about who will ultimately control and profit from the building of a large dam and that is an even more important question. However, there are a number of alternatives and that is what impressed me. Those people I spoke to were not wanting to stop development in their area. They were not wanting simply to block the building of the dam. They understand that that country and most of Australia need more water and they were prepared to put forward a number of alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether these alternatives are viable but it is worth, I think, projecting that there are alternatives which ought to be looked at. These alternatives include: building a dam at the Baroondah site; building a much smaller dam in the Nathan Gorge but further downstream and including off-stream storage and weirs; or building further weirs on the Dawson River, but in sequence over a period of years so that the total cost would be incurred in manageable stages. The critical issue is that, whatever is built, it must deliver environmentally, socially and economically viable results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, let me say that one of the great concerns I have is that the water resources people, to date, have not responded to the Landholders Affected by Nathan Dam's `Response to the Dawson Valley Appraisal Study'. I believe that no further work should be done until that response is made and becomes part of the appropriate process of consultation with the people whose lives will be very deeply and significantly affected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon in the matter of public interest debate to once again express my very real concerns for the Tasmanian salmon industry and, of course, their employees. My concern is shared by the Liberal candidate for Lyons, Russell Anderson, the Liberal candidate for Franklin, Les Glover, and the Liberal candidate for Denison, Ingrid Wren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The salmon industry in my home state is a new, developing, and exciting industry. It has substantial potential for growth. Currently, 2,000 people are employed because of the existence of this industry, often in those parts of my home state that suffer from severe unemployment because of Labor's bias against the outlying regions of this country. Economically, the industry is vital to Tasmania, producing about $100 million worth of product each year. Socially, the industry is vital with the employment that it provides, especially in the regional areas. Environmentally, it is an industry which we ought be encouraging. On every count, the aquaculture industry is one we ought be fostering and promoting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the industry is being threatened with extinction by the threat of imports from North America. The threat is not from economic competition, but from the diseases that these imports carry and will, sooner or later, infect the Tasmanian fish farms. Such an infection of the Tasmanian fish would make their economic viability untenable. In short, the industry would be destroyed. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, or AQIS, provided a draft import risk analysis in recent times. I have previously expressed my concerns about that report, both in this place and in Senate estimates committees. In advising the Senate about my previous concerns, I also want to acknowledge the concerns expressed by my Tasmanian colleagues Senator Jocelyn Newman, Senator Paul Calvert and Senator John Watson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At great expense to it, the industry has now produced its response to the AQIS draft. It is a meaty document that runs into, I would assume, well in excess of 100 pages and has been very well prepared. It draws on a wealth of experience as set out in the page under the heading `Report Contributors'. There we have listed before us all manner of persons, with appropriate degrees and scientific qualifications that make them people well qualified to express the opinions that they have in that report. The bottom line of the report is that the risk of allowing importation of uncooked, wild-ocean caught, Pacific salmon from Canada and the United States is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a furphy put around that basically the salmon growers and the industry are against the importation of these products because of competition. Most Australians, chances are, would not be aware that in fact Australia already imports some $52 million worth of salmon product each year. The salmon growers do not oppose the importation of that particular product because it is either canned or cooked and comes in a form where the risk of disease is a lot less likely than what is currently being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS draft recommendations were not supported by the evidence. Indeed, where it does have a basis, it is on the basis of assumption and guesswork, hardly the stringent analysis one would expect from this government instrumentality. At this stage, I would like to quote from the report, at page 5, where the industry sets out in a summary form their concerns. The summary states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As explained in this submission, our industry competes strongly in local and overseas markets. Our product is regarded as the best in the world and attracts premium prices as a result of its unparalleled quality and freedom from disease and chemical residues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do fear, however, is the prospect that our competitive advantage in lucrative export markets&mdash;and therefore our economic viability&mdash;will be destroyed by the introduction of disease. Our product's reputation and the future of the industry are reliant on maintaining freedom from disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should AQIS's recommendations be approved, product entering the country from Canada and the United States will be sourced from stock which contains over 20 diseases not found in Australia. Should these diseases transfer to local stocks, commercial and recreational fisheries would be irreparably damaged, and native species put under threat. ABARE has concluded that the $100 million local salmonid industry would cease to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> AQIS acknowledges that exotic pathogens will enter the country and that the industry would be under major threat if these pathogens were to transfer to local stocks. What is not acknowledged is the likelihood&mdash;some would argue inevitability&mdash;that transfer will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Independent scientific analysis and numerous case studies highlight the likelihood and ease with which transfer can occur. By not properly evaluating the means through which disease could enter native fisheries once diseased fish enters that country AQIS is breaking with accepted international practice and putting our entire industry at risk.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, there are three basic issues. The first issue is whether exotic diseases will enter the country. AQIS and the industry agree that that will occur. The next issue is whether the disease pathogens will be transferred to local stock. That is the only place where there is disagreement between the industry and AQIS because, if transfer does occur, the industry will be devastated; that fact is acknowledged by ABARE and by the industry. The only area of disagreement between the industry and AQIS is in relation to the likelihood of the transfer of the disease pathogens into our local fish communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of research undertaken by AQIS in this area is, unfortunately, lacking. Allow me to give an example of one of the 20 diseases, known as PKD&mdash;proliferative kidney disease. This disease has been flagged as an example of a disease which should be kept out of Tasmania. It is interesting that the AQIS report identifies that the causative agent of this disease has not been isolated; the infective dose required to infect a fish is unknown; the physical resistance of the PKD agent is not known; the parasite's stability in sea water is not known; and the presence or otherwise of suitable hosts in Australia has not been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a disease-free status and premium prices being commanded as a result of that disease-free status, AQIS ought be approaching this on the basis of minimising risk. They ought minimise the risk, especially when there are substantial gaps in our collective knowledge as a scientific community in this important area and, in particular, with the disease involved. Despite the dearth of evidence, AQIS is apparently adopting a policy of `what you don't know won't hurt you'. I personally&mdash;and, I am sure, the industry in Tasmania&mdash;expect a much higher standard. Tasmanians, I am sure, expect a much higher standard of care from AQIS. The AQIS approach is apparently based on disproving risk rather than proving that there is no risk, and there is a significant difference. I recommend that approach to AQIS and its officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will quote an example which is contained in this report and which makes the point very well. The aquaculture industry does not, of course, have such a great community understanding as does, for example, the beef industry, and so this report asks the readers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consider the following scenario: it is proposed to import beef into Australia from a location that is known to have in excess of 20 cattle diseases not currently present in Australia. Many of these disease agents have the potential to wipe out the beef industry and will be present in the imported product. Some of these diseases are new, their method of transmission is unknown, the susceptibility of Australian cattle is unknown, the scientific knowledge is sketchy, and there is the possibility that the native mammal or marsupial populations could be wiped out if the diseases escaped into the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such product would be almost certain to be refused entry to Australia without processing at the source to eliminate the pathogens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This then raises the question&mdash;why is the salmon industry being treated differently?</PARA>
<PARA>That scenario highlights the difficulty that the industry in my state now faces and the double standards being applied in relation to this relatively small industry by Australian standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To support industry's claims that they are not opposed to North American imports for economic reasons, the Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association has very appropriately suggested a four-step program to deal with this matter and the suggestions that it makes are outlined on page 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore our strong contention that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In line with international practice, Canada and the United States should be required to institute processing methods which eliminate disease at source prior to export.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Improved requirements for heat treating imported product must be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Import regulations should be strictly enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.All product shipments need to be tested by AGAL at the exporters' expense.</PARA>
<PARA>AQIS's justification for allowing diseased product into this country is the assertion that the many diseases will not establish themselves in Australia. However, there is no scientific evidence to support such an assertion. Whilst there is no such evidence, our waterways, employees and producers ought be protected from the certain devastation that will ruin the livelihoods of 2,000 Tasmanians if the disease does take hold in fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the government has before it this fine report prepared by the industry in Tasmania, I trust the report will receive detailed yet speedy consideration so that the unnecessary dislocation and uncertainty being occasioned to the industry can be removed to thus allow the employees and the industry to get on with doing what they do best: providing high class, world standard, clean green product to our domestic markets and earning valuable export dollars to offset the outrageously high trade deficits we have experienced under the current Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I plead with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) to act quickly and to act appropriately. Remember that your duty is not to AQIS or to your bureaucracy, or, might I respectfully say, to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry), but to the people who work within the industry. I also plead with the minister to remember the very real importance this industry has to the people of Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of today's matter of public importance debate to speak on this very important report of the committee on Darwin. It is a 400-page report which was tabled in the Senate at the end of June this year. The committee was established by the federal government in 1993 to look at ways of making Darwin the nation's gateway to east Asia. Chaired by Labor mate Neville Wran, the committee was given $4 million of taxpayers' money and asked to investigate strategies to develop the potential of Darwin as Australia's northern link to east Asia. But, as the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Shane Stone, told the Legislative Assembly in Darwin last week, the committee subsequently lost the plot. Instead of looking at how Darwin could service the national interest, they took, to quote Mr Stone, `the benevolent but ultimately self-defeating view that the task was to identify ways to assist Australia's poor sister northern capital'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report now stands as a testimony to opportunities lost for Northern Australia, for this tired and unimaginative federal Labor government and for the taxpayers of this country who invested $4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee on Darwin was announced amid political fanfare and publicity by the then Treasurer, John Dawkins, in the 1993-94 federal budget. His vision for Darwin was reflected in his statement of 17 August 1993. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Darwin has the potential to become a major regional city, providing Australia's northern link to East Asia and acting as a catalyst and facilitator of increased trade with the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in Australia's interests that such potential is quickly realised, so that the nation can take full advantage of the emerging initiatives within the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process will require the Northern Territory economy to develop and expand from one based on mining, tourism and agriculture to one with larger industrial and commercial sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This in turn will provide a basis for population growth through new employment opportunities, enabling an expansion of the population of Darwin into an even more significant city over the coming decades. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my submission to the committee, I urged that committee to think laterally about the development of the north and suggested certain joint ventures between government and the private sector. Then, through the Senate estimates committees, I continued to monitor the progress of the committee by way of questions of various departments and officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report slipped into Parliament House on 29 June this year. I say `slipped in' because, unlike the fanfare that surrounded the original Dawkins announcement, the launch of the report was so subdued that members of the public were ringing my office asking where to find copies. The federal government's reaction was particularly telling. Despite the trade with Asia rhetoric we hear from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), he managed only a brief statement in response to the report. In fact, he stopped short of committing his government to a detailed response to the report, which ought to take place in this parliament. The report was then left to the Northern Territory senator and minister, Bob Collins. He rose to his feet in question time on 29 June, made some flippant remarks, and went on to table the document in what seemed an afterthought. Trade minister, Bob McMullan, has been mute on the report in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself contains 77 recommendations, estimated at $20 million over four years, and it must be said that their tone suggests political appeasement rather than political challenge. As one commentator said, the report bears the hallmarks of Treasury. The dissenting statements at the end of the report reveal frustration within the committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Geoff Stewart, the founder of North Flinders Mines, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that a more visionary, bold and imaginative approach towards the development of north Australia's vast trade and investment potential with East Asia is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA>Others, such as the Northern Territory political commentator Frank Alcorta were more blunt. Mr Alcorta said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is a disgraceful report which may linger like a bad odour to continue poisoning perceptions about Darwin and therefore the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>Sure, the report talks about the Northern Territory developing niche markets in tourism, health, education, training, research and medicine, but in many cases these have already been identified and pursued by the Northern Territory government. Sure, the report talks about the railway, the important link between Alice Springs and Darwin, being a case of when, not if, but why does it shy away from land bridging? Why does the committee underestimate the domestic freight content by 22 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one redeeming feature, then it rests with the 18 consultants' reports which were commissioned by the committee. They contain valuable research on subjects such as shipping, defence, long-term trends in east Asia and business leaders' perceptions of Darwin. I seek leave to incorporate a table listing these consultancies, which will be of interest to many organisations who will implement the consultants' recommendations that have been ignored by the Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. For some reason, the Wran report fails to reflect the quality of those consultancies. It is also fails to reflect John Dawkins's vision for Darwin. Why did the government and the committee lose the plot? My guess is that when the sponsor, John Dawkins, left federal parliament in 1994, the political will for this committee left with him. In other words, the government had an excuse to go cold on the project.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer, Minister, to your argument of convenience that Commonwealth funding of Dr Lawrence's effort to close down the Marks royal commission was contingent upon the Western Australian government not paying such costs. If that was the basis upon which you funded the Lawrence appeals, why did you not at the time of making that decision seek the financial support of the Western Australian government? Why did Mrs Lawrence's request to the Western Australian government for financial support refer only to her appearance before the commission? Haven't you, in fact, post facto invented this so-called contingent argument in an effort to disguise the improper decision of the Commonwealth cabinet in the first instance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proper course in these matters is for the person herself, in this instance Dr Lawrence, to make the application to the Western Australian government. I had assumed that that application had been made, both for the funding of her appearance before the commission and in any collateral appearances that may have been made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The government simply would like to protect Commonwealth taxpayers' interests by securing the paying of this so far as the Western Australian government is concerned. Absolutely nothing hangs on this particular question. They know perfectly well we do want them to pay for it. If there has not been a formal letter to that effect from Dr Lawrence to them, that is a matter that can very easily be remedied because nothing of any substance whatsoever holds on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of the matter is simply this: there is no problem whatsoever, legally or in terms of the propriety of the matter, for the Commonwealth paying the tab for this in the event that nobody else is prepared to do so. Obviously Dr Lawrence had to be in a position of knowing with some confidence that the tab would be picked up whether or not the Western Australian government was going to act in accordance with past practice and precedent, and it was on that basis that we addressed ourselves primarily to the question of how this particular amount was going to be paid, should it become necessary to do so.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successive Commonwealth Governments have provided financial assistance to Ministers in relation to legal proceedings. Prior to 1984 this was done on an ad hoc basis but guidelines were then put in place by the Labor Government to cover the most frequently occurring situations, ie where criminal or civil action is taken against a Minister in relation to some matter arising out of the performance of his or her ministerial duties. The Guidelines were not intended to exclude the provision of financial assistance to ministers in other situations, such as appearances before Inquiries and Royal Commissions, and do not purport to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Dr Lawrence's involvement in the Marks Royal Commission, consistent with practice and precedent, Cabinet agreed that it would be appropriate to financially support, to the extent necessary, her appearance before the Commission and any reasonable challenge she might make to the validity of its proceedings. Such costs will only be met should the Western Australian Government refuse to meet its own obligation to fund Dr Lawrence's costs&mdash;the funding of the costs of central witnesses before royal commissions being long-established practice at both State and federal level. There has been no definitive response from the Western Australian Government to this point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has taken the view that the most appropriate basis on which any Commonwealth payment might be made would be under paragraph 4(4)(b) of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990. Consistently with principle and past practice, the Government is not prepared to table any legal advices it may have received in the course of its consideration of this matter. However the Solicitor-General has been asked to provide a summary of his views on the relevant legal issues in order that the Government might publicly explain the basis on which it has acted. A copy of that summary is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to any payment which may be made for Dr Lawrence's legal costs, Cabinet has agreed that in accordance with long-standing and established practice, no payments would be made unless they were certified by the Australian Government Solicitor as fair and reasonable.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MEMORANDUM </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Bearing in mind sections 44 and 48 of the Constitution, I am asked briefly to summarise my conclusions as to the validity of the mechanisms proposed to make the payments with respect to legal expenses incurred by the Hon. Dr Carmen Lawrence, MP in connection with the current Western Australian Royal Commission into use of Executive Power (`the Marks Commission') in the event that the West Australian Government refuses to pay part or all of these expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, passed to clarify the law following the difficulties posed by section 48 of the Constitution exposed in Brown v West (1991) 69 CLR 195, makes specific provision in subsection 4(4) to cover payments other than mainstream salary and related benefits&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Payment of legal expenses pursuant to a separate appropriation line item made in reliance on paragraph 4(4)(a) would clearly constitute a benefit `under any other law' for the purposes of that paragraph. But the reasoning in Brown v West raises the possibility that payment out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance before that `other law' appropriation was actually enacted might not be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.To avoid this difficulty, and in order to enable payment to be made out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance for legal expenses as they are incurred (with that payment subsequently confirmed by formal appropriation), reliance may reasonably be had on the alternative source of legal authority in paragraph 4(4)(b) for the payment as a benefit `afforded by the Government to a Minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a Minister'. Given the public acknowledgement by those initiating and supporting the Marks Commission, as well as those opposing it, that the matters being inquired of are directed to the issue of Dr Lawrence's continuing fitness for public office as a Commonwealth minister, these matters are open to be regarded by Cabinet as directly relevant to her continuing to carry out her functions as a minister. This conclusion may be reinforced by particular reference to the mounted or foreshadowed legal challenges to the Commission based on Dr Lawrence's defence of the integrity of the institutions of parliamentary privilege and Cabinet confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The payment could separately be supported as a benefit under paragraph 4(4)(a) if it were made under the procedures of section 34A of the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.I do not believe there is any difficulty arising from section 44(v) of Constitution. As the Cabinet decision neither is based upon nor gives rise to any agreement, it cannot be said that Dr Lawrence has thereby any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One was with regard to wool tops, which will create a lot of jobs in Victoria, in which you would have thought some Victorian senators might be interested. The other was with regard to sugar harvesting equipment, which is very important in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two important value adding examples either add value to our raw materials or build on our commodity strength to sell manufactures beyond merely selling the commodities themselves. I am very pleased to inform the Senate that I have now received very encouraging advice indicating that the Mexican government just this week has taken action which, I expect, will result in the elimination of tariffs on Australian wool tops into Mexico and sugar harvesting equipment into Mexico in the very near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mexico is a very important market for wool, particularly with the special access it now has through NAFTA, and it was singled out by the industry council, in discussions with Senator Collins and myself, as a priority market for the development of wool exports. Up until now we have been successfully selling a lot of wool into Mexico&mdash;but in its raw state, not processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The processor in Mexico is about to close. If nothing had been done, the preferential access for wool top into Mexico would have gone to Uruguay, which had a free trade agreement with Mexico in this matter. As a result of our representations, I am confident that that tariff disadvantage will now disappear, the zero tariff will benefit and there will be a major boost to our wool industry, in particular the export of higher value added wool tops rather than greasy wool. It is about a $100 million market, so it is not something to be sneezed at. It is a big priority for our processing industry and a significant success for bilateral trade activities for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with regard to sugar harvesting equipment, there has been, as a result of NAFTA, a circumstance in which there was an advantage to United States suppliers compared with the Australian supplier. I refer in particular to Austoft of Bundaberg, but any Australian supplier would have been in the same position. They were the company which I was aware were seeking to export and which ran into difficulties compared with their American counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our representations, I am now quite confident that we will find that tariff also removed and that we will therefore be able to be a competitive supplier. It does not guarantee that we will win. We now have to have product and price, but the company is very optimistic that, if the 10 per cent differential can be taken away, it can win in the market and restore its continuing strength.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a significant victory for Australian manufacturing access to this important market. It also shows that in markets such as this&mdash;and we cannot sell sugar to Mexico, because it is a big producer&mdash;we do not have to stay away and say, `Shock, horror, this is a competitor.' We can go and supply our skills in manufacturing and our services in manufacturing&mdash;and the same applies in mining&mdash;and become strong suppliers in the value added manufacturing and services end of the market and create high-skill jobs for Australians in manufacturing and the provision of services. It is an indication of the success of bilateral trade strategy, building on our traditional priorities in multilateral and regional strategy. I realise the opposition continues to wish that we would fail and put out statements announcing that we have, but I regret to advise it that we have succeeded again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. Minister, are you aware that on Radio National this morning Mr Downer made some claims concerning your response to French nuclear tests in the Pacific. Is it true that an Australian company has made an offer to survey Mururoa Atoll for radioactive leakage free of charge and that you have declined to pass on this offer to the French government? If so, could you explain why?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that an Australian company by the name of World Geo-Science Corporation has made contact with my office with an offer to conduct flight surveys before and after a nuclear test at Mururoa, and also requested that I pass on the company's offer to the French government. The company proposed to conduct low-level flights over the test site and use its gamma rays spectrometer to detect changes to radiation levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the company offered to apply its technology free of charge, it did make clear that funding would be required for the charter of a plane or a helicopter if the flights were to take place. This morning Mr Downer seemed to think that the whole venture would be free of charge and that this was a sufficient reason for him to lend his support and go running off to the French government with the idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Downer should be aware that as part of the meeting of South Pacific environment ministers which the government convened in Brisbane last week I commissioned a report on the environmental impacts of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. I commissioned 20 Australian scientists from a wide range of disciplines to undertake the report. The report they produced, which I publicly released last week, is, I think, the most authoritative scientific assessment which has been undertaken since the Cousteau mission to Mururoa in 1987. The report concludes that the testing to date has already caused significant structural damage to Mururoa Atoll. Nothing is known about Fangataufa Atoll where some of the larger tests of more than 10 times the destructive power of Hiroshima have been carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as radioactive contamination is concerned, the report makes very clear that the effects will be felt in the longer term. Worst case scenarios put the possibility of radioactive leakage in the range of 20 to 50 years. Best case scenarios put it at over 700 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible to be more precise because of the refusal of the French government to allow access to the atolls and access to the scientific data that they hold. All the scientific evidence indicates that it is highly unlikely there would be a change in radiation levels as a consequence of a single test. It is also my view that it is highly unlikely that the French government would permit the necessary low level flights over the test site.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Kernot and other senators would know, the 12 hours proposals for allowing child-care assistance for occasional care users was a budget decision. It is a very fair presumption that budget decisions will be received and supported in the large part through this parliament. There are precedents, Senator, for not presuming that and I take your point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very concerned, though, to make sure that as many people as possible do have access to child care, and that was the reason for the introduction of the 12 hours proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>Those proposals will, on our estimates, allow 31,000 extra families to have access to child care&mdash;that would be for both occasional use and work related use. Given that there is still a significant unmet demand for work related child care, there is a concern that we make as much effort as possible to ensure our child care does meet the needs of working families while at the same time balancing some allowance for occasional care.

Since the last parliamentary session, several significant investment decisions have been announced in the automotive industry.

On the federal government side the concept car project has been launched, the 1994 state of the automotive industry report has been released and Senator Cook has led a delegation of Australian component producers to Asia on the back of the settlement of the US-Japan auto dispute. Can the minister inform the Senate more fully of those developments?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is good news for Australia and for the Australian economy because the investment we have attracted in the automotive sector, totalling over the last year or so in excess of $US2 billion, is a clear vote of confidence by international corporations in the strength of the Australian economy and the ability of Australians in the Australian automotive industry to be world competitive. Certainly, we ought to pay tribute to the way in which this industry has restructured itself to achieve that goal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of those investments as well, a number of major international companies&mdash;BMW, Mercedes Benz and Honda&mdash;and other companies too have decided to source major component suppliers for their cars on international production lines from Australia. So there is further a knock-on effect of the new competitiveness that this industry enjoys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest announcement, however, on investment came last Thursday&mdash;an announcement of $200 million for 1995 to 1997, reaching nearly half a billion dollars over the next five years to upgrade Holden's Engine Co. plant and to expand its capacity to export car engines from Australia. I must congratulate the Managing Director of the Holden's Engine Co., Mr Peter Thomas, and his work force. We worked with them over the last nine months in order to help them attract this investment. They won this investment in the General Motors Corporation against strong competition from other affiliates of that corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Holden's Engine Co. is the largest automotive export earner in Australia. This investment projects that it will increase its exports to $750 million a year and that, with the expansion that is anticipated, it could make a $170 million annual contribution to the trade account. On top of that, Ford Australia has announced a billion dollar investment in upgrading its plant in Australia for the next generation Ford Falcon. We have worked closely with the Ford Motor Co. starting July last year in Detroit and at international board level, working our way through, including during a visit to Australia by Mr Wayne Booker, the executive vice-president for international automotive operations at Ford worldwide. They have voted confidently in Australia's capacity to be a supplier in this market with a billion dollar investment. In attracting this billion dollar investment, the Prime Minister played, I believe, quite a decisive role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The investment commitment will give a strong boost also to local component part suppliers. The Ford Motor Co. is the biggest market for Australian owned component part suppliers, and we estimate that, since they take 27 per cent from Australia, the investment will be worth $4 billion to the component part sector alone. On top of that, an American corporation has located itself in Australia and invested $165 million in Australia to use its Australian production facilities as an export base for Asia and, in particular, for India and for the immediate ASEAN area. They see that Australia is a very competitive site for this investment and the best place to locate major investment for their corporation in this part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have locked Australia into the global strategies of the major car producers in the world, and we have done so through policies under this government&mdash;the export facilitation scheme being one of them&mdash;and our ability to find ways of improving the micro economy and of improving workplace efficiency in this industry.

The object of the exercise from start to finish has been to discredit Dr Lawrence and try to establish her unfitness to hold that particular office.

The reason they are lower is because people clear their stock in June for the end-of-year clearance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, at the time that the government decided to fund the action, to fund Lawrence in her efforts to bring the royal commission to a close in order that she would not have to appear before it, there was no intention whatsoever on the government's part to seek that the Western Australian government pay for that; it was done in order that they might support their minister and to save her embarrassment, and it was to be done at the expense of the Australian taxpayer, a decision&mdash;</PARA>

That is the basis of the argument of convenience that the minister tried to put in the Senate yesterday&mdash;to suggest that all along it had been the government's intention to first seek the Western Australian government to pay for this. That was not its intention at all. It was a convenient afterthought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could get to the real truth of the matter&mdash;and all the truth&mdash;if the government had put on the table the documents that the Senate had sought by order, but the government refused to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that ought to be explored by that inquiry is this obscure argument of the government as to its basis, its entitlement, to be funding Dr Lawrence in this matter. In the documents incorporated by Senator Evans in question time today its argument appears to rely on section 4(4) of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. That does not provide any basis for payment at all. Subsection 4(4)(b) states:</PARA>

<PARA>No-one could suggest that that subsection provides the power that empowers the government. But even if the government was right&mdash;and it is an obscure interpretation, if I might say so, at best&mdash;it is still in trouble because there is no way that it could suggest that these payments to Dr Lawrence to close down the royal commission can be `benefits paid by the government to the minister for the purpose of carrying out her functions as a minister'. There is no way in which you could argue that her efforts to close down the royal commission can in any way further her responsibility as a Commonwealth health minister. Even if the interpretation that is being sought to be applied was correct, the government certainly falls at that hurdle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The correct and most appropriate body to explore the detail of not only the legal questions involved but also the motivation of the government is the Senate committee process. That is why we are seeking to set up this inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That cannot possibly be right because the particular action before the Supreme Court was not commenced until nine days after this particular press statement was issued. The action taken in the Supreme Court was commenced on 29 June. You are talking about an exchange which occurred on 20 June. Until then there was nothing to request of the Western Australian government because it was just purely proceeding in general terms. The more specific request came along later, as you would expect. It came along, in fact, on 4 August, when a very detailed, I am advised, seven-page application was made&mdash;not just a two-paragraph letter from Dr Lawrence&mdash;by her legal advisers arguing the case for indemnity, both for all proceedings before the commission and for a fully detailed account of all the proceedings that went on before the Supreme Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, there is no question but that the Commonwealth has never been prepared to sign blank cheques on this particular matter. We are only going to cover the costs of anything, as I said, that is not otherwise covered for Dr Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second business from Senator Hill, the truth of the matter is again extremely straightforward: 4(4)(b) of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act is the general cover for payments of the kind that are proposed to be made in this instance, just as the act as a whole provides cover in all its various different provisions for all the various different classes of payment, regular and ad hoc, that might be made from time to time to parliamentarians and ministers. There needs to be statutory cover for this because the case of Brown v. West a year or so before this act was passed made clear that unless there was statutory support for any payments made, there may be some problems with section 48 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that there has to be further explicit action taken to support a particular appropriation, and the point about 4(4)(b) is only that it provides the general legal authority for a payment of this kind to be made. Any particular dollars that have been made obviously have to be supported through the normal appropriation system. The difference is that with 4(4)(b) you can support, on the legal advice available to us, an advance payment under the Advance to the Minister for Finance. There may be a trouble under any other head of power, certainly as articulated in this act, in doing that, in making a payment under the advance, unless you rely on 4(4)(b). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can rely specifically on 4(4)(b) because  what is clearly involved here is Dr Lawrence's capacity to continue carrying out her functions as a minister. I will read into the record again the relevant advice from the Solicitor-General, who makes the point clear:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the public acknowledgment by those initiating and supporting the Marks Commission, as well as those opposing it, that the matters being inquired of are directed to the issue of Dr Lawrence's continuing fitness for public office as a Commonwealth minister, these matters are open to be regarded by Cabinet as directly relevant to her continuing to carry out her functions as a minister. This conclusion may be reinforced by particular reference to the mounted or foreshadowed legal challenges to the Commission based on Dr Lawrence's defence of the integrity of the institutions of parliamentary privilege and Cabinet confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA>There in a nutshell is the basis of that particular argument. There is no doubt about the legality of this payment, if it has to be made. There is no doubt about the propriety of it. The only matter of issue so far as propriety is concerned here is the propriety of a witch-hunt being mounted at massive cost to the taxpayers by the Western Australian government in utterly unprecedented circumstances. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to address this matter and comment particularly on the stunt that has been pulled by the government and Dr Lawrence in the application for funding, or putting the onus on the Western Australian government. I say that purely and simply because Dr Lawrence is aware, as is the government, that the guidelines used to deal with this royal commission are exactly the same as the guidelines that were put down in the Western Australian parliament in 1990 by the then Attorney-General in the Lawrence government&mdash;and I have a copy of them here with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this original letter that Dr Lawrence sent, which Senator Hill had in the parliament today, she was fully aware of those guidelines. She did not make application at that time for an action to be taken as to whether or not the royal commission should be allowed to continue. That was a separate matter open to any citizen to do through their own resources whether they be a minister or otherwise. It is an absolute and total misrepresentation of the facts and a total nonsense to now throw this red herring into the equation that there is something sinister about the Western Australian government not funding her appeal to the Supreme Court and the High Court. Of course, it is now obvious from the government preparing their tactics that they were quite aware that a number of Labor mates were going to dump on the ex-Labor mate. That now consists of eight plus three staffers who have come out with a totally different recollection from that put forward by Dr Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is that when Carmen Lawrence put forward her original application&mdash;which is being dealt with by the Crown Solicitor or the Solicitor-General in Western Australia  at this moment&mdash;those guidelines had been in operation since 1990. They were put in place by the Lawrence government and when this petition was tabled she was operating under those guidelines with the full knowledge of what those guidelines contained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government now comes in with a different proposal in terms of applying for funding. But this proposal does not represent what was available at the previous royal commission. That is a very important point to remember when we are debating this particular issue. Dr Lawrence is trying to obtain a privileged position which is not available to anybody else on the question of whether or not a royal commission should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make is that at that time those guidelines were restricted to ministers of the crown, staffers and public servants. That meant that Joe Blow who came in off the street and wanted to give evidence could not get assistance. That has created a problem now for one John Halden. He cannot get assistance under the guidelines put down at that time by the Lawrence government. It is worth taking that into account when dealing with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is saying that Dr Lawrence should have a privileged position in terms of what she can get as against what John Halden can get. It is totally hypocritical of the government to adopt that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This commission is concerned with establishing the state of knowledge of the Premier of Western Australia at that time&mdash;Carmen Lawrence&mdash;in relation to the tabling of that petition. I believe it is acknowledged on all sides of this parliament, and in Western Australia, that that petition was misleading, dishonest and incorrect. It was a petition which led some days later to the suicide of Penny Easton. It cannot be easily brushed aside as a political stunt or a political exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely fundamentally important in the parliaments of this nation&mdash;whether at federal, state or local government level&mdash;that the information and the data put on the table represents the facts and the truth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this royal commission is all about. It is an evidentiary exercise that is designed to test the credibility of a minister that is presently serving in this government. The purpose of attacking her credibility is not to rectify what happened two or three years ago. The purpose of attacking her credibility is to make her a less efficient minister in this government and perhaps make her fall as a minister from this government. This exercise is about the capacity of Dr Lawrence to serve as a minister in this government.

This minister has been put in the position of having to finance her defence in this unique exercise of having an evidentiary and forensic instrument used against her to impugn her credibility&mdash;that is, a particular type of examination where people make a statement and then get somebody else to make a statement to contradict that statement.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsibility for the expenditure of public funds associated with the Marks Royal Commission rests squarely with the Court Government in Western Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Opposition's use of the guidelines for ministerial legal costs in this matter is a red herring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to 1983, there were no guidelines. The guidelines now apply only to ministers defending legal proceedings. They do not apply to inquiries or to court action initiated by ministers. These continue to be assessed on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the Marks Royal Commission is clearly aimed at casting doubt on the fitness of Dr Carmen Lawrence to be a Commonwealth Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The calling of the inquiry is also an attack on the fundamental principles of Parliamentary privilege and representative democracy, in that it asserts executive authority over actions inherent in the performance of the duties of a Member of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Western Australian Government, having called the Royal Commission, has a responsibility to meet her costs including the seeking of a determination in the courts on the legality of the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it fails to do so, the Commonwealth has a duty to ensure Dr Lawrence is able to seek a determination on its legality as well as to put its own views before the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the Federal Opposition to attack the Commonwealth's support of Dr Lawrence is the ultimate in hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have cheered on the Court Government's blatant abuse of taxpayer funds in pursuing political agendas, first in the futile challenge to the native title legislation which it admits cost at least $4 million, and this inquiry conservatively costed at $1.4 million.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank of Australia is usually cautious in what it says in these reports. Certainly it does not seek to alienate itself from the general economic position taken by the government and does not seek to embarrass the government. Nonetheless, this report reveals real concerns about the inflationary threat facing Australia and, by clear inference, the government's handling of our present economy. I can demonstrate that in a few moments by reading some sections of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the government has mishandled the economic recovery to the stage now where the Reserve Bank is pointing to inflationary risks facing the economy. It makes the point at one stage that one of the problems facing Australia is the massive current account deficit. The fact is that, under this government, this nation not only is massively indebted&mdash;it has the worst balance of payments situation, I think, of all the Western developed countries&mdash;but also is going into debt at the rate of something like $2 billion a month because of an incompetent government economic policy. The government is not bringing about the basic changes required in Australia to stop us going into debt. This has some disastrous consequences, and the bank points them out. For example, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While . . . yields rose in most countries during 1994, the rise in Australia was relatively large by international standards, suggesting some Australia-specific concerns to the markets&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the key point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was no coincidence that countries with poor long-term records on inflation, or with large fiscal or current account deficits, tended to record the largest increases in bond yields.</PARA>
<PARA>We score on every ground. We have an appalling long-term inflation record under this government&mdash;sure, they got it down by having a massive recession. We are under inflationary risk at the moment; we have had huge deficits; and now we have got a massive current account deficit, which keeps getting worse and worse despite the fact that we have gone through a recession which should have held up or reversed the level of internal demand that would have brought about those sorts of imports or would have caused this sort of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a situation where the government's basic policy failure makes us one of the worst in the world and having a specific problem that, as the Reserve Bank says, other countries do not have. What is the situation facing Australia? According to the Reserve Bank:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With business costs&mdash;labour, raw materials, intermediate inputs, and imported products&mdash;all rising faster, it would be surprising if prices to the consumer, measured in underlying terms, did not also pick up more quickly over the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA>That's a great forecast, a great prospect we have&mdash;rising prices coming on top of the big increases in KST, that is Keating's sales tax, we got on 1 July, bringing about more than a 50 per cent increase in the sales tax bill Australians have to pay. There has been a 46 per cent increase since the last election in the level of sales tax that has to be paid on motor vehicles. That means that every motor vehicle owner in Australia faces a massive increase in price, probably between $1,000 and $3,000, when they replace their motor vehicles, because of this government's increased tax. As the Reserve Bank says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These pressures could be heightened by the impact of indirect tax measures&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>by this government. But this is the government that said at the last election that consumption taxes were a disgrace and that you should not have them. It won the last election by attacking consumption taxes. Yet here the Reserve Bank says that these inflationary pressures could be heightened by the impact of indirect tax measures. Whose are they? They are Paul Keating's. They are KST&mdash;the Keating sales tax. It is the sales tax you have when you are not having a consumption tax, apparently. It just happens to be worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been huge rises in petrol tax, a 46 per cent increase since the last election and in Keating's sales tax a 50 per cent increase. These and all those other little Keating taxes, these consumption taxes you are not supposed to have according to Keating, now account for something like $30,000 million a year. The GST that Keating said you should not have would have cost something like $20,000 million. It is unbelievable&mdash;50 per cent more than the GST would have been. On top of that, there has been a 50 per cent increase in KST, Keating sales tax, collections over the short period of less than two and a half years since the March 1993 election in which the Labor government lied its way back into power. The Reserve Bank goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Long-term security yields, although now well below their recent peaks, still appear to anticipate inflation rates above recent outcomes . . . From this perspective, the main concerns for policy in 1994-95 were twofold. One was to avoid the cyclical pick-up in labour costs gathering too much momentum and prejudicing our long-term inflation performance. A second concern was that a lower exchange rate, if sustained, could exacerbate domestic inflationary pressures, adding to the difficulty of recovering the situation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the situation brought about by this government's incompetent economic policies. The Reserve Bank then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both these concerns remain at the present time . . . The round of cost increases, presently going through the economy, however, is likely to push underlying inflation above 3 per cent over the year ahead. For that to be temporary, there can be no further pick-up in the growth of labour and staff costs, and the more subdued growth path now being followed will need to be reflected in some moderation in wage and salary claims over the coming year . . . The recent low levels of the exchange rate, were they to continue, would clearly be unhelpful from an inflation perspective. The prospect of domestic price and cost pressures easing as the economy slows helps to make that situation tolerable for a time, as does the partial recovery in the exchange rate during July. Even so, movements in cost pressures, and in the exchange rate, will obviously warrant careful monitoring over the year ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Reserve Bankese for saying that we are seriously at risk and that we have to watch this very closely. We are by no means out of the woods. </PARA>

There is no doubt that the Reserve Bank's comment that we can expect at best a rate of growth of around three per cent or so is not enough to reduce unemployment in the future, on the government's own indication and statements. Whatever the government does, it has now painted itself into an economic corner that worries the Reserve Bank. It ought to worry the rest of Australia. It does not worry this government because, frankly, this government apparently does not care about people who are suffering as a result of these economic policies and who are having to suffer higher real interest rates than they ought to because of this government's economic policies.

In this debate there is a danger that those immune to the injury racial hatred can beget will give too little weight to the harm it inflicts on those who are not. There is a risk that people of good will, anxious to preserve the best of society and, in particular, its commitment to free speech, will prejudice the welfare of men, women and children cruelly and unjustly attacked because of their race, colour, nationality or ethnic origin.

It is comfortable living in the mainstream which desists from attacking itself. To come to the point, Senator Panizza made an eloquent and, I found, moving plea on behalf of all ethnic groups when he asked that we as a nation should empathise with all people no matter what their background, and understand that some, even today, must suffer wounds inflicted by racism.

In assessing the need for this bill, we are duty bound to give proper weight to the problems people amongst us face because of their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. For example, with what moral force can a white Australian admonish a black one who has been racially abused on the football field to leave the injustice so inflicted inside the fence? Michael Long, universally acknowledged as a great and brilliant footballer, has in recent times made public the racism directed against him. Many decent men and women thought that he ought bear the slurs cast upon him as part of the give and take of sporting life. He disagreed, and more and more people are turning to his point of view.

This bill makes criminal certain types of threats. It provides civil remedies for people who suffer damage because of certain racial acts. It provides neither criminal nor civil remedies against people who engage in discussions, debates, arguments, lectures, conversations, plays, comments, asides or jokes.

They object to criminal sanctions even when these are less stringent than the penalties in some states prohibiting threats without racial connotations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways, it is a debate juxtaposing individual rights and the collective good.

In this climate, it is imperative that the community, however defined, sets up clear guidelines and standards for human behaviour separate from the all-pervasive individualistic competition model. We must seek to establish some balancing standards of collective behaviour based on cooperation and tolerance. </PARA>

This was documented by the national inquiry into racist violence by Irene Moss and Ron Castan, which lists and describes 1,447 cases of racist violence and intimidation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the legislation. The government's bill amends the Crimes Act 1914 to create offences based on racial hatred. These include: prohibitions of threats to cause physical harm because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin; threats to property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin and in some cases religion; and incitement of racial hatred because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of a person or a group of persons. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent, the crimes are already covered to varying degrees by statutory offences in state legislation, but this bill fills in gaps, consolidates the law and adds the racial focus. The amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 are analogous to provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. One of the provisions which has raised some concern is the declaration that the act of being offensive and insulting should be unlawful. However, it matches the terminology of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and the most common means of resolving disputes under this section is through conciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to the issue of free speech. We rightly treasure free speech as one of the essential safeguards of our democratic system and an important element of the right to have a voice in government decisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle of free speech is now an implied constitutional right and an essential element of our democratic society. We are rightly jealous of it and must protect it against governments, powerful interests and indeed anyone who would wish to silence critics and the voices of those who have opposing views. If public debate is to fulfil its essential function in a pluralist society, this freedom of expression must also be preserved for those who hold views which we find abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the racial vilification debate, this essentially correct argument, however, has been used like a club as an absolute, self-evident truth and a more than sufficient reason to reject the bill. However, it is clearly a case of one public policy principle&mdash;namely, free speech&mdash;being circumscribed to achieve other competing public policy objectives which are judged important enough to limit the freedom of expression. Examples are the laws relating to defamation, copyright, obscenity, sedition, contempt of court and incitement to violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arises whether the need to protect people from insults, harassment and worse because of their present or former nationality, creed, skin colour or religion is such a competing policy objective. Surely it is the mark of any civilised society to offer protection to the potential victims rather than to the perpetrators of racist hate propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other countries in Europe, New Zealand and some states in the United States, as well as New South Wales and Western Australia, have taken that step.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">British historian Sir Alan Bullock, while displaying his Eurocentric mindset by ignoring the unresolved and traumatic relationship with the prior owners of the continent, said, on his recent visit, that Australia's most significant postwar achievement was the successful creation of a multicultural society which could serve as an example to the rest of the world. It is an achievement worth protecting also in John Rawls's terms, who measures the level of a society's social justice by the degree to which that society protects its weakest members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is tightly drawn to confine the limits to free speech to intentional and public threats of personal violence or property damage and public incitement to racial hatred which is intentional and likely to succeed. The answer to critics of these provisions must surely be that it is difficult to see why we should safeguard the rights of potential perpetrators of such acts rather than the right of potential victims to be protected against such attacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection against public statements reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person is, as I have said before, in similar terms to the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and is carefully hedged to protect public debate and artistic expression. Statements which offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person are not criminal offences. However, any person aggrieved by such a statement may lodge a complaint with the Human Rights Commission. The commission will hear both sides and will determine any action which needs to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Free speech advocates conveniently overlook the exemptions in this bill, for a complaint will not succeed if the statements were made: reasonably and in good faith; in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work; in making a statement, publishing something, discussing or debating for any genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or `any other genuine purpose in the public interest'; in the course of publishing a fair and accurate report of any event or matter of public interest; or in making a fair comment on any event if the comment is an expression of a genuine belief by the person making the comment. It seems that those who delight in racist jokes or jeers on radio, in films and in the theatre will still be able to do so if this bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the most muddled thinking has centred on the criminal sanctions which apply to threats of violence, property damage and incitement to racial hatred. Little account has been taken of the fact that the two and one year prison terms respectively are the upper limit of the punishment a court could determine&mdash;and, obviously, it would only apply these terms in the most extreme cases. In its discretion the court could use a shorter term, a fine, community service or no punishment at all. People who object to the possibility of a prison term for racially motivated threats should also be made aware that the terms for, say, threats to damage property, where those threats are not racially motivated, are five years in Victoria and New South Wales and seven years in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should ask the question which has been asked by many a critic: will the legislation stop racist attitudes or behaviour? No, of course not. It would be foolhardy to expect this. If passed, the race hatred legislation will be first of all a statement by the Australian parliament that there is some behaviour which is not acceptable in our community. Such standard setting is important as part of the glue which our diverse community needs to achieve the security and social cohesion which is the basis of tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specifically, it is protection from racially motivated harassment that no member of our society should be denied.

Many&mdash;perhaps most&mdash;of the new arrivals to Australia over the past 12 years would not know these facts.

That brings me to the Keating government's Racial Hatred Bill 1994. The coalition has consistently believed and argued that the basic cause of racism is ignorance and that education to shape community attitudes is the only approach that will produce long-term, lasting results. That is because education attacks the causes of racism rather than the symptoms. </PARA>

In other words, the government's strategy is to give priority to attacking the symptoms of racist attitudes rather than the causes. </PARA>

It was widely reported that the bill only narrowly received cabinet approval, and I have not seen that report refuted. Nor did the bill have an easy passage through the Labor caucus. Caucus chairman, Jim Snow, broke ranks and went public saying that he opposed the bill because Australia is a tolerant society&mdash;and becoming more tolerant&mdash;and that `if you don't need legislation then its better not to have it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government minister, Gary Johns, opposed it for similar reasons. So did the Labor member for Kalgoorlie, Graeme Campbell. Even more significant, perhaps, was the opposition from former senior ministers in the Hawke and Keating governments and former senators John Button and Peter Walsh. Former Leader of the Government in the Senate, John Button, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I worry about the need for it, and whether, in fact, it may not be counterproductive. The most worrying thing about racial vilification (legislation) is the arguments of those in favour of it.</PARA>
<PARA>Former finance minister Peter Walsh went further. He wrote, before the bill was introduced, `The whole idea should be thrown out.' But of course the Racial Hatred Bill has many other critics. Indeed, I can think of few bills that have attracted as widespread criticism as this bill. One respected commentator, Mr B.A. Santamaria, has even been moved to describe it as `one of the worst pieces of legislation ever put up in this country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not be surprised that the bill has attracted the strong criticism it has. In the course of its consultative process during the preparation of the bill, the Attorney-General's Department received no less that 646 submissions. Interestingly, and revealingly, the department omitted to consult with several major community organisations. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 646 submissions, 563 were opposed to racial vilification legislation. Only 83&mdash;that is, less than 15 per cent&mdash;were in support of the legislation. Of the 563 opposed, the three largest reasons given, according to the Attorney-General's Department, were that `it restricts freedom of speech'&mdash;209 submissions; `too often well intentioned legislation causes as much mischief and division as it does good, it promotes racism'&mdash;47 submissions; and it is `undemocratic, un-Australian'&mdash;42 submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 83 in support, the only two reasons that attracted double figures were that `the legislation can stop racism, religious bigotry, which is the cause of most problems'&mdash;47 submissions; and it `protects against jokes at the expense of some members of the community'&mdash;12 submissions. It is highly questionable whether the bill would do either of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has met with a very mixed response from people and organisations of non-English speaking background.

The coalition shares this view. We believe that multiculturalism can only flourish where basic rights and liberties, and, in particular, freedom of speech are enshrined. To have otherwise is ultimately to undermine multiculturalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the criticisms voiced by representatives of Australians of overseas origin, grave concerns have also been expressed by many other leading figures and respected commentators in the Australian community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have today deliberately quoted extensively the views of many Australians to reflect their feelings about the Racial Hatred Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by repeating what I said at the outset of my remarks today. The Liberal-National coalition yields to no person, to no organisation, in the intensity of our abhorrence of any form of racism, any racist actions or attitudes in our tolerant, multicultural society. We all have a responsibility, a fundamental duty to one another, to do all we can to stamp out racism wherever it may appear, in ways consistent with the maintenance, preservation, and strengthening of the basic values and institutions that are the cornerstone of making our society and our way of life the envy of virtually all other peoples and all other nations on earth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a great honour to follow the speech delivered by my friend and colleague Senator Short on the Racial Hatred Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My starting point is a speech that was delivered by a black man on a sweltering summer's day in Washington DC in the 1960s, a man called Martin Luther King, who gave a speech which went down in history, a speech in which he said, `I have a dream.' He went on to outline that dream in terms that one day a man would be judged not by the colour of his skin but by the quality of his character. They are mighty words. He said something else, which is also important. He ended his speech with the words `Let freedom ring'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Martin Luther King, racial equality was a necessary condition to achieve a greater purpose, and the greater purpose was to deliver true freedom to the people of the United States of America. We should think not just of the words `I have a dream'; we should think too of the words `Let freedom ring'. We should ask ourselves, `Is it the appropriate way in this country, at the end of this century, to achieve racial harmony by constraining freedom under the tyranny of unnecessary law?', and that is the question at issue here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me, I say unequivocally that attempting to force people into racial harmony will never achieve the purpose that it sets out to attain. It runs the grave risk that, instead of uniting people, legislation such as that which is before the Senate today will divide them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does legislation divide people in this fashion? Legislation such as this divides people because it encourages them to think of themselves in particular terms. It encourages people to define themselves and to define others by virtue of their race, their distinguishing characteristics, instead of defining themselves and others by their nationality and equality before the law&mdash;things which, in our constitutional system, are not distinguishing characteristics but unifying characteristics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great strength of our country is this: that I was born in this country in 1965 before the Holt coalition government abolished the White Australia Policy, that my grandfather moved my family to this country permanently in the 1930s, and yet I can stand here the equal of any honourable senator in this place and as a representative of my state, irrespective of racial origin. That is the strength of this nation. That is the great quality which we must preserve, and all of that has been achieved without this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia was a racist country, if Queensland was a racist state, then I would not be standing before honourable senators here today. I am living proof that this country is one of the most tolerant nations on earth, and I give this warning: we meddle with that basic tolerance at our peril. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now let me address some of the detailed issues raised by this bill so that not just those in this Senate chamber here today but those listening and those who will subsequently read this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will understand clearly why I join my coalition colleagues proudly in opposition to the thrust of the provisions of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn first of all to the criminal sanctions because I believe it is a grave threat to society that people are allowed to make racist threats against other people's property or against their person. I believe that is a danger to the whole harmonious base of this nation, but it is such a grave threat that this government only accords it in this legislation a maximum 12-month gaol penalty. Senator Spindler, who spoke before me, pointed out that to make the same threat in the state of Queensland, my home state, without having to prove a racist cause, can earn somebody a maximum seven-year gaol penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the seriousness with which this government views that punitive crime, and it is an absurdity to say that a gaol sentence for racist threats against property, which is one-seventh the gaol sentence for threats against property without a racist motivation, is proof of this government's intent to stamp out racism. What it is, is proof that this government decided it would embark upon this course of legislation to try to score votes, but it could not even unify its own people behind some decent penalty system. There are many better ways in which to deal with the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A racist threat against a person, or a racist threat against a person's property, is quite rightly a greater wrong than a simple threat without that motivation. A threat which involves race is an aggravating factor and in my mind ought to be treated at sentence as an aggravating factor. But you do not create some sort of second-class crime to deal with issues of race and say that it is proof that the government is intent on stamping out racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great problems as far as I am concerned with this legislation is the attitude of paternalism that says certain people are almost like endangered species&mdash;they need to be locked up in special legislation. Well, I find that offensive. I find it offensive that I might be categorised as somebody who needs special legislation, and for the benefit of honourable senators on the other side, I can assure them that I am not an endangered species, but what I can assure them is that the underlying philosophy of this legislation, which is the underlying philosophy of the politically correct, is an endangered philosophical species, an endangered philosophical concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not interesting that elsewhere around the world where political correctness bloomed into the social and political landscape some time before it reached our shores, people are already saying it is time to eradicate and eliminate political correctness and instead move onto a different vista, a vista which encompasses a society that can look at itself and its neighbours without having to have legislation to tell it how to think. You see, I believe that the true mark of maturity in a society is when the society itself is willing to accept different members with different qualities and characteristics and accept that they are equal without having been told to think that they are equal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot tell people what they must and must not think, and harder still is the concept of telling people what they must and must not feel because I think sometimes people feel things without even thinking them. You will never stamp that out with legislation. You will never end these things by saying, `We're going to pass a law.' Senator Spindler, whom I know to be for very honest reasons a solid proponent of this legislation, himself admitted today that this legislation will not stamp out racism. My grave concern is that this legislation, instead of narrowing the gap between Australians of different ethnic backgrounds, widens the gap because it encourages people to look on others as different instead of looking on them as equal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this from my own experience. One of my very good friends is Basil Tambanis, who I think is half Greek and half Yugoslav. He and I rib each other mercilessly, but at the end of the day we have in common one thing: that we accept each other into something which is uniquely Australian. We accept each other into the bond of mateship. As an Australian, nothing can be higher, nothing can be more privileged than to share mateship with a fellow Australian, and we can achieve this without legislation telling us that that is how we have to think or how we have to feel, but it does require a maturity of character to judge people by their behaviour, by their values, by their principles and by their fundamental worth rather than judging them on whether they should be accorded particular consideration because of the colour of their skin. That is the flaw of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I find it extraordinary that this legislation is going to create a situation where people can take other people to court because they are offended by something they happen to say. I was brought up to believe that one of the reasons we fought the Second World War was to fight Nazism and tyranny, and Nazism and tyranny were based in part on telling people how to think. I remember being in primary school and being told that there were people who said of others that they disagreed with what others had to say but that they would fight and die to defend their right to say it. Yet here we have legislation which, instead of defending the right of people to say things, allows people to take others to court because they do not like what somebody has said. It is a big bad world outside these doors, and it is not always fair and it is not always kind, but the measure of a man or a woman's character, the quality of them themselves, is their ability to tolerate that with which they do not agree because they recognise that tolerance builds a stronger community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation says to Australians outside who have struggled for decade after decade after decade to achieve that tolerance that it was all in vain because we can sort it out by taking people to court.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal abhorrence of racism grew out of my experiences as a child living in Fiji. I witnessed racist behaviour, discrimination and prejudice towards Fijian and Indian people; and it angered me. These views were reinforced when I briefly visited South Africa and experienced apartheid first hand. Seeing people being told which public toilet or park bench they could use, based on the colour of their skin, left a disturbing and deep impression upon me. Like most Australians, I have grown comfortable with the perception of Australians as fair minded and egalitarian, and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inquiries have consistently concluded that Aboriginal and ethnic Australians experience discrimination, threats and actual physical violence as part of their everyday life in this country. In considering this bill, senators must be mindful that, as predominantly white middle class Anglo-Saxon males, we have a different perspective from that of the victims of racist behaviour. How many of us have been subjected to abuse in the streets, damage to our home or businesses, or campaigns exhorting our banishment or murder simply because of our race, colour or national or ethnic origin? The victims of extreme racism look to the federal parliament for leadership and action that will assist them to live as freely from this sort of behaviour as you or I. I believe the parliament has an obligation to provide that protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Racial Hatred Bill fills the gap in uncoordinated state and federal law and seeks to protect our citizens from harassment, threats and the incitement of racial hatred, which leads inevitably to violence. It incorporates a substantial public input into the government's 1992 bill and overcomes problems identified with the New South Wales legislation. It adds to the Racial Discrimination Act by further defining what kinds of extreme public racist conduct are not acceptable to our community. It does this in two ways. Firstly, it creates three criminal offences by amending the Crimes Act. Secondly, it establishes a civil prohibition against racial harassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first two criminal offences prohibit threats against people and property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. However, criminality now attracts where the basis of the threat is race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Perhaps even more significantly, it affords protection where there is no single person threatened, but a group of people identifiable by their race. Incitement law currently requires one person to convince another to commit a specific crime. If a murder should follow a racist leader exhorting followers, say, to get Asians, the leader would not be criminally culpable. Likewise, defamation laws protect individuals, but not groups, from defamatory lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third offence dealing with incitement of racial hatred has generated the most vigorous community debate, primarily because of its perceived impact on free speech. This provision prohibits public acts done with the intention of inciting, and which are likely to incite, racial hatred. It seeks to properly protect our citizens and society from the undeniable harm that is done when people set out publicly and intentionally to persuade others that a certain group is deserving of hatred, harassment, discrimination, threats and violence. It targets intentional, extreme public acts which are likely to cause harm or hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government expects that the criminal provisions contained in this bill will rarely be used. They deal only with extreme racist behaviour. As with all Commonwealth human rights legislation, the major emphasis is on conciliation of complaints by way of amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act which provide for a civil prohibition against racial harassment. These provisions enable a victim to complain to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission about public behaviour that is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate an individual or group on the basis of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Broad exemptions to these provisions ensure that ideas and discussions can flow freely and without restriction in matters of public interest. Debate in good faith about sensitive issues will not be stifled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's civil provisions reflect the successful formula used to deal with sexual harassment in the 1983 Sex Discrimination Act. At that time the parliament recognised that harassment, as a particularly damaging form of discrimination, required specific legislative provisions. No-one has yet explained to me why the parliament should protect people from sexual harassment but not racial harassment. As with domestic violence and sexual assault law, this bill recognises that existing general criminal law is inadequate to deal with this important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of criminal and civil provisions provides a comprehensive foundation to deal with extreme racism within the community. Like the Racial Discrimination Act this bill does not seek to eliminate racism, nor could it. A law alone cannot change what people think. What the law can change, however, is public behaviour, behaviour which is well along the continuum towards actual violence, which causes a person to suffer discrimination and harms our society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is overwhelming international and local evidence of growing racial intolerance and of the need for appropriate and measured legislative responses. Neo-Nazi activity is rising in affluent western Europe. What is perhaps more frightening is the political success of unabashedly racist movements such as Le Pen's National Front in France, the fascists in Italy, the Liberal Democrats in Russia and the British National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of the Australian Neo-Nazi movement has seen violent racist demonstrations against Asians and Jewish peoples and held in a number of our state capitals. In my own state of Western Australia, the Australian Nationalist Movement waged a war of bombing and terror against our local Asian communities. Three major Australian reports on racism starkly document incidents of racial harassment and violence in our society. The Australian Law Reform Commission report into multiculturalism and the law, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the 1992 national inquiry into racist violence all found abundant examples of racially motivated private property damage, destruction of religious or cultural symbols, physical and verbal assaults, and public harassment and humiliation. The desecration of Eddie Mabo's grave and Jewish graves and the exposure of the Loyal Guardians reinforce those studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extreme racism is not confined to fringe groups or to the ill-educated. Surveys of university students show that racism is alive and well among our educated elite. It pervades our sporting codes and racial bullying and violence have recently been reported at one of Perth's most exclusive private schools. Thousands of racially motivated acts of violence and harassment occur every year in Australia. Racism is not under control but, rather, it is on the increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations has recognised its responsibility to respond to the growth in racism by declaring 1995 the Year of Tolerance. It has urged information, legislation and education to combat the resurgence of racism and intolerance. Australia has yet to fulfil its obligations contingent upon its international treaty obligations. Both the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights commit Australia to action beyond that already contained in the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is currently popular to deride international treaty obligations, I believe it is important that we honour those commitments made on behalf of Australia. Passage of this bill would rectify that inadequacy in relation to racial hostility and racial violence. There are those who argue that this legislation is not necessary or that in enacting the bill we will be paying too high a price. Central to the arguments of those opposing the bill is the proposition that it would impose an intolerable restriction on free speech. Free speech is a fundamental tenet of democracy. Any proposed restriction on it draws appropriately vigorous debate in our community. But free speech has never been unfettered or absolute. As Lionel Murphy declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Free speech is only what is left after due weight has been accorded to the laws relating to defamation, blasphemy, copyright, sedition, obscenity, use of insulting words, official secrecy, contempt of court and Parliament, incitement and censorship.</PARA>
<PARA>No-one in this debate is suggesting any repeal of these speech crimes. We accept restrictions on free speech because of the potentially harmful link between words and actions. We accept restrictions on free speech where the proximity of the words to harm or damage is such that victims are entitled to expect protection. We balance the rights of the speaker and the rights of the victim. In the recent political advertising decision, two High Court justices noted the restrictions on free speech are justified only if they do not exceed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what is reasonably necessary for the preservation of an orderly and democratic society, or for the protection or vindication of the legitimate claims of individuals to live peacefully and with dignity in such a society.</PARA>
<PARA>This, in my view, is such a case! Public speech with the intent of inciting racial hatred is not just an expression of opinion or ideas. It is dangerous conduct that is designed to intimidate, frighten, harass and discriminate. It creates the environment in which more active and extreme forms of racism thrive. It undermines the very cohesion and tolerance we rely on as a largely successful multicultural society. It potentially escalates violence in that all members of a group identifying with a victim share the sense of injustice, fear and possible desire for revenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To protect this form of speech over the right to live free from fear, harassment, discrimination and violence, I believe misunderstands the whole doctrine of free speech. Surely the intentional promotion of racial hatred is as damaging to society as a misleading prospectus or video pirating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could extreme racism be tackled without restricting free speech, the government would have done so. However, without words, racism cannot exist; without words, racist ideas and objectives cannot be formulated; and, without words, ideology condoning discrimination and violence against certain groups cannot gain supporters and activists. That being the case, the point along the continuum at which that speech becomes sufficiently damaging and harmful to warrant civil or criminal action must be determined. This bill establishes that point on the continuum and strikes the appropriate balance between the right to free speech and the right to be protected from racial hatred and its consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some opponents of the bill, and in particular those who oppose the criminal provisions, argue that an education campaign be pursued as the sole alternative strategy. That education confronts racist attitudes is self-evident, and I am the first to support the extension of education programs that promote tolerance. However, those who support education without legislative backing give insufficient weight to law as the ultimate educative tool. Legislation is a powerful statement of public policy and defines community values that have evolved through public debate and discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this case, we are declaring as a community that behaviour promoting or causing racial hatred, harassment or violence will not be tolerated. The legislative expression of these values influences behaviour and, in time, attitudes. Like Senator O'Chee, I turn to the words of Martin Luther King but I think this quote is slightly more pertinent. Mr King said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Morality cannot be legislated, but behaviour can be regulated. Judicial decrees may not change the heart, but they restrain the heartless.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr King also points out that most citizens are deterred from acting unlawfully unless there is some pressing reason to do otherwise. Of course, attitudes are affected by legislation. The Sex Discrimination Act is a good example of federal legislation affecting community attitudes. Whilst the SDA could never have eliminated sexism, I challenge anyone to suggest that it has not been a significant force in the considerable changes that have occurred in our society's attitude toward women and their role in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill gives force and framework to the education process regarding racial hatred in Australia. However, it does not represent a particularly radical legislative measure. The New South Wales Greiner government introduced the first Australian racial hatred legislation six years ago, with the unanimous support of that state parliament. Together with the ACT, Queensland and WA, all now have some form of criminal racial hatred laws. With the exception of WA, all of these jurisdictions also have civil provisions. This bill complements and adds to the relevant state laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Numerous countries have banned racial hatred and violence for many years. These laws have sustained through conservative periods of rule in Canada, New Zealand, Germany, Great Britain and some states in the United States of America. Despite protestations to the contrary, there is no evidence of a proliferation of free speech martyrs in any of these jurisdictions. Neither has there been any reports or evidence of laws being used as a weapon in inter-ethnic conflict. In three years of debate, no such examples have been proffered. Not one of the extreme racists currently in gaol in Australia, like Jack Van Tongeren, have become any class of martyr in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not know quite what to make of the attitudes of the opposition parties. The history of their about-turns and contradictions on this issue is too complicated to recount. In March coalition inaction had become so embarrassing that John Fahey told ABC radio that Liberal turmoil over the bill reflected the party's deeper divisions. Never a truer word was said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Vanstone earlier today made a valiant attempt to put a constructive face on this Liberal Party turmoil. But, on every piece of social legislation debated in this parliament&mdash;be it native title law or this Racial Hatred Bill&mdash;the deep divisions between the liberals and the conservatives that constitute the Liberal Party have been exposed. It is ironic that Liberals in this place are always demanding government members withdraw words used in debate that they find unacceptable. They are sensitive to verbal abuse. Why will they not recognise the sensitivity of those subjected to far more hurtful and far more dangerous language?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, I do not think those opposite are serious about confronting racial hatred. Even Senator Vanstone, who has unsuccessfully sought to reconcile the extreme views that exist within the coalition, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe, if you want to express those deep seated feelings, even if it is hatred, and you want to encourage others to agree with you, you should be allowed to.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, we are in fundamental disagreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a couple of remarks about the position of the Greens. I understand the strong views Senator Chamarette has about imprisonment as a solution for inappropriate behaviour and have some sympathy for her view. To her I would make three points. Firstly, imprisonment is the punishment of last resort and the bill incorporates many other more effective and less severe means of punishment. Secondly, the success or otherwise of rehabilitating aberrant behaviour is only one consideration in our criminal justice system. Equally important is the protection of individuals and the community and the deterrent function of the law. If you accept the link between racial hatred and violence, you must accept that, in extreme cases, the victims need protection from perpetrators. Thirdly, the overwhelming focus of the bill is in the civil sanctions, which I believe the Greens support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> My support for this bill is not motivated by any attempt to be more self-righteous than the opposition, nor by a pitch for the so-called ethnic vote. But it is true that I have listened to those subject to racist attacks in our community. Ethnic Australia has strongly supported the government bill as the appropriate response to this growing problem. They do so because the government consulted fully with ethnic and racial groups and listened to what they had to say in drafting this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The importance of the victims' perspective was vividly reinforced for me at a meeting of the Chung Wah Young Professionals Group in Perth, which I attended&mdash;together with Daryl Williams, the member for Tangney&mdash;to debate this bill. A distressing number of group members related their personal experiences of racist behaviour. For them, racism and incitement to racial hatred were not nebulous concepts but painful, frightening and degrading personal experiences which are all too common. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Dr Eric Tan, a highly respected Western Australian and leader of the local Chinese community, offered compelling evidence of what will continue to be the case should this parliament forgo its responsibilities and fail to legislate in this matter. Dr Tan led the Chinese community during the years when the Australian Nationalist Movement terrorised the local Asian community in Perth. Dr Tan expressed his frustration at being unable to get the police to take seriously the threats and expressions of racial hatred espoused by that repugnant group. The police were unable to intervene in the ANM's activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chinese community felt isolated and abandoned as these racists spread their hate throughout Perth. Only when the ANM had progressed to firebombing of Asian restaurants and murder, thus committing offences against the then WA Criminal Code, were authorities able to effectively deal with the organisation. If this legislation had been in place, effective action could have been taken before the ANM progressed along that path to violence and murder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That debate, the comments from the audience, and discussion with people afterwards, strongly reinforced my support for this legislation. All the education programs money can buy would not have protected those citizens from the ANM; nor would any amount of counselling have deterred the ANM from their destructive path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I strongly urge all senators to support this important legislation. What better, more effective means do we as a parliament have to communicate our abhorrence of racism in all its forms.

<PARA>That was the Liberal stance 50 years ago. It remains the stance today. Labor has&mdash;as did Senator Chris Evans in his contribution that has just gone before&mdash;sought to rewrite history by portraying the Labor Party as the party of promoting tolerance. History will tell us otherwise. Let me give a few examples. A former Labor Premier of New South Wales, a man the Prime Minister idolises, Jack Lang, was a well-known anti-semite and supporter of the White Australia policy. A former leader of Senator Evans's party, Arthur Calwell, had a number of things to say, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japanese women should not be allowed to pollute our shores.</PARA>
<PARA>That was leader of the Australian Labor Party. In 1972 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australians are ever foolish enough to open their gates in a significant way to people other than Europeans, they will soon find themselves fighting desperately to stop the nation being flooded by hordes of non-integratables.</PARA>
<PARA>Just before he died in 1973 Arthur Calwell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No red-blooded Australian wants to see a chocolate coloured Australia in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA>What a proud tradition the Australian Labor Party has! But that deals with a past generation of Labor Party politicians. What about the present generation? Nobody encapsulates that better than the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who said in his maiden speech on 17 March 1970:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time we considered the enormous cost of bringing migrants to this country. . . After all, the best migrant is the infant Australian.</PARA>
<PARA>How is that supposed to make people like Senator McKiernan, Senator Spindler and me feel? What sort of attitude does that develop amongst the Australian born to migrants? I ask the rhetorical question: what sentiment does that develop towards migrants such as the Prime Minister's own wife? The callousness and harshness of the Prime Minister's comments will never be undone without a full recantation by the Prime Minister. His arrogance will unfortunately deny him this honourable course. If we need another classic example of Labor's attitude we need look no further than the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who undoubtedly is off to address another League of Rights meeting shortly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contradistinction, the Liberal Party has a proud record in the area of racial tolerance. We believe that the way to deal with people's prejudice and ignorance is through education. It is ignorance that provides fertile ground for racism. As Mr Wakim, Secretary of the Australian Arabic Council, told the legal and constitutional legislation committee dealing with the Racial Hatred Bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thrust of what we really want to inject into this discourse is not so much about the legislation, but to try and have a look at the roots of the problem rather than the symptoms, and have a look at how we can redress the ignorance that is a fertile ground for the racism in the first place, and we can redress the gap between the victim and the law, rather than the gap within the law.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why the coalition has proposed a $10 million fund for a multipronged education package. Because of my ongoing interest in this area I asked during estimates hearings what amount of money the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission had spent on public awareness programs in trying to fight manifestations of racism. The answer for the year 1993-94 was the princely sum of $123,000&mdash;the government is spending a lot more money on the defence of Dr Carmen Lawrence&mdash;hardly the sort of financial allocation one would expect from a government allegedly genuinely committed to the elimination of racial hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that my contribution to this point has set out in no uncertain terms the coalition's commitment to genuine racial tolerance and opposition to those who preach their poison of racial hatred and also our rejection of Labor's duplicity on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the specifics of the bill. The bill proposes the establishment of three new crimes. Firstly, there is the prohibition of threats to cause physical harm because of race, colour, national or ethnic origin; secondly, prohibition of threats to property because of race, colour, national or ethnic origin; and, thirdly, prohibition of incitement of racial hatred because of race, colour, national or ethnic origin. The head of power for the establishment of these new crimes is the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criminal law has traditionally been the province of the states. The activities proposed to be outlawed by the first two crimes are already crimes in every state and territory of the Commonwealth and, might I add, they do it a lot better. During hearings by the legal and constitutional affairs committee I asked the following question in relation to the first two crimes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you accept that all types of behaviour, irrespective of motivation, are already covered by criminal law in every single state and territory of the Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Jackson, Deputy Government Counsel, Civil Law, Attorney-Generals' Department, responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, that is true.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat the point that the proposed legislation will mean that there will be a lesser penalty if the crime is committed and prosecuted pursuant to these proposed new sections of the Crimes Act than if they were prosecuted under existing state legislation. Mr Pearce, of the Civil Liberties Council, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But let me make this point about it . . . under section 198 of the Crimes Act in Victoria, for example, for the threat to damage property the penalty is 10 years. Under this legislation it is two years. Under this legislation you get time off for being a racist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, the educational value of such an anomaly is in direct contrast to what the bill seeks to effect. This indicates that the legislation has not been thought out in the manner that it should have been. In fact, what has occurred is that under close scrutiny this legislation is now embarrassing Labor. It is noteworthy that Mr Pearce is from the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties, hardly an organisation committed to the promotion of racist ideals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very strongly of the view that the way to deal with racists who commit crimes is to treat them as the common criminals they are. As Ms Wallace, also from the Council of Civil Liberties, said very succinctly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some 30 years ago, we had chronic domestic violence. We still do, but we have decided in the interim that defining domestic violence as violence, and prosecuting the people who perpetrate the violence on members of their family, that has made the difference. Not treating them as having a particular kind of violence, but treating them as ordinary perpetrators.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And if there are levels of racial ignorance, you have a fertile ground for the growth of racism. We must address community ignorance about race, and about victims, and we must do it with a budget and with a knowledge that a budget has to be commensurate with the difficulty of the task in front of us.</PARA>
<PARA>We have committed $10 million to that fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In creating a separate crime, we run the risk of making political martyrs out of common criminals. Let us never forget that the extremists from all types of causes will go to gaol to make a statement. In my home state of Tasmania, the Greens are very well known for doing exactly that. I have no doubt that racists will also try the same tactic, especially in relation to proposed section 60, which deals with the third crime that is to be created. From that section, I believe that political martyrs may be born if prosecutions are raised. This provision will turn the expression of a view into a crime even if no threat or act of violence is perpetrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with John Stuart Mill when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can never be sure that the opinion we endeavour to stifle is a false opinion, and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still.</PARA>
<PARA>The worldwide experience of this type of legislation has shown it to be a dismal failure, commencing in a country where, if it had been effective, one of the greatest tragedies ever inflicted upon humankind by humankind should have been avoided. I refer to the holocaust. Mr Borovoy says at page 50 of his book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">When freedoms collide: the case for our civil liberties</EMPHASIS>, which was published in 1988, the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remarkably, pre-Hitler Germany had laws very much like the Canadian anti-hate law. Moreover, those laws were enforced with some vigour. During the 15 years before Hitler came to power, there were more than 200 prosecutions based on anti-semitic speech.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As subsequent history so painfully testifies, this type of legislation proved ineffectual on the one occasion when there was a real argument for it. Indeed, there is some indication that the Nazis of pre-Hitler Germany shrewdly exploited the criminal trials, in order to increase the size of their constituency. They used the trials as platforms to propagate their message.</PARA>
<PARA>Now, 60 years later, with the aid of mass communication, the platforms provided by such trials to propagate racist messages would be all the greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me add as an aside that this book by Mr Borovoy draws on journals such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jewish Social Studies </EMPHASIS>and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Contemporary Jewish Record</EMPHASIS>, the latter of which details that Joseph Goebbels was sentenced twice&mdash;once to three weeks and once to six weeks in prison&mdash;for insulting a Jewish deputy police commissioner of Berlin. The rest is, of course, a very shameful chapter of human history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Journal of Human Rights </EMPHASIS>written by Anne Twomey is entitled `Laws against incitement to racial hatred in the United Kingdom'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every time there is a review of these laws, the allegation is made that they are not achieving their functions, and should be amended. Although the problems are easy to identify, the solutions have been elusive and the Westminster Parliament is still struggling to find the best approach.</PARA>
<PARA>She concludes at page 248 with this further observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience in the United Kingdom has again shown that many of the most notorious racists are capable of avoiding conviction under such legislation, and that it is often members of minority groups who do not have the same access to legal advice who are caught by the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the aim of racial vilification legislation is to set out community standards of behaviour, then it may well achieve this objective. However, one might wonder whether there are other less coercive means of achieving the same results.</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse Anne Twomey's perceptive observations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has unfortunately drawn division within the ethnic communities and has also been misunderstood by the very top people in the ethnic communities. For those who might be interested, on 17 February 1995, at page 289 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, Mr Rebikoff, the president of FECCA, the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia, said this to the committee:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we turn to the civil sanctions that this bill provides, it is noteworthy that Mr Peter Bailey, in his evidence to our committee, suggested that proposed section 60 ought to be removed from the criminal area and put into the civil area to overcome a whole host of problems, including the constitutionality of it, given the inherent right to freedom of speech discovered by the High Court in recent times. Mr Bailey's evidence was based on his background as a former human rights commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition criticism of the civil sanctions is based on its broad framework. The legislation deals with such terms as `offend' and `insult'. Mr Pearce said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dealing first of all with the civil side, essentially the effect of that legislation will be to protect people from hurt feelings. The legislation is designed specifically, and in terms, to protect people from offence and insults.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No other legislation or principle of law that we are aware of in this country, has that effect. No other legislation or principle of the law that we are aware of seeks to protect people from hurt feelings. We say the government has no role as the guardian of hurt feelings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We say that no case has been made out to give the government that role, and we say further that no case has been made out to why hurt feelings from racial abuse, as opposed to any of the many other forms of abuse to which people are subjected on a daily basis, ought to be singled out for special protection.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very easy to foresee a situation where people can be offended, insulted or humiliated on the basis of the colour of their hair or their lack of hair; their size, be it height, such as tall or short, or their width, be they thin or not so slim; if they wear glasses; or whether they have a large nose or chin; or on the clothes they wear. The range of possibilities is quite endless. I support the view of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties in relation to this legislation going way over the top. The implications have not been thought out in a mature and sustained manner. With the current minister, we would not expect it to be considered in such a manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does provide defences if it is done in `good faith' or on a `scientific', `artistic' or `reasonable public interest' basis.

The balance between these two rights is the central component of the provisions of this bill. Put simply, the bill provides for separate civil and criminal remedies for offences motivated by racism. It amends the Racial Discrimination Act to allow individuals or groups who have been victims of racist or discriminative behaviour which is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate to pursue civil actions against the perpetrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also amends the Crimes Act to make a criminal offence of threatening violence against a person or group on the basis of race, or publicly inciting others to racial hatred or contempt. These carry a maximum sentence of two years and one year's imprisonment respectively. Threats to property based on racism are also punishable by one year's imprisonment. I would stress that the terms of imprisonment are the maximum sentences and that other penalties are available of a lesser type&mdash;penalties such as fines, bonds and community service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will deal with the civil offences. This first provision which allows civil proceedings against perpetrators of racist behaviour will close a gap in the existing racial discrimination law. This gap was identified by the National Inquiry into Racist Violence and the royal commission into black deaths in custody. Legal redress will be made available to individuals or groups who are victims of a public act that&mdash;to quote the bill&mdash;is likely to `offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate' on the basis of race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This civil remedy is very similar to remedies available in the existing sexual harassment legislation, which has already been passed by the parliament and is well endorsed and supported by the Australian community at large. It allows a civil action to be taken by persons or groups who are victimised, intimidated or harassed without actually being physically assaulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some argument put forward that this legislation will have the effect of unjustifiably restricting private expressions of opinion or that it will be used to protect against offended sensibilities. This is not the case. The bill will only operate where the conduct complained of will adversely affect the quality of life and wellbeing of the groups affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear distinction here between simply entertaining a racist attitude and inflicting hurt and suffering on another on the basis of their race. It is my view, and that of other Labor senators, that the right to free speech is not harmed by this limitation to prevent intimidation of other Australians on racist grounds. I will now proceed to deal with the criminal offences set out in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second set of provisions in this bill is the criminal sanctions, which make it a crime to threaten racist violence against people or property or to incite others to racial hatred. It is these provisions which have come under the most public attack from coalition members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence found that, whilst state and territory criminal law punishes the perpetrators of violent racism, it does not adequately deal with conduct that leads to this violence. The report documented 60 incidents of incitement to racial violence which were not subject to existing criminal sanction. The legislation makes it a crime to threaten to cause physical harm because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, punishable by two years imprisonment. It also provides a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment for threats to property on the same basis, as well as a one year penalty for intentional incitement of others to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions explicitly exclude acts carried out in private provided that they are not communicated to the public or done in, or within view of, a public place. Reactionary groups in Australia, as well as some members of the National Party, have been claiming that this legislation would detrimentally infringe upon the private actions of individuals and that the government is legislating to prevent people thinking particular thoughts or reading particular literature in their own homes. This is obviously incorrect and is based on an intentional misunderstanding of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section of the bill is very narrowly focused. It does not prevent the public expression of racist views per se, nor does it prevent organisations from circulating racist material, except where it amounts to inciting racial hatred. The only activity that is restricted as being criminal by the bill is the public expression of violent threats and the incitement to racial hatred. Simply using particular words will not be subject to criminal action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Racial Hatred Bill has been subject to extensive public comment and scrutiny over the past few months. The principles of this bill reflect a wide canvassing of public opinion and have received widespread support from many new Australians and their respective representative groups. These include the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils, the Ethnic Coalition, the Australian Chinese Community Association of New South Wales, the Northern Metropolitan Migrant Resources Centre of New South Wales and the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arguments raised against its implementation have included that it limits free speech and artistic expression, that it is unnecessary and that technical difficulties arise from the Brandy case. I will address a number of these concerns. The principal argument raised against this provision has been the right to free speech. It is claimed by various groups that the right to free speech includes the right to encourage others to commit racist violence or to threaten individuals or groups with racist violence. This is, frankly, ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few Australians would argue the right to free speech should be absolute. We all accept there must be laws limiting free speech on issues which are likely to cause harm to the fabric of our society and innocent members of the community. Current laws preventing the dissemination of child pornography or libellous allegations are a case in point. These laws recognise the need to legislate where free expression can cause serious damage to members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to freedom of speech does not arise in Australia from a bill of rights or any particular legislation. It is based on implied rights associated with the Commonwealth constitution and our common law tradition which were articulated in the recent High Court decisions of Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v. The Commonwealth, and Nationwide News Pty Ltd v. Wills and subsequently reaffirmed in the cases of Theophanous v. Herald and Weekly Times and Stephens v. Western Australian Newspaper Ltd, which specifically related to the laws of defamation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the High Court's twin judgments of Australian Capital Television v. The Commonwealth, and Nationwide News Pty Ltd v. Wills, a majority of the court recognised a constitutional implication of freedom of political discussion. This derives from the principle of representative democracy which forms part of the Commonwealth constitution. Mr Justice Brennan described this right as `inherent in the idea of representative democracy' and went on to conclude:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where a representative democracy is constitutionally entrenched, it carries with it those legal incidents which are essential to the effective makings of that form of government. Once it is recognised that a representative democracy is constitutionally prescribed, the freedom of discussion which is essential to sustain it is as firmly entrenched in the Constitution as a system of government which the Constitution expressly ordains.</PARA>
<PARA>In recognising the right of freedom of speech, the High Court also recognised that it was and should be limited in the interests of the common good. In fact, an extract from those cases was referred to in Senator Cooney's address. In order to determine when such a situation may arise, the court prescribed that a balancing process must be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill, the right to free speech has been balanced against the right to live free from fear of violence and harassment. It places no new limits on public debate of ideas or artistic expression, nor does it affect private conversations. Nothing that is said or done in good faith in the course of any public or private debate will be affected by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar legislation has been in force in New South Wales for the past five years and there is no evidence to suggest that New South Wales has become the police state that some would fear with the passing of this legislation. It could, in fact, be argued that the boundaries of this bill could be considerably widened without inhibiting free speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us does not affect the public expression of racist views, as long as these views do not incite racial hatred or violently threaten groups or individuals. It is my belief, however, that the public expression of non-violent racist views is also deeply offensive to most Australians. Nonetheless, the only avenue of expression that is curtailed by this bill is the expression of extreme threats of violence on racial grounds, and the public incitement to others to commit such acts of racist violence. Given this very narrow focus, there can be no genuine argument that free speech is in fact restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fischer in the other chamber argued that this type of legislation was unnecessary because of Australia's record of racial harmony. It is true that in the large majority of cases different ethnic groups in Australia live in harmony, but there are exceptions to this rule and there is still a need for the protection that this bill affords. Page 299 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of national inquiry into racist violence 1991 </EMPHASIS>states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence presented to the inquiry indicated that some people are deliberately inciting racial hostility and, particularly in the case of racist graffiti and poster campaigns, getting away with it.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth of this observation was highlighted recently when the ACT opposition leader had cause to lodge a racial vilification complaint based on unsolicited mail from the Citizens Electoral Council. This mail links Aboriginal land claims with terrorism and claims that the emergence of an `Aboriginal identity will lead to a terrorist upsurge, precisely as they created the Shining Path of Peru'. Further, Mr Fischer has claimed that this legislation is a waste of time and that the government should deal with more important matters. In fact, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill quite simply should not be before this House&mdash;not tonight, not tomorrow, not in the future&mdash;in this form or in any form . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The widespread support for this bill indicates that his opinion is not widely shared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators have also raised the possibility that the application of this bill would limit artistic expression. Indeed, this has been a major focus of the opposition's attack on the bill, although it is not a view that I have heard expressed within the wider community. Artistic expression is specifically exempt from the effect of the bill. It would have to be a rather strange form of art that would seriously incite racist violence, in any case, which should put this fear to rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has claimed that the bill will prevent comedians from telling racist jokes. Senator Abetz, in particular, claimed that shows like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wogarama</EMPHASIS> would be affected by the passage of this bill. This claim is completely incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the legislation. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wogarama</EMPHASIS> comedians base many of their jokes and parodies on stereotypes of a particular ethnic community. They do not incite their audience to commit racial violence against that community. They do not encourage their audience to develop an attitude of hatred, contempt or severe ridicule of that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators Ellison and Abetz claimed before the Senate legal and constitutional committee that the existing law covers any criminal case that might be brought under the provisions of the Racial Hatred Bill and that, therefore, this bill is redundant. While I would agree that there may be some situations where the existing law currently applies, it does not cover all situations, particularly those relating to incitement to racial hatred. It is my view that there is an important educative and deterrent role in having this legislation enacted. This legislation sends a clear and direct message to those individuals and groups in our society that do encourage acts of violent racism that this government is serious in seeing these activities stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Racism must be fought at the grassroots levels through educational campaigns and by publicity&mdash;and the government has indicated its support for this option as well. By openly confronting and dispelling racist claims, this bill is also playing its part. The opposition has belatedly indicated support for anti-racist education programs, and I welcome that. But legislation also plays its part and it indicates the strength of the government's commitment. If the laws that arise from this Racial Hatred Bill are never utilised, they will still have helped to spread the message that public, verbally violent racism will be strongly opposed by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our reputation as a multicultural nation that will not tolerate racism and racist violence is a very proud one. Extreme racism and racist violence are infrequent and, despite the great diversity of the Australian population, we have an excellent record in maintaining racial harmony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not designed to engineer an end to all racist attitudes. No piece of legislation will&mdash;not in itself. But the opinions that are expressed in this bill target particular behaviour which threatens racist violence against the person, group or property and it provides a means of redress to those who have become victims of such violent acts. For this reason, this bill must receive the support of the Senate, and I commend it to senators. </PARA>

Indeed, I did that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was with this in mind that I approached today's debate on the Racial Hatred Bill dealing with racism in the community. Australia is indeed a free society. I believe it to be one of the freest societies in the world today. I also believe that Australia is free of a good many evils that exist overseas&mdash;evils such as political and religious intolerance and widespread racism. That does not mean, however, that we are not vigilant against those problems, against those cancers in a society. But let us approach this debate on the rational foundation that we are starting from a position where we have a society which is in fairly good shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at legislation of this sort we then ask ourselves: does it transgress unduly on individual freedoms? Does it transgress on individual rights? Does it tip the scale towards one side of the argument at the expense of the other? No-one from the coalition side and, in fact, I believe quite frankly none of the 76 senators who sit in this place would condone in any way racist behaviour. It is my opinion that all 76 of us would wholeheartedly condemn racism in any shape or form. Having said that, we then have to look at this bill and see whether it does the job that it sets out to do and determine whether we are giving up those principles which I mentioned at the outset for a bill which is unworkable or does not achieve the intention of the legislatures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill itself was first brought in in December 1992. It was not proceeded with due to the election in 1993 and so it now comes before the Senate some two years later. The bill is divided into two parts: part 2 deals with criminal offences; and part 3 deals with civil matters. Indeed, proposed sections 57, 58 and 60 deal with the criminal aspects, and I will come to those shortly. Recently, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee looked at this bill and took a good deal of evidence on the various points of view on the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add at the outset that one of the aspects that the bill looks at is acts done by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of a person. What came up before the committee was that in the United Kingdom employment and industrial tribunals had concluded that Moslems did not fall within the category of an `ethnic group'. So at the outset one has to ask whether that has been sufficiently defined&mdash;whether we have used the correct words in relation to the term `ethnic origin', because there is some precedent, I would suggest, in the United Kingdom that that does not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there was evidence from Mr Neave, the Deputy Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, that it may well be difficult to define the term `ethnic origin' in the bill in a manner that does not inadvertently exclude other groups. So I just signal that at the outset as a possible problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as freedom of speech went, the committee also received evidence from witnesses that the bill may well breach the implied constitutional guarantee of freedom of political discussion. Mr Peter Bailey, a Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of Law at the Australian National University and former Deputy Chairman of the Human Rights Commission, referred to the following statement by Professor Eric Barendt which was quoted by three of the justices who formed part of the majority in the High Court case of Theophanous. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Political speech' refers to all speech relevant to the development of public opinion on the whole range of issues which an intelligent citizen should think about.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bailey then commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that, if that is the broadly accepted definition by the High Court of political speech, it is difficult to think of much in the way of speech in a public space&mdash;which is what this legislation is about&mdash;that is not going to be deemed political . . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That being the case, the legislation has to get through the gateway put by the High Court, which broadly is that the means adopted are reasonably and appropriately adapted to achieve the desired end . . . . I think that is correct and I think that, given the multiplicity of reports that have come out on racial vilification, the High Court would be unlikely to say that you cannot have some kind of restrictions. The question is whether this legislation goes too far down the line of restriction . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bailey suggested that the removal of the proposed criminal offence of inciting racial hatred from the Crimes Act 1914, and its reformulation as a civil provision concerning racial harassment under the Racial Discrimination Act, would more appropriately meet the evil that is sought to be remedied, and therefore be more likely to withstand constitutional challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he was saying, in a nutshell, was that by the incorporation of these criminal sanctions you could well be running foul of recent decisions of the High Court. And at the end of the day if this bill is rendered unconstitutional, then you are definitely not serving the ends that the legislatures intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that the bill provided for three criminal offences. Briefly, they are as follows: proposed section 58 provides that it is an offence to threaten to cause physical harm to a person or group because of their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 59 provides that it is an offence to threaten to destroy or damage property because of the race of any other person or group. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 60 provides that it is a criminal offence to do an act, otherwise than in private, which is intended to incite racial hatred against any other person or group, and is reasonably likely to incite racial hatred. The act must be done because of the race of the other person or members of the group. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of these separate criminal offences for racially motivated crime has two major drawbacks. Firstly, an incalcitrant racist, I would suggest, would wish for nothing more than to be sentenced for racial beliefs or what he or she might perceive to be political beliefs. Recently we have seen extremists of various persuasions prefer gaol rather than comply with bail conditions to give publicity to their cause and thereby take a `moral stand'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia members of the Australian Nationalist Movement were gaoled for very lengthy periods of imprisonment pursuant to various sections of the criminal code in that state. That branded the members of that movement as common criminals&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. It did not allow Jack Van Tongeren, the leader, or his band to label themselves victims, martyrs or proponents of some political cause. But it simply labelled them as common criminals, and they were sentenced pursuant to the criminal provisions of the criminal code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the committee heard evidence that it is already an offence in all the states and territories of Australia to threaten to injure people or damage their property, regardless of motivation. It was also raised in evidence that the difficulty in proving the additional element that the substantial reason for the doing of the impugned act is the race of a person, could well lead to the acquittal of the accused person. It would be easier, I would suggest, to simply charge the person under the state or territory legislation without having that extra element to prove. Indeed, a number of witnesses pointed to that evidentiary problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I was representing a person who was charged with a racially motivated crime, I would much prefer to defend that charge under this bill than any provision of a state or territory, because the prosecution would have that added onus of proving that the act was racially motivated. But, of course, if it is a simple act of threatening to do something or damaging property, then you do not have to prove that at all. So, again, I would point that out as another flaw in this bill to those people who think that this provides the remedy for any ills that they perceive in society in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee had brought to its attention that one way of alleviating this problem of racist motivation might be in the sentencing process. That is, where you do find that the act is racially motivated, you could well then provide for an increased penalty. But you do not have that as part of the element of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the court finds that damage was done, there is a conviction, and subsequently in the sentencing process, if the offence was racially motivated, there will be an increased penalty. The penalties for state offences are much more than those provided for by this bill. Mr Pearce from the Victoria Civil Liberties Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But let me make this point about it. Under Section 198 of the Crimes Act in Victoria for example, for the threat to damage property the penalty is 10 years. Under this legislation I think it is two years. Under this legislation you get time off for being a racist.</PARA>
<PARA>In this case we are looking at a flawed response to the problems that concern people. There is ample provision in the states and territories for any offence of this kind. It has been demonstrated in Western Australia. In his evidence Mr Pearce makes it abundantly clear. I therefore put it to the Senate that proposed sections 58 and 59 are superfluous and go no further in addressing any question of racism in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that proposed section 60 offends the principle of freedom of speech perhaps more so than the other two sections. This section needs to be examined more closely. Many columnists&mdash;in particular Sir Maurice Byers QC, the former Solicitor-General&mdash;were quoted as expressing reservations about this aspect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 60 will only make incitement to racial hatred a criminal offence if done `otherwise than in private.' This would allow the insidious activity of inciting racial hatred in private but not publicly. One wonders where the rationale for that distinction lies. Clearly the legislation must be aimed at the outworking of racial hatred once instilled as opposed to the thought process pure and simple. Racial hatred will not manifest itself in a different form if the incitement was in private as opposed to public. Mr Bailey stated to the committee that section 60 ought to become part of the civil aspect of this legislation. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . But for my own experience of working with the Racial Discrimination Act in the 1980s, quite a lot are amenable to some kind of discussion and talk if you can approach them, not saying, `You are going to be put before the police and the Crimes Act,' but saying, `This kind of thing is not appropriate.' You can explain it to them, you can have a conciliation, and you can often bring about what we are really trying to achieve, which is the community that is comfortable with itself more than often results from criminal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state that his first problem in relation to section 60 concerned criminal proof beyond a reasonable doubt as opposed to the balance of probabilities. As regards proving these offences, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been found difficult in New Zealand, in France, in the United Kingdom, in the United States and in Canada.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that worldwide experience in this regard cannot be ignored. The phrase `otherwise than in private' is a difficult one to define and lawyers would have a bonanza in litigating that particular point. Mr Bartlett, a partner in the legal firm Minter Ellison, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would say that in my view the Bill will do nothing to reduce or stop racial hatred. It seeks to take the easy approach of hitting any offender with a big stick, rather than the more difficult task of further encouraging multiculturalism through education and assimilation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is really what the coalition is about: education, encouraging coexistence and not using the big stick to bludgeon people. Criminal sanction is not only superfluous in this manner but it will not result in any educative process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the civil aspects of the bill. The Racial Hatred Bill 1994 has directed civil sanctions at acts which are likely to `stir up hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule against a person or a group.' The proposed section 18C of the Racial Hatred Bill 1994 is directed at acts which are reasonable likely to `offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate.' The committee received evidence of concern that the term `offend' was seen to be too broad. Mr Pearce of the Victorian Civil Liberties Council said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Dealing first of all with the civil side, essentially the effect of that legislation will be to protect people from hurt feelings. The legislation is designed specifically and in terms to protect people from offence and insults. No other legislation or principle of law that we are aware of in this country has that effect.</PARA>
<PARA>There are exceptions, of course, to the application of section 18C and they deal with acts which are done reasonably and in good faith, in the course of an artistic performance, a statement, publication, discussion or debate held for any genuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose. Those acts can be exempted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in itself begs litigation. I put to the Senate that such definition would not advance in any way any anti-racist behaviour and will only be food for more litigation. There is another aspect which deals with the civil sanction applied to employers. A vicarious liability is imposed on employers in relation to racist acts committed by employees. I submit that there is a great problem with this aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, when we look at this bill we see that it is flawed. It will not do what people will say it will do. It will not achieve the intentions that the government has set out to implement. I believe that education is the way to solve this problem, not criminal sanctions and not definitions contained in provisions which deal with civil sanctions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can speak with authority on this subject as I grew up and went to school as the child of parents who migrated from Italy. I can remember the racial taunts, name calling and discrimination by teachers in school and in sport. I remember that as if it were yesterday. That was a shock to me when I started school at a late age. I did not have a grasp of the English language at the time. I soon learnt the fast way what I was being told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent my early childhood years with Italians mainly and some people from the former Republic of Yugoslavia. Those sorts of things did not happen with the young people and children whom I associated with. When I started school I certainly learnt what racism was all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a young adult, I considered that things would change and that people would learn to accept others, especially in the school system. I thought that teachers might change as time went on; but they did not, it got worse. There was more abuse and discrimination in sport. Later on when I went into business the same thing happened. Probably the worst thing I could do as a young adult was to form a romantic association with an Australian. I can tell you that that was an experience in terms of race, religion and whatever. They were not very good times whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Postwar migration led Australia to recognise that there are people around the world who have different ideas. I suppose we could have excused this verbal racial abuse because of the war and the fact that different countries were on different sides. My father spent time in the Italian army. After the massive migration program of the 1950s and 1960s, Australians started to change their attitudes because new Australians were around. In my younger days at school and soon after, I thought the only way of dealing with those sorts of racial taunts was not to have laws but a bunch of fives. Sometimes you were outnumbered very badly. Those sorts of things went on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In sport there were all sorts of discrimination and abuse. After dealing with all of those things which I and my brothers have experienced, I will not have anything to do with this sort of legislation. I think a good person to quote is B.A. Santamaria. I do not think he is unknown to a lot of people in this place. He stated:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A slur on good sense</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">B.A. Santamaria</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps one who was born in Australia, but both of whose parents were Italian and who therefore knows what ethnic slurs actually mean, need not apologise for dealing with the "anti-racialism" mania now sweeping both the media and the sporting world. He would like a dollar for every occasion, during his youth when he and other members of his family were insulted as "dagos". One of the fundamental truths which ethnic slurs taught him then was that while they were ill-bred, offensive and personally hurtful, it was necessary to keep a sense of proportion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a world full of the seemingly unavoidable suffering of hunger, disease and war, racial slurs remained offensive and hurtful but, measured on the barometer of suffering, they were relatively unimportant. If he was big enough, the victim would dish out a "backhander" to his verbal assailant; but the idea of passing a law to stop him, or hounding the assailant out of any position he might hold in public life for using offensive language would have been regarded as tripe. It remains tripe, and is not elevated from that category by the artificially hyped-up reaction of the media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not very nice that Collingwood ruckman Damien Monkhurst should call Essendon's Aboriginal star, Michael Long, a "black b. . . " when the latter sprawled all over his Collingwood opponent as he lay on the ground. Nor was it very nice for semi-drunken spectators to use similar expletives from over the fence. But have any of the journalists who have gone into a pious frenzy over the Monkhurst-Long incident ever gone to a football match? What kind of language do they think is normally used between players, occasionally between players and umpires, let alone by some of the spectators and not only in the "outer".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the world were a different place, none of this language would ever be used by any one of them. But it isn't a different place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Michael Long had had an Italian name and Monkhurst had called him a "wog", would we have had the columns of hypocritical breast-beating which has been served up because Michael Long, one of the most brilliant, effervescent and effective players in the AFL, is an Aborigine? If he had had an Irish name, and had been called a "Catholic b. . . " would the media have gone into such paroxysms of indignation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly with Arthur Tunstall and his rather crude joke, which, incidentally, was not told publicly at a meeting as original misreported, but around the lunch table. Watching the ABC's Andrew Olle trying to bully some sporting official or other into undertaking to drive Tunstall out of his official sporting position to pay the penalty of his plebeian humour inevitably turns one mind to the ABC itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was it not the ABC which cheerfully offended thousands of viewers by giving an hour of prime viewing time to the Gay Mardi Gras, thus celebrating a way of life which&mdash;whatever its attractions to some&mdash;is a major source of AIDS infection? That and the accompanying insults to the Pope and to the religious beliefs of a large part of the community are apparently not as offensive as Arthur Tunstall's "joke". Nobody in the ABC has lost his or her job for these grossly offensive programs and this abysmal waste of taxpayers' money. Only Arthur Tunstall was to lose his.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prominence given, in particular by television cameras, to Aboriginal athletes officially representing Australia running around, not with Australian but with Aboriginal flags wrapped around their shoulders, is nothing but short-term stupidity. Haven't they understood what is in store for NZ as a result of Maori separatism? Don't they understand that if you further confuse an already confused generation brought up with little history, steeped in the prevailing climate of moral and cultural relativism, with the indispensable symbolism of a single national flag routinely ridiculed, you are creating long-term problems which history may never give you the time to resolve?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nonsensical exaggeration associated with this campaign has reached its climax with the federal Racial Vilification Bill, presented to Parliament by the Keating Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On May 9 this year <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS> carried an article strongly supporting the Bill, contributed by a Mary Kalantsis, professor of education at James Cook University and Bill Cope, director of the Centre for Workplace Communication and Culture, at Sydney's University of Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the objection that the Federal Racial Vilification Bill would be used to curtail freedom of speech, the two academics answered by pointing to the administration of the Greiner legislation in NSW: "In the five years of operation of the Greiner legislation there is no evidence that one skerrick of speech was restricted. There have been 448 complaints: 80 in 1993-94. Only three have been recommended for prosecution and even then the prosecution did not proceed. Most cases were investigated and conciliated by the Anti-Discrimination Board."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does this prove, except that an expensive and unnecessary bureaucratic machinery is devoted to providing a "remedy" for a problem which does not exist? Out of 448 complaints, not a single prosecution! To say nothing of the days of taxpayer-funded time wasted on "conciliation".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unnecessary to appeal to the Australian people to regain a sense of proportion: the majority have it anyway. The politically correct&mdash;whether in the ABC, the commercial media, and/or university departments&mdash;who have made an industry out of allegations of racism, have merely substituted a threadbare ideology for commonsense. Not for the first or last time.</PARA>

It consists of changes to the Crimes Act and the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will use the sexual harassment legislation, which is something totally different, as an example. In 1992 the official definition of sexual harassment was changed. It now means that a complainant does not have to demonstrate disadvantage at work but only that he or she felt offended, humiliated or intimidated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to what I said before. So Senator Kemp, Senator MacGibbon and I would feel offended or humiliated to differing degrees. So where do you draw the line? I think the government is playing with fire in dealing with this sort of legislation. I believe it to be very dangerous. If this legislation does get on the statute books in Australia, I believe that we will be in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will have to realise eventually, and this is what I believe, that education is the only way to get over this problem. It has been said by many speakers on this side, and I believe I have shown this through my experience, that education is the way to go. After all, Australians have a capacity to change. If you take the last 20 or 30 years, Australian attitudes to migrants in general and those from particular parts of the world&mdash;such as Asia, South America, India and the Arab states&mdash;have changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attitudes to various things have changed. Australia is changing. There is no law that says you shall change any of your habits or anything like that, but they have changed. Australia accepts change. It creeps up. What was the average Australian menu 30 years ago? I reckon it was terrible. Unfortunately, I had to put up with it in the different places I lived. When I went home I really appreciated home cooking, continental cooking. Now you cannot find an Australian restaurant that does not have some international sort of cooking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place this sort of legislation with the sort of social engineering legislation that we have had at other times. I will use one as an example, though it was not quite social engineering&mdash;that is, the war crimes legislation that was debated when I first came into this place. After all the time we spent on it, after all the money that was spent setting up whatever goes with the legislation, what has happened? There has been no conviction in Australia, to my knowledge&mdash;one charge but no convictions. There are some figures from New South Wales which have shown it to be extremely difficult to prosecute. They have had three charges recommended by the DPP but none has come to trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something else that I believe could be reverse racism&mdash;that is, migrants to Australians and migrants to migrants.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe that the political correctness society has gone to extremes. I say again that it is dangerous. Remember also that racial taunts, racism and discrimination are not only against two or so societies in Australia but, if there are any, right across.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans, when he spoke in this debate, used the desecration of Eddie Mabo's grave as a reason for this legislation. Perhaps he did not see the article in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> which reported that three Aborigines were charged, or interrogated, about that. One does not necessarily want to jump to conclusions. It was the same when the Jewish cemetery was knocked around in Melbourne. The desecration of graves is abhorrent, and I believe there should be other ways of dealing with those responsible. At the same time the Jewish cemetery was damaged, a Catholic one in Melbourne was damaged also and very little was done about it. In short, even the Archbishop of Melbourne condemned the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Harassment of an individual or individuals because of their race by threats, intimidation or violence has no place in our society. No reasonable person would challenge that. Indeed, there are currently laws in place which prevent harassment on any grounds, not only racial grounds, with severe penalties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Racial Hatred Bill was only an irrelevant bill, it would be one thing but this bill fails to differentiate between what is offensive behaviour and what is harmful or dangerous behaviour. As such, it goes too far. It goes so far as to strike at the basic right of citizens in a democracy: the right of freedom of speech. The Royal Commission into Aboriginals Deaths in Custody and the Law Reform Commission's Multiculturalism and the Law Report concluded that making racial vilification a criminal offence would be too drastic a step and the civil remedies, together with conciliation, would be a more appropriate course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly the business of this legislature to legislate and regulate by passing laws for the benefit of all. But it has to be eternally on its guard that, in its zeal to protect the rights of members of the society, it does not diminish or remove the basic rights which are the foundations of a free society. This bill does that by openly reducing the right to freedom of expression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill sets out to amend the Crimes Act by adding three criminal offences&mdash;the first two involve threats of violence and the third involves an act which is reasonably likely to incite racial hatred. The first offence relates to threats to cause physical harm to a person because of their race, colour, nationality or ethnic origin. The second offence relates to threats to damage or to destroy property because of a person's race, colour, nationality or ethnic origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no quarrel with this. It has our full support. But we would point out that in all states of Australia both of these actions are against the law, and in many cases the penalties applying are higher than those proposed in this bill. It is the third offence that raises the real problems: doing a public act with the intention of inciting racial hatred if it is reasonably likely that the act will incite racial hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Racial hatred, surprisingly enough, is not defined in the definitions of the bill, which is the usual practice. The inciting of racial hatred must be done `otherwise than in private'&mdash;that is, in public. But there is a wide interpretation of what constitutes `in public'. The intention of the accused person must be to incite racial hatred. Then it must be proven that it was reasonably likely that the utterances would incite racial hatred. Note that the bill does not require that there has to be actual incitement to racial hatred, only&mdash;in the words of the act&mdash;`likely to cause'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would submit to the Senate that there are very real problems in applying this bill in the courts if it becomes law. The real danger is that, because of the wide ambit of this particular clause, freedom of expression will be inhibited. Our basic right of freedom of speech will be severely curtailed or it will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is misconceived. It demonstrates the age old belief of the Labor Party that all human relations problems can be solved and solved instantly by passing a law or laws. It has always been a criminal offence in this country when people assault one another or damage property, whether it is between differing ethnic groups or even between members of the same family. We on this side of the chamber support the prohibitions against those sorts of actions, and we support them unreservedly. There is not the slightest dispute about that. Where we differ from the government on this bill is in the treatment of verbal comment in the way the government treats it in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that words can be highly offensive. They can be very wounding. They can be very destructive. You cannot have people destroying the good working and harmonious relationships within society by an irresponsible or malicious use of words. But the answer to that, as so many speakers on this side have said, is education, not the heavy hand of the law. It is just commonsense that you cannot go around being rude to people. At the end of the day, it gets down to having manners, and good manners at that. But the Labor Party never sees any place for manners. They deride manners as having no place. They see them as a relic from the past, retained by a few misguided people who want to live in a former age. But manners are not that. They are one of the essential lubricants of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You might smile, Acting Deputy President McKiernan, but I came down in a plane with one of your colleagues who described one of his other colleagues as the rudest person that he has ever met in his life. It illustrates the point I am making that manners are one of the essential lubricants of society. They are the oil that allows people from different backgrounds to mix pleasantly and cooperatively within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key answers to racial tension within our society is education which will bring the tolerance that we need, the exposure of one community group to practices and the habits of another and the encouragement of a live and let live philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much debate of late in the media, with the community expressing its views on this legislation. I would like to quote from one of the newspaper correspondents on this matter, Mr Damien Grace, from the University of New South Wales. He wrote most eloquently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole point of living in a liberal society is to accept a kind of secular turning of the other cheek: it is better to have the kind of freedom which enables people to offend you than to have the kind of social controls which might ultimately be used against you.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party, controlled by the social engineers with their immature and mechanistic theories of how an ideal society should work, simply does not understand this. The other point is that the Labor Party never has any patience. It will not take the long-term view. It wants an instant fix for all of society's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There have always been tensions in Australian society, right from the time of early settlement. No gulf could possibly have been wider than the gulf between the Rum Corps and the convicts, but that gulf was resolved generations ago. As Senator Panizza said, after the Second World War there was great division between the migrants and the native born community. But today that is no longer relevant. It is fair to say that in all societies there is some conflict within them because no society is homogeneous, with the possible exception of Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does have to recognise and should get credit for the fact that it has come a very long way in overcoming these internal tensions and in so doing has made some very real and laudable achievements. Australian society has changed and it will continue to change because the community does have a great deal of tolerance within it, and that tolerance is increasing. The public has a great well of commonsense, far more at times than is shown by members of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are people in Australia who are racially intolerant, but I have lived out of Australia for a long and significant part of my adult life.

It is more tolerant of newcomers and it is more tolerant of different practices than any country I know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is important that we maintain a sense of perspective about Australian society. To go down the path of solving our problems&mdash;problems which stem from a lack of education and understanding&mdash;by resorting to legislative means is doomed to failure. The real tragedy is that, when this legislation fails, the same social engineers who gave us this policy will respond with even harsher and more draconian legislation, and you can be absolutely certain of that. There is a better approach. Let us reduce the problems we have in our society by reason, not by the excessive use of force which destroys our basic rights. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make a few brief comments in relation to this document. Those who may be listening to this broadcast may be interested to know that this document has 427 pages in it and I am allowed some five minutes to address the matters contained therein. However, a good place to start with these documents is always in the foreword. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, refers to the ACTU as the most representative organisation of workers and thanks them for their contribution. Let me say that this government, unfortunately, has a penchant for dealing with peak groups rather than constituent groups and individuals within the community and has thus alienated large sections of the community. Indeed, the ACTU has alienated large sections of the community, as witnessed by its ever decreasing membership. I am sure that, despite the Labor Party's intentions of moving Mr Ferguson from his role in the ACTU into the federal parliament, the slide will continue even under his proposed successor, Jennie George. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are discussing the International Labour Organisation and the status of its conventions in Australia. On page 381 we have a most interesting list of the member states of the ILO&mdash;those sorts of countries that together provide the excellent examples of the labour relations that we in Australia can learn from. Indeed, there are 171 members. There are countries with such excellent employee relations as China, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Vietnam. I am just going through the alphabetical listing at random and I see all these countries listed which, quite frankly, ought be paying a greater regard to the standards that we employ in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also bring to the Senate's attention that the number of conventions undertaken by the ILO now amount to 175. They also have this animal, apart from their conventions, called recommendations. They have 175 conventions and 182 recommendations, all of course dealing with separate matters. It is interesting to note that when the federal government deals with such things as international treaties it always tells us that the list is about 922 and that the ILO is dealing just with the one issue of labour relations. But as we can see here, the ILO itself has 175 conventions and 182 recommendations. It is under the ILO that so much of this government's industrial relations legislation is based. One cannot help thinking of certain legislation such as unfair dismissals, which at the end of the day the government and that dynamic Minister Brereton tell us is based on our international obligation. `We have to legislate, we have to do this to bring us into line with certain international obligations.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, when there is too much domestic pressure brought to bear, all of a sudden this interpretation of what our international obligations are changes; and the minister is prepared to change the legislation. So, methinks that the government relies on the ILO just as a smokescreen for itself&mdash;for its domestic legislation&mdash;rather than giving due and serious consideration to what its obligations are to the Australian worker and to the Australian economic community. If this government focused more on its responsibility to Australian workers, Australian businesses and the Australian economy, rather than concentrating on its alleged obligations to the ILO, I believe this country and its industrial relations system would be a lot better off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening I was developing a number of matters in relation to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and specifically in relation to the preparation of pituitary hormones which were used to treat some 2,600 people over approximately 20 years from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. I was developing the theme, within the 10-minute time frame, that during nearly all of that time the CSL had failed dismally to develop a code of good manufacturing practice; and indeed had resisted the application of a code of good manufacturing practice as it was developed during the years which were coincident in part with the manufacture of the pituitary hormones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then went on and was beginning to develop some specific examples of the way in which CSL had failed to observe that code of good manufacturing practice with respect to therapeutic goods. I was pointing out that one of the criteria for the code of good manufacturing practice with respect to therapeutic goods is that before you actually put any of these goods on the market you have a well developed program for the manufacture of these goods which guarantees the quality of the materials which go into the manufacture, the sterility of the process, the efficacy of the product which you are putting onto the market and so on; so that when you eventually provide that product to the public, it can have assurance that the product is safe, effective, the dose is known and that it has been manufactured by a process which is consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was making the point that the code requires that there be a set of complete and comprehensive master manufacturing instructions for every product formally authorised by management and that this be changed and updated only through processes of formal authorisation. It must be strictly adhered to throughout the manufacture of each batch of the product. This is to ensure that before any product goes into production for distribution&mdash;or even for clinical trials&mdash;the manufacturer has developed and fully documented a process which will ensure that the product is consistent and reliable from batch to batch and, likewise, that the product when clinically trialled will be reproduced batch after batch, after production and before general distribution is begun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is abundantly clear&mdash;and this is where I got to last night&mdash;from the Allars report that CSL failed to develop a satisfactory process for the manufacturing of hormone products before they went into production. I gave several examples of batches which were manufactured by quite different processes without any proper documentation; and those batches found their way onto the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out that appendix 2 of the Allars report shows that finished batches not infrequently were unsterile, pyrogenic&mdash;that is, they caused temperature increases when injected&mdash;contained hepatitis B, could not be assayed for hormone content, contained uncontrolled amounts of extraneous substances and caused stinging on injection. Pyrexia often followed the injection of the hormone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were persistent problems with freeze drying of the products, ampoules were sometimes not properly sealed&mdash;which, of course, rendered them subject to lack of sterility&mdash;and batches were often highly discoloured. In other words, there was enormous variability from batch to batch. In addition, labelling and packaging errors occurred from time to time. So much for the development of a standard protocol for the manufacture of these products and for CSL's adherence to anything approaching a code of good manufacturing practice!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Allars report notes that batches with unsterile, pyrogenic hepatitis and other faulty batches were sometimes reprocessed and then either released or blended with other batches and then released for distribution. As I have shown clearly already in a previous adjournment address, it was known that the infective agents which were responsible for the transmission of CJD came through chromatography columns first&mdash;in other words, they were eluted first&mdash;and were especially difficult to kill so that no amount of reprocessing should have allowed these products onto the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code requires that all ingredients and starting materials come from approved and identified sources, be subject to appropriate quality control specifications and, before use, have been examined for compliance with the specifications released for use on the basis of compliance. In other words, one knows precisely, reliably and consistently what goes into the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But CSL often did not know the sources of the pituitary glands; it was willing to accept glands from extremely suspect sources that should never have been approved. Such sources include Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Malaysia and mental and geriatric hospitals. CSL had no quality control specifications for the glands. The poor quality of the glands was a prime source of the low yields of the hormone, the poor quality and inconsistency of the products, and many of the problems of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complete absence of quality control over the glands is astonishing in itself, but all the more so since their quality was of critical importance to the success of the production process. If these glands were already infected, then the yields of the hormones which were obtainable from those glands were already diminished. It was known from the outset that the glands might contain live viruses or, as we now call the CJD causative factor, prions. There was no way of testing for these agents in individual glands, no way of testing the glands that would destroy those agents if they were present, no way of testing the final product and no way of removing the agents from the final product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As explained several times, if the agent was present it would elute from the chromatography column first, with the potential that every hormone which eluted from that column afterwards would be contaminated. Considering all this, it was even more essential for there to have been an exceptionally high standard adopted in relation to the source of the glands, the method of collection and their storage and transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code requires that manufacturers have a quality control department which reports directly to top management and is independent of the production department. The quality control department is, among other things, responsible for the quality control specifications of the raw materials as well as the finished product, the labelling and the packaging. It is this department, under the code of good manufacturing practice, which would be responsible for the rejection of any product which did not meet the specification. CSL did not subscribe to this concept of independent quality control. Product release was in the hands of the production department, the very people who were manufacturing the hormone. So there was no independent control until late in the hormone program&mdash;until the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Storage trials were perfunctory and valid shelf life was not established either before the products were placed on the market or subsequently. Stability data was meaningless. Sterile materials and equipment should have been used throughout the preparation of the hormones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL did not adopt these precautions. The glands were often grossly contaminated; the fractionation columns were not sterile; and there was plenty of opportunity for organisms to multiply, and they probably did, during the long periods in which the materials would have been passing through the fractionation columns. There were then further shortcomings in the sterility of the rooms in which the processing was carried out, in the transfer of the fractionated material to the ampoules for freeze drying and in the transfer of the ampoules to the freeze drier and from there to the ampoule sealing machine. As mentioned already, some ampoules remained not properly sealed and were distributed in that form&mdash;where clearly they could become contaminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not permit a more detailed and extensive examination of these and a whole raft of other defects which accompanied the manufacture by CSL not only of pituitary hormones but of many of their other products as well. I had hoped that this material would be put before a Senate committee yesterday but, clearly, the coalition still to this stage thinks that its political agenda is more important than the lives and wellbeing of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Senator Herron is now in the chamber. I just very briefly say to Senator Herron: there are 660 Australians who have joined a pro-active group because they are very concerned about what they have received, and 140 of them have issued writs against CSL. Those people should not be forced to go into court and be subjected to an adversarial process to establish the basic facts. Those facts should be clearly laid on the table before a Senate committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During this debate on the adjournment, I wanted to take the occasion to briefly pay tribute to a person who passed away recently. There is a notice of motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> concerning this matter which was put down by the minister for sport yesterday. I refer to Margaret Pewtress, a lady who deserves the credit for the state of netball in Australia at the moment. Margaret passed away shortly after the Australian team won against South Africa in the final of the recent world championship held in Great Britain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Margaret has an enormous reputation both across Australia, wherever netball is played, and all around the world. It is a great credit to her that, in this year when she sadly was lost to Australia, to Australian netball and to sports generally, we were able to win not only the world netball championship at the open level but also the under-21 championship. It was my great privilege during the last sitting session to go out to watch a game being played between the New Zealand and the Australian under-21 teams, and see the Australians win that game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As shadow minister for sports over the last year or so, I have had the privilege to meet Margaret on a number of occasions, mostly at Confederation of Sport functions. I am privileged to have met the lady. But you do not need to meet Margaret when you travel around and meet people involved in sport in Australia, because she is a legend and will remain a legend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note just briefly that Margaret was the President of the All Australia Netball Association. She served as a member on the board of the Australian Sports Commission and made an incredible contribution to the development of that organisation. She was a tireless worker not only for netball but for all sports in this country and, very importantly, made a great contribution to the development of sport for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also did an enormous amount to promote the coverage that the media give to women in sport. I think all of us who follow sports in Australia will know the incredible boost that the coverage of women's sport got out of that thrilling win in the world championships in Sydney in 1991. Indeed, Margaret deserves enormous credit for the work that she did in getting those world championships to Sydney. Her work in organising those championships ensured that she received plaudits and appreciation from right around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Margaret is an example of someone who has gone on from being a player. She played in the Melbourne Netball Club and was regarded as a very good player. After her playing days she went on to become a successful coach, both for Victoria and for Australia; she went on to become a national selector; and then she went on to become a distinguished administrator&mdash;one of the great administrators in the relatively short history of Australian sport. She also gave great service to the Victorian Sports Council and went on to accept the great challenge at that stage of chairing the inaugural National Women's Sport Unit, which has certainly done great work in increasing not only the participation of women in sport but also, as I said earlier, the recognition of women in sport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I&mdash;unusually for men in Australia&mdash;have had the rare privilege, you might call it, of actually playing netball. It is one of the attributes that not many people around here know that I have got. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before entering parliament, one of my many hidden talents was playing mixed netball in the home town of Perth that we both share. So I have a very special appreciation of the incredible skill that is involved in that game. I say to all that the skills needed in netball are not entirely contained in this athlete that stands before you&mdash;because I used to get into enormous trouble with the referees and some of the other players&mdash;but I do have a very special understanding of the skills involved in playing the game.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Having watched the game played at the very top levels, you can see what a tremendous game it is and the incredible skill we have got. I say very sincerely to senators, to all of the Australian public and particularly to Margaret's husband, Bill; her daughter, Elizabeth; her sons, Stephen and Ian; and her grandchildren, Chloe and Bryce: Margaret made an incredible contribution to this nation. A lot of people will watch netball on television. It is something that is only a relatively recent television sporting event. But the fact that so many Australians are able to watch netball on television and be so proud of our champion teams in both the under-21s and the open team is something that we owe Margaret Pewtress in particular. Australia has lost a very, very fine contributor to this nation. I wanted to take this occasion to record that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and before this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish tonight to address some of the underlying issues in relation to the French and Chinese nuclear testing. The achievement and maintenance of a global nuclear test ban treaty must surely be one of our most urgent and enduring goals, because no single issue is more important for the future health and survival of all living creatures. It is not enough, however, to stop radioactive fallout from tests. If this planet is to sustain life, we must outlaw the production and use of nuclear weapons in all forms: large and small, neutron, theatre nuclear or long-range missile deployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In parallel, too, must go the universal acceptance and enforcement of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to ensure the effective monitoring of the movement and processing of all fissile material, such as uranium and thorium, to prevent enrichment to weapons-grade. In the absence of full compliance and rigorous surveillance, the world can be held to ransom by nuclear terrorism or political blackmail. In a 1985 policy statement, the Liberal Party said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In a nuclear war there can be no winners, no escape for neutral nations and no protection in so-called nuclear free zones. Nuclear effects are world-wide. No nation, no matter where situated, can opt out of a nuclear war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is not sufficient to try to prevent only nuclear war. Conventional weapons (including chemical and biological weapons) are greatly increasing in lethal and destructive power. Moreover, a conventional war involving significant interests of major powers could rapidly escalate into a nuclear exchange.</PARA>
<PARA>There can be no small or limited nuclear exchanges. The initial pre-emptive strike must be of such a magnitude as to totally destroy the opponent and to prevent retaliation. A strike of that magnitude clearly has global consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not sufficient for nations or scientists to argue that the nuclear tests are such as to be harmless to the environment. This cannot be proven. Scientists are yet unable to state with any certainty the particular threshold of intensity below which radioactivity is not harmful to life on earth. In the face of this, the only sensible policy for governments and individuals alike is to strive to ensure that all avoidable man-made radioactivity is reduced to a minimum. We cannot escape the effects of natural radiation. It is everywhere around us&mdash;in the atmosphere, the rocks, the vegetation, the food chain, our own bodies. It is in the building materials of our homes and our offices. It increases significantly too with altitude above sea level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout history until recently life on earth seems to have coped successfully with natural radiation and adapted to it with skin pigmentation and other defence mechanisms. In those times population size and inventiveness were insufficient to seriously damage the environment, unlike today when the greenhouse effect and acid rain and damage to the ozone layer pose very serious threats to the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Restricting nuclear testing to a particular nation's backyard offers no safety to the rest of the globe. The diurnal spin of the earth ensures that wherever new radioactivity is generated there will be a `cosmic mix' resulting over time in an even distribution over the whole planet. In the end we all experience a fallout from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, the Manhattan project, Lop Nor, Muraroa, and, of course, Chernobyl. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Natural radiation at sea level in Sydney is said to average around 100 millirads. To this must be added a further two millirads for the effects of the accumulation of all the previous nuclear fallout from man-made devices. Canberra residents must also add another two millirads in respect of the higher altitude here. In other parts of the world in higher altitudes radiation levels are often significantly higher. However, it is not possible to say with certainty that there are no adverse effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radioactive materials are increasingly used in medical treatment and diagnosis as well as industry. Most of these have a very short shelf-life and are subject to strict regulations. But the long-term disposal of radioactive waste demands expert and thorough scrutiny. All other sources of possible radiation such as high transmission power lines and communication devices merit constant research and investigation to ensure that there are no deleterious effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the complacency which has followed the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, pressure may have well lessened the drive for nuclear arms reduction. There is evidence that in Russia and the Ukraine a number of nuclear weapons are being dismantled and the plutonium component removed. However, nuclear capacity cannot be measured simply by the size and number of warheads. The great scientific advances in the range and accuracy of delivery vehicles have ensured that fewer and smaller warheads can be at least as effective. In any case, for the long range future there will be immensely more nuclear weapons than are necessary to destroy this world many times over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what to do with the increasing stockpile of  plutonium, a highly poisonous man-made element, whose PU23 fissionable isotope has a half-life of 24,000 years? With perhaps four or five kilograms to make an atomic explosive, Russia is said to have had at least 4,000 kilograms and the USA perhaps 1,500. The suggestion of the creation of an international plutonium bank, a nuclear Fort Knox, has not progressed very far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The knowledge to make nuclear weapons is now and forever available to all mankind. The fissionable materials are freely accessible on every continent and in the oceans. Any country with a reasonable industrial infrastructure could produce a nuclear device and some form of delivery system. And against that background of potential, it is always possible that a significant conventional war could accelerate into a nuclear holocaust. Clearly then, the immediate and long range issues are bigger and more enduring than any current protest against French and Chinese nuclear tests, however important those protests are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need is for Australia and other countries to pursue a concerted and sustained pressure to achieve eight main goals: firstly, to persuade those countries not yet signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to become parties to the treaty, to observe its provisions and to permit full and open access to international inspection; secondly, to urge all nations to become signatories to the nuclear test ban treaty; thirdly, to work within the United Nations for a sustained and rigorous program to reduce nuclear armaments involving all current and potential nuclear powers; fourthly, to accelerate pressure at the international level for a treaty banning chemical and biological warfare; fifthly, to seek a world conference and ultimate treaty on conventional weapons disarmament and the limitation and regulation of international articles sales; sixthly, to urge the maintenance and strengthening of NATO as demonstrably the one successful collective security force on the European continent; seventhly, to review in-depth the potential and reality of the United Nations as the world agency for peacekeeping and collective security and to endeavour to strengthen its capacity to act with speed and success on those roles; and, eighthly, to review Australia's capacity to participate as a good neighbour in collective security and peacekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year Australia Remembers, it should be constantly stressed that World War II would not have occurred if the League of Nations had functioned effectively, if arms limitations had been enforced and if a reasonable collective security intervention had occurred in the mid-1930s both in Europe and in Asia. In those years our international and regional collective security arrangements were grossly inadequate and nations were unwilling to act. Are we any better equipped today or are we similarly in the grip of complacency, isolationism and a, however natural, unwillingness to risk human lives and resources in what are seen to be, however myopically, not our problems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1930s Manchuria and China were not seen to be the problem of the USA or other Pacific nations yet they were the very stepping stones to the edge of Australia. The annexation of the Saar and Austria and the invasion of Czechoslovakia were not seen to be the problems of France or the United Kingdom, but they proved to be the springboards to the English Channel. Let us use the background of Australia Remembers to remind ourselves of our past failures to prevent global war and to concentrate our minds on how not to repeat those errors in the future. That is our duty to the generations ahead who, thankfully for them, were not able to remember. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) One cooperative research activity is currently in the planning stage to take advantage of some rocket launches by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Woomera in late 1995 under a longstanding agreement with the Australian Space Office. NASA has agreed to notify the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and the US Ballistic Missile Defense Organisation (BMDO) of the times of the launches, which are separate and independent activities. DSTO, in collaboration with the BMDO, will observe the rocket ascent for missile defence related research. For further background I refer the honourable senator to the answer tabled in response to Senate Question on Notice No. 2221 of 13 June 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. President Clinton has reaffirmed the US policy of adherence to the ABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty (as amended) allows the parties to develop and test systems dedicated to defence against strategic missiles but limits deployment to 100 interceptors at a single location. The US has not exercised this option and has no operational system capable of defending its territory against strategic ballistic missile attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its ballistic missile defence effort, the US is pursuing what it terms a technological readiness program in respect of defences against strategic ballistic missiles. As noted, this activity is fully consistent with the ABM Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) program in the US in recent years has been the development of systems to protect forward-deployed and expeditionary elements of the US armed forces (as well as any allied or friendly forces) against shorter range theatre and tactical ballistic missiles, including Scud missiles of the type used by Iraq during the Gulf War. The deployment of BMD systems of this kind is not prohibited by the ABM Treaty. There are ongoing negotiations between the US and Russia to explore the scope for more precise criteria to distinguish strategic and theatre ballistic missile defences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No. The Theatre High-Altitude Area-Defence is the first system designed by the US specifically for theatre missile defence. The system is currently under development in the US and is not scheduled for fully operational deployment until around 2002. Whether the system when developed and deployed will have any capability against long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, and whether that capability is such as to give rise to an ABM Treaty compliance issue, will be matters for the parties to the Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) Australia is not involved in or supportive of any activity that is a violation of the ABM Treaty. In accordance with US Government policy, the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organisation, Lieutenant General O'Neill, has advised the US Congress in written testimony (Statement to the Committee on Appropriations on 22 March 1995) that the Department of Defense carefully examines each of its experiments, as well as systems in development, to ensure that all its efforts are ABM Treaty compliant. All cooperative projects involving DSTO will be fully consistent with the Australian Government's position on the importance of the ABM Treaty for the stability of the strategic nuclear balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DSTO cooperation with the BMDO is expected to benefit Australia for reasons outlined in the answer to part 3 of Question 2221. It will also build on Australia's long record of constructive engagement in activities designed to counter the destabilising effects of ballistic missile proliferation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) As recently as May 1995 in Moscow, the US and Russia reaffirmed their commitment to the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of strategic stability. On the same occasion, the two parties agreed that each should have the option to establish and deploy effective theatre missile defence systems. As a basis for further discussions on the demarcation between strategic and theatre missile defence systems, they also agreed that any theatre missile defence systems that may be deployed, firstly, will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side; and, secondly, will not be tested to give such systems that capability. In the event of a dispute over the interpretation of the ABM Treaty it would be up to the parties to the Treaty to determine how that dispute should be resolved, having regard to the provisions of the Treaty for dealing with such eventualities.</PARA>
