<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was contending that being of mature age and being long-term unemployed are two great barriers to re-entry into the work force. As one witness told the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to get to people before they become de-motivated and totally debilitated. That is essential. It is no good waiting until someone has been unemployed for two years before you come along and offer some assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>There is clearly a need to make the whole system more flexible. National programs must be tailored to the needs of individual regions in order for them to have any chance of being effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the hearings for the unemployment report there were cases presented of programs successfully running at a community level that were to have their funding stopped because they did not fit neatly into department categories. The government prefers to see people taken off the long-term unemployment lists and placed in subsidised job projects. This serves the purpose of making the unemployment figures appear rosier but unfortunately does little for the unemployed worker in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the programs specifically targeted to indigenous people is the community development employment project scheme, CDEP. The evidence put to the Senate long-term unemployment inquiry suggested that opinion in the Aboriginal community is far from supportive of the scheme. Said one indigenous witness of CDEP:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also a way of disguising unemployment figures in terms of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>The witness also contended that CDEP failed to provide adequate training for future employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following estimates of various employment programs show the incidence of unemployment around three months after programs assistance had ended. For instance, in Aboriginal employment schemes, 57.3 per cent were still unemployed; in the program known as jobtrain, 63.4 per cent; in jobclubs, 59.4 per cent; in jobskills, 60.3 per cent; and in LEAP, 60.7 per cent. Even the most successful of the government's employment programs had an unemployment rate of 37.6 per cent three months after completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the numbers in continuing program assistance, that is, people in another training program three months after finishing one, the figures are even more damning. They are 48.2 per cent in OLMA; 31 per cent in jobtrain; 27.4 per cent in Aboriginal employment; 29.8 per cent in jobclubs; and 19.1 per cent in LEAP. A more cynical person than I would suggest that this plethora of training programs was being used to remove people from unemployment lists in the lead-up to the election. Unfortunately, even these are not entirely successful, as the unemployment figure has increased over the past few months from a general level of 8.2 per cent in June to 8.7 last month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has nothing to be proud of as regards Australia's unemployment problem. The government has even stopped producing youth unemployment figures because it claims they are too volatile. What are they trying to hide? We know what they are trying to hide: very high youth unemployment figures in many urban and many rural and regional centres throughout Australia. This government likes to talk about the $2.2 billion it has spent on Working Nation but, when all the rhetoric is laid aside, the government cannot escape the fact that there are still 787,600 people classified as unemployed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and one-third of that total are classified as long-term unemployed. This government has failed to adequately address the massive unemployment problem still faced by this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with considerable pleasure that I rise today to speak on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. I will only be talking about schedule 1, but I do want to go into some of the historic background of how we are where we are today on this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very important day for many pensioners because it is the end, once this legislation becomes effective next year, of unrealised capital growth treated as income for pension purposes. When the whole concept of unrealised capital gains came before us in 1992, only the Democrats said that it was unworkable, that it was unfair, and we pointed out a whole range of other problems, including the fact that you are actually dissuading people from investing in Australian companies. Having listened to Senator Troeth's speech and the notes that she has made regarding unemployment, one would have thought that the government would actually be encouraging people to invest in Australian companies, but not so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We continued the pressure on the government to change its mind and to remove those provisions. It was not until the community began to feel the effects of this treatment of shares, and particularly the effect on their pensions, that momentum built up and eventually, towards the end of 1993, the government agreed to some changes. It agreed to take out retrospectivity so that pensioners and part pensioners who had bought shares prior to August 1992 were no longer subjected to unrealised capital growth test, and this helped more than 100,000 retired Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we did not stop there. What we wanted to see, and what we are finally seeing, is that measure removed altogether. The inequity and the incredible bureaucratic problems with this, the continuing assessment of what the share gains were month after month, highlighted for many pensioners real difficulties in the possibility of them maintaining their investment in shares. Unfortunately, we will see that many have decided that it simply is not worth the hassle any longer and have decided to sell their shares and move their investments elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we continued to press for a review of the income and assets test for age pensions and, eventually when the government agreed to this, we were very pleased to see that it was conducted by Ageing Agendas in a fashion that enabled huge numbers of people to have their voices heard, to put in submissions. It was the findings of that review plus, I suspect, the growing opposition from pensioner groups across Australia that has seen the last of unrealised capital growth. We already heard in this year's May budget that the minister would be introducing extended deeming rates on all financial investments from 1 July next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extended deeming will apply to pensioners' financial investments, including bank accounts, term deposits, shares, friendly society bonds and other managed investments such as equity trusts. It effectively means that capital growth or unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments will not be treated as income. Therefore, for this reason and for its simplicity, the Democrats are supporting this extended deeming. We see it as a fairer, more equitable assessment method of financial investments for those who wish to qualify to receive an age pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extended deeming has also won, after considerable debate and discussion, the support from pensioner and welfare groups, such as the Council on the Ageing, Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation and the Australian Council of Social Service. What opposition there has been to this legislation has come mainly from the Australian Friendly Societies Association, whose members feel they will be disadvantaged because the two-tiered deeming rates do not recognise those investments, like friendly society saved bonds that pre-pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have been concerned and still are concerned about those pensioners and part-pensioners with friendly society bonds. It is obvious that, on present rates of return, these investments&mdash;because, as I said, they pre-pay tax at 33 per cent&mdash;cannot return their investors anywhere near the proposed extended deeming rates of five per cent and seven per cent. As a result, the Australian Friendly Societies Association, on behalf of its members, has sought an amendment which would introduce a modified deeming rate for pre-taxed investments. The proposal is for a modified rate that is less than the 33 per cent for pre-paid tax investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that the Democrats have with such an amendment is that it fundamentally changes the idea behind extended deeming. It ceases to offer equity. Instead it introduces a product based deeming rate. This could lead to demands that other investment products receive the same treatment. It jeopardises one of the main advantages of extended deeming: its simplicity and emphasis on higher yielding investments. It is encouragement for pensioners to actually go out and do the best possible thing they can with their money than to simply have a flat deeming rate, whatever it is they are able to earn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that any broader amendment to protect friendly society bonds could attract pensioners to an investment which, for the vast majority of them, is not an attractive proposition. As pointed out by the Australian Pensioners Superannuants Federation, two-thirds of pensioners do not pay tax, so paying 33 per cent on friendly society bonds makes them a very unattractive investment in the first place. Even a recent survey by the Australian Friendly Societies Association found that almost 42 per cent of its members paid no tax and 29 per cent are in the marginal 20 per cent tax group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To agree to a special product based deeming rate for friendly society bonds would encourage, I think, pensioners to maintain these investments and not to move on to take full advantage of the benefits of extended deeming. That does not mean we should not be concerned for those pensioners left holding friendly society bonds and, in particular, those with the smaller friendly societies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that larger friendly societies have the scope to offer their members a range of other products that could mean returns either matching, if not bettering, the proposed deeming rates. It is the smaller societies, most of them based in Victoria, who are very much limited as to the products they can offer their members. We must also remember that many pensioners and part-pensioners do not want to be forced by this government to re-invest their savings. They have chosen their retirement investment portfolio for its security. They do not want to be forced to change now. It is these pensioners' concerns the Australian Democrats are most concerned about. We really do need to address them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Friendly societies naturally are concerned about a run on investment once deeming is introduced. That is a real concern. Most friendly societies have been assuring members they can meet any call on funds by their investors. Indeed if there was such a run, particularly a run on the smaller friendly societies, from pensioners wishing to sell their investments, then this legislation does have a provision that can be used to exclude certain investments from extended deeming and so protect the investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 1084 of the legislation provides for the minister to make a determination to exclude specified financial investments or a specified class of financial investment from the deeming provisions. This would have the effect that only the actual return on the specified investments, if any, would be taken into account under the incomes test. I have sought and got assurances in writing from the minister that this provision would be used to protect any friendly societies finding themselves in such difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems obvious to me that this anomaly that finds friendly societies saved bonds disadvantaged by extended deeming would be better addressed in the tax system rather than in social security. Treasury is currently conducting a review of the whole trustee tax issue. Part of that review would be to provide friendly societies with the opportunity of offering bonus paying bonds which are untaxed at source and assessed in the hands of the individual investor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Friendly Societies Association has requested that Treasury, as a matter of urgency, give a firm commitment that such a change would be forthcoming to avoid the problem of those pensioners and part-pensioners with friendly society investments being forced to sell their investments before or soon after the introduction of extended deeming next year. Solving this problem through the tax legislation is, it seems to me, the more complete and permanent solution. I urge the government to allow friendly societies to be able to offer bonus paying bonds untaxed at source for the sake of those pensioners and part-pensioners who do not want to be forced to sell up their friendly society investments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in a quandary because I have to speak to three bills. I will speak to two of them and my colleague Senator Margetts will speak to the third. I was also in a quandary over which one to speak to first. It is almost arbitrary, but I will speak to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill first because it has only one amendment whereas the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill has several amendments. If I run out of time I can speak about that during the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is debating the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 which puts into place a number of changes to the two principal acts of the title. The major changes enacted by the bill are welcomed and have the support of the Greens (WA). That said, there are some measures in the bill which we are concerned about as seems to be the case with almost every social security bill which comes before the chamber. Some of these concerns we raise often in the Senate, but others are specific to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a comment at this point about the most important part of the bill&mdash;namely, the new deeming structure for those people receiving a social security pension which is affected by their investments. All senators would recall the extraordinary difficulties created by the previous approach to assets and income testing for this group in the community. I am sure that the experience in my office of confused and angry people ringing or writing to complain about the system is shared by all other senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced this change in the budget in May this year to almost universal acclaim. Since then that sense of welcome for this new structure has not changed even though people have reservations. Certainly, the Greens welcomed the budget announcement as not only a move towards more equitable arrangements but also a sign of the government's commitment to simplifying the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will raise one niggling complaint which is not related to the bill but to the explanatory memorandum. I have mentioned this on previous occasions. The explanatory memorandum appears to be used as a propaganda tool rather than as a technical document. Page 4 of the explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most social security recipients will be unaffected by extended deeming.</PARA>
<PARA>At first glance that statement is quite straightforward and without flaw. However, the fact is that every pensioner with investments will be affected. They may not have the amount of their pension changed, but the Department of Social Security will need to measure their investments to ascertain whether or not the rate of their pension will alter. I make this point because of the significance of the explanatory memorandum in the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the particular paragraph is unlikely to ever be crucial in a court case, I have referred on a number of occasions to the lack of precision that is creeping in. In case those comments should cause any concern to people who may be listening to this debate, I am informed by the department that very few people will be adversely affected by the changes. I commend the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) for his continued commitment to simplifying measures such as this. No doubt some of the technicalities will receive extended discussion in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter in relation to this change, and one of greater substance than the one I have just mentioned, is the lack of a legislative framework establishing an assets assessment structure. It is one thing to say that from now on investments held by pensioners will be deemed to be earning a certain level of income, but it is not a complete measure without telling people when their investments will be valued. As was pointed out to me by the Welfare Rights Centre, it could lead to the absurd situation where two pensioners, neighbours even, could have identical investment portfolios valued quite differently because of different valuation dates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been assured by the minister's office that there will be a way of adjusting that administratively rather than legislatively by eventually looking at six-monthly intervals of March, July and September. That makes me somewhat uneasy as it would seem that a change as significant as this one would be best brought about by means of the most certain powers available. I would appreciate some further comment about that from the minister responsible at an appropriate time in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I move on from schedule 1, there is another matter that I believe needs to be raised. I refer honourable senators to proposed section 1073 in clause 28 which deals with certain amounts taken to be received over 12 months. This is, by and large, a carryover of the existing provision 1074 of the act. It is a measure which appears in similar form in the act as it was in the 1987 and 1988 acts, but was changed in the plain English version of the act which came into effect in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, there was a change in the 1991 act. It appears to be minor and has not resulted in any change in the department's treatment of income received by pensioners. However, the change, which removed the words `of income' after the word `amount' could have significant implications should the department, under pressure from a future government, choose to read the section on the basis of its apparent meaning. That meaning could be used to treat gifts given to pensioners as income over a 12-month period with a potential reduction in pension. I acknowledge that this interpretation has not been put on the section up till now, but I can see no barrier to such a move. It could even be suggested that this section could stand in the way of pensioners receiving Lotto prizes. Hence, we will be putting in an amendment to clarify this in the committee to restore the words `of income' to section 1073. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 of the bill makes another welcome change to the act in that it will simplify life for certain people who are on unemployment related payment from DSS. Doing away with people having to move on to sickness allowance if they are unable to fulfil the requirements of an activity test due to ill-health makes good sense and will hopefully reduce the stress on staff and clients alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another welcome change is the amalgamation of jobsearch and newstart. I recall very clearly in 1991 that various groups in the community thought the separation of unemployment benefit into a number of payments was an unnecessary complication. So it is encouraging to see that the government has now chosen to reverse at least part of that move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot, however, be so congratulatory of the government about the changes to the mature age allowance. It seems that schedule 6 of the bill is an admission of failure. The mature age allowance was introduced, if I recall correctly, as a temporary measure to assist certain older unemployed people during a period of crisis in the economy. It was put into place with a sunset clause to reinforce that view from the government. Schedule 6 removes the sunset clause and puts the mature age amount in place permanently. More significantly, this measure gives the lie to the government's recent move to raise the pension age for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the ludicrous situation where a woman, who in years gone by would have moved onto an age pension at age 60 and who after recent changes would have to continue in the work force at that stage in life, will now be eligible for a pseudo pension in the form of the mature age allowance at age 60. Naturally, the Greens will not be opposing this measure but we would be happier if the government would be frank enough to acknowledge the reality of what it has created here&mdash;a Clayton's pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my concluding remarks on this bill, I draw the attention of honourable senators and to anyone who may be listening that this measure is accompanied by the usual tax file number requirements. We will continue to raise our concerns about the use of the tax file number in ways which were never countenanced at the time of its introduction. It is history now that the government was taken right through the courts and defeated in the case of Mr John Malloch and has since sought to use extraordinary sophistry to satisfy its desire to make TFNs compulsory for social security clients while also satisfying the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner. While I have indicated some of our concerns&mdash;no doubt, we will discuss more in the committee stage&mdash;I wish to indicate that the Greens will be supporting this bill in spite of those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also welcome the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995, which is primarily making a number of changes to the career pension provisions of the act. We hope to contribute to that process of simplification to which the minister has committed himself. However, there are some changes which aren't welcome. I wish to comment on some of those changes and flag some of the amendments which the Greens (WA) will be putting to the chamber in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 of the bill sets out changes in relation to the Child Care Act 1972 and to the data-matching program. The changes are quite extraordinary. In the first place, the changes will enable the government to require recipients of child-care assistance to provide tax file numbers. I say `require' deliberately because the government seems less and less inclined to hide the fact that it requires people to provide tax file numbers, in spite of the Privacy Commissioner's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned often enough that the legislative circumlocutions which are being employed to keep the Privacy Commissioner at bay rate amongst some of the most outrageous displays of sophistry seen in recent times. In fact, the tax file number provisions in the Social Security Act rank alongside the government's insistence that the boat people in Port Hedland and Curtin are free to go any time they please. But let us look at the bill we are discussing here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the requirement to provide a tax file number has a potentially more worrying aspect to it; namely, the need for a provider of child care to satisfy themselves that a child-care relief claimant has provided DSS with their tax file number. I am assured by the minister's office that the department would give the child-care provider the necessary information about their clients so that there can be no question of the claimant having to give their tax file number to someone other than the department. That sounds fine, until something goes wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects about this measure which concern me. The first is the possibility that, through some clerical or administrative error, a child-care provider will be given a list of client names with their tax file number listed. The second worrying aspect is that, at some point in the future, this government or some other government will decide that, since the child-care provider already has to be satisfied about the client's tax file number, why not save the client more time and trouble by putting the onus on collecting the TFN on the child-care provider?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my reading of this bill, such a change could be done administratively with no legislative change necessary. That scenario will probably meet with derision from the government, but the framework is set in the bill already. But there is more, as they say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care recipients will be required to provide their tax file numbers for a most novel reason&mdash;so that the data-matching program can be run effectively. The TFN is being extended once again. It used to be just a means of tackling fraudulent claims; now it is necessary to make sure that another form of government intrusion can be properly exercised, efficiently exercised. The Greens (WA) will oppose these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But schedule 2 was also to have removed the sunset clause and thus allow the data-matching program to continue indefinitely. I understand that the government and the opposition have agreed to an amendment which would see the sunset clause extended by a further three years rather than abolished. The Greens will support that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum tells us that this is because the program has not yet saved the government the amounts originally estimated for it. How extraordinary! I seem to recall that, when the data-matching program was introduced, there were any number of commentators in the community who said that the government's estimates of the potential savings were hopelessly over optimistic. Those commentators have been shown to be correct time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I quote some figures to the chamber. These figures are `direct' savings. I realise that the government will probably respond by saying, `But there are lots of indirect savings which can't be measured'&mdash;the unassailable argument of those who cannot prove their assertions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990-91 the savings estimate was $65 million and the actual figure was nil with costs of $8 million. In 1991-92 the savings estimate was $290 million and the actual figure was $25 million with costs of $14 million. In 1992-93 the savings estimate was $300 million, and the actual figure attained was $70 million with costs of $14 million. In 1993-94 the estimated savings again were $300 million and the actual savings were $80 million with costs of $16 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems the government is guilty of a massive understatement when it says in the explanatory memorandum to this bill that the program has not achieved the savings estimated at this time. The estimates, we know, are becoming more modest. Over the next five years, the program is expected to save $436 million at a cost of $70 million. I think it is fair to say that the figures pale when compared with the original estimates we were given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without wanting to become too speculative, I wonder why the savings have never matched expectations and why, in the face of such failure, the government still insists on having more of the same. Why widen the net each time the data-matching program comes up in legislation? I offer two comments to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that perhaps the government thinks that by widening the net it will eventually bring about the savings it wants. I wonder, though, how many more people in the community will be prepared to put up with the intrusion and the sense of never being trusted by their government. The second flows from that and puts a question to the government: has it ever dawned on those in power that perhaps the Australian people are more honest than the government gives them credit for? Is it possible that the reason the savings are not there is that there simply is not the rorting of the system going on which the government would like us to believe exists in order to justify the intrusions that it is making?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision in the bill for a reduced reporting regime for the program is also of concern as it will lower the level of scrutiny of the program by the parliament. In light of the inability of the program to achieve the savings touted for it, which amounts to a failure in the government's eyes, why should the parliament accept a lower level of accountability on the part of the agencies involved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As annual reports will still be provided to the Privacy Commissioner under the new rules, why shouldn't those same reports be required to be presented to the parliament? I foreshadow that the Greens will put an amendment to that effect. We have other amendments. They relate to rent assistance, the guardian allowance, bank accounts and prison penalties. Because of the time, I will not enlarge on any of those except the last one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment on the note that has been put in schedule 23 of the bill which accompanies each prison penalty clause in the Social Security Act. The note currently draws the reader's attention to the Crimes Act, as does the proposed new note. The new note will make more explicit the point that imprisonment is not the only option open to the courts in sentencing. Honourable senators would be aware that this is an issue which is very close to my heart and that removing the prison penalties has become something of a personal crusade of mine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be speaking today on the Employment Services Amendment Bill. This bill is included in a group of `related' bills. I do not understand why this bill is being taken cognately with social security and veterans' affairs legislation when the social security legislation has more to do with the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 3).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) is paired in the same legislative fashion with the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill, yet they are taken separately in the parliamentary program. It might seem convenient, but I would think that if you are going to pair `related' bills they ought to somehow be related to each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will deal with the Employment Services Amendment Bill in parts to discuss the various elements of it. Part 1 includes items 1 to 5, and that is the CES notification that participants can join case management. The Greens have no problem with this section of the bill. Instead of two letters going out about case management&mdash;one letter to notify that a person has become a participant in limbo waiting for a case management place and the other letter to offer them a place in case management&mdash;the latter correspondence will be the first correspondence. This seems fine and an administrative simplification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2, items 6 to 10, relates to the treatment of seasonal and part-time workers under case management. Seasonal and part-time workers will be treated the same as full-time workers in that they will have to wait 18 months as an unemployed person before they can get access to case management services. The problem is that the part-time worker needs to be working part-time for only 13 weeks before they are knocked off the case management participant lists. There should be more certainty here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has more benefits for department statistics fudging than for the people themselves. They may still have a need for case management services to find more permanent work if they are looking for it and if that is their personal goal. It is, however, good to see that the government is not fixed in the opinion that full-time work is the ultimate goal, when it may not be the individual's goal to find full-time work, nor would it be a realistic goal under current labour market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 relates to the amalgamation of jobsearch and newstart allowances. That involves items 12 to 56. I have to question whether the amalgamation of these two allowances is a public relations exercise to cover up the extent of long-term unemployment in this country. Having two different allowances is one way of delineating who was long-term and who was short-term unemployed even if the definitions kept changing&mdash;that is, whether long-term unemployment meant either 12 months or 18 months of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to have two allowances to target special services to those with greater needs. Newstart recipients have been able to access more vocational education and training services in the past to meet their greater vocational needs. I hope the government will give priority to the long-term unemployed in its provision of staff, resources and funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a large extent case management has been a tool to provide the appearance of the creation of jobs which were really training. Case management's purpose was to move the long-term unemployed for 16 weeks into either training or subsidised employment, which took them off newstart for a period long enough for them to fall out of the long-term unemployment category. Upon returning to unemployment they would return to the jobsearch payment instead of newstart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process has the ability to skew the unemployment statistics and make it look as though the long-term unemployed are being helped. This then leaves the case management system to deal with `creaming' off the work-ready who were going to be picked up by the labour market anyway. Then the government can claim unemployment is falling and can cut huge amounts of spending from labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My last comments relate to items 20 to 22 of the Employment Services Amendment Bill. It is good to see that the government is being flexible with its eligibility criteria for a jobs compact in that people can still be treated as being on newstart if they have been unemployed for 12 months and working or training for a 13-week period. So all in all we think that unemployment by mirrors is what is going on and continues to go on. We will be looking very carefully at the bill and its consequences to see what actual outcomes result. </PARA>

It is an important change which would enable a large majority of pensioners who have left Australia without departure certificates to regularise their entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the process is conciliatory and supportive in that it assures, as much as possible, Senator Woodley, that the government's attention here is focused on the concern of the people. I understand the concern you have raised that a small number of cases would require consideration in light of the secretary's discretion in the proposed new section 121(8)(a), and that it is not open to external merits review. But the government considers that the section 121(8)(a) discretion does not require such an approach to be followed, in particular, because the discretion is not open-ended. Rather, it clearly defines the range of cases where it is appropriate to exercise the discretion&mdash;for example, where there are circumstances that are not within a person's control that justify their continuing qualification for pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examples given in the legislation provide further clarification of the situations where it is appropriate to exercise the discretion. In other words, the power has little in common with a broad discretion, and merely requires a simple consideration of whether or not the facts of a particular situation meet the objective criteria specified in the legislation. Further, the legislation also requires that the discretion be exercised only by the secretary, himself or herself. It is considered another protection, if you like; a best way of achieving fair and consistent decision making in this area. Departmental experience indicates that the external review of other discretionary powers have often led to arbitrary, inconsistent and irreconcilable decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precise nature of the discretion was developed through extensive consultation with the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, Senator Woodley, the data-matching program has been reviewed annually since 1991 and participating agencies have been tabling reports in the parliament. The present requirement to report annually and separately is very costly in resource terms and, further, the government believes it is no longer necessary to prepare such reports on an annual basis in that the reports have been useful to demonstrate the value of the program in its early years but are no longer necessary now the program has proved its worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was for this reason that the government proposed the data-matching program be amended to provide full reports only every three years, with interim annual reports being provided to the Privacy Commissioner annually. These interim reports will basically deal with financial outcomes of the program&mdash;for example, savings achieved, cancellations effected as a result of data matching, et cetera. The Privacy Commissioner's office was consulted about the proposal and indicated it had no problems with what was proposed. But the amendment from the opposition says, `Can we stay with what we have got?' and the government will not be opposing the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In answer to your question, Senator, about consultations, I have been advised that there have been a number of contacts between the department and the Privacy Commissioner's office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is not willing to accept this amendment. Prior to the amendments made by this bill, the Social Security Act 1991 provided that the secretary must waive that part of a debt that is equal to the amount of family payment that would have been payable had a person lodged a claim for family payment.

The provision already represents a generous concession, and the government does not see any justification for further extensions. If there was no limit, then it would be very difficult to retrospectively determine whether the person was entitled to the payment and, if so, what the rate was more than three years ago.

It is estimated that around 191,000 families will benefit from the $5 a fortnight increase in rent assistance, with a cost to the government of around $26 million per year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be opposing schedule 3, page 57, item 3. I will explain the reasons why the Democrats are firmly committed to opposing this item. The item relates to the earnings credit scheme. This scheme allows unemployed people to earn a limited amount of outside income without affecting their social security entitlements. It is a very good scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the government wishes once again to tighten the availability of this scheme. I noticed that a couple of speakers in the debate in the House of Representatives said that the scheme is designed to allow unemployed people who have very high levels of income for a couple of weeks to spread that income over a longer period so that their unemployment payment is not affected. That really is not what it is about. The scheme only allows a modest amount of extra income to be offset under the income test in the fortnight in which that income is earned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently only between six and seven per cent of jobsearch and newstart allowance recipients are making use of the scheme. I believe that there are a couple of reasons for that. Firstly, it is somewhat complicated to calculate exactly what the effect is going to be on a person's entitlement. Let me give a prime example of this that I gave last night in my speech in the second reading debate. I have a very good friend who completed a PhD about 18 months ago. He has been seeking full-time employment ever since. He has only been able to get part-time employment, so the scheme is of interest to him. However, despite the assurances of the CES, when he did accept a four-week casual employment position he discovered at the end of the four weeks, because of the complicated calculations, et cetera, that he actually lost quite a considerable sum of money by working over that four-week period. So you can see the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem with the scheme was one that I warned about when it was first set up&mdash;that is, conditions that we have placed on the scheme are so restrictive that it simply is not very useful for people. Fortunately, one of those restrictions will be removed by this bill, so I give a tick to the minister for that. That is the rule that says that earnings credit cannot be assessed in the fortnight where the person's income is over the income test cut-out. This would be a wonderful reform&mdash;half a tick actually&mdash;except that at the same time the government is seeking to save around $30 million from the scheme by restricting the amount that can be offset to just $50 per week. The earnings credit scheme available to the unemployed is already less generous than the scheme for age pensioners, which allows pensioners to offset up to $1,000 of income in a fortnight and which the recent ageing agendas review said should be made more generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the whole push behind the Working Nation reforms was to remove disincentives for people to take on any work opportunities available to them. This move is in the opposite direction. So it is not Working Nation that we are now really dealing with. If we place highly restrictive conditions on the earnings credit scheme, the unemployed simply are not going to make use of it. That would be a great shame. The effect of that will be twofold. Firstly, the unemployed will not take up those work opportunities which may have given them a foot in the door to full-time employment and, secondly, because of this the government will be faced with higher social security outlays. For these reasons, the Democrats will be opposing that part of the bill which seeks to limit to $100 the amount of earnings credit that can be used in any one fortnight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this amendment. Senator Woodley, I am always pleased to get a tick from you, even if it becomes a half tick in the course of your comments. The legislation before the parliament proposes a number of changes to the earnings credit scheme. They have been incorporated into a package. You cannot just look at one of these without looking at the others. There is a change over a number of things that we hope will be of assistance to people. Amending one part&mdash;in this instance, the $100 limit&mdash;has an effect on the viability of the other components. Although we acknowledge that the measure will result in savings, it also removes a number of inefficiencies and areas of criticism with the current scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important area where change was necessary was to ensure that persons who were in regular casual work should be provided with some incentive to receive a reasonable rate of jobsearch and newstart allowance over an extended period. There has been a concern that where people have the opportunity to undertake regular, casual or part-time work, they only receive, in effect, a one shot benefit from the scheme. The proposed changes will better target those persons by allowing their earnings credit balance to be used over a longer period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example: following the July 1995 income test changes, a person with an earnings credit balance of $300 who is paid at the single rate&mdash;currently, $310.50 a fortnight&mdash;and is regularly receiving $300 per fortnight from casual employment, would receive a one-shot benefit that would ensure that the person received the maximum benefit in the fortnight. For the next two pay periods, the person's payment would be reduced to $158.50 in each fortnight. Over the three pay periods, the person would receive $627.50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these modified arrangements, the earnings credit would be available to the person over the three pay periods and that person would receive three equal payments of $228.50, or a total of $685.50 over a comparable period. On those figures that is a benefit of almost $60 over those three pay periods. The difference would be caused by the combined result of the current changes to the rate and method of accrual of earnings credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes will better assist low and moderate income earners. The scheme will benefit a person who has regular earnings up to $160 because the modified arrangements will provide the person with an effective free area of $160; that is, $100 offset against earnings credit balance, plus the person's $60 free area. The losers under these arrangements will be those persons who have an earings credit balance with one-off earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The savings measure was necessary to put into effect the changes required to remove the inefficiencies and to correct the other anomalies. The cost of the earnings credit amendments included in this measure, such as allowing access to free areas, and the use of and accrual of the balance in the same fortnight, could not be covered if the $100-limit was touched in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earnings credit scheme has been modified in a way that will produce savings to the government, but at the same time will allow a person to use their earnings credit balance longer.

What the government did in terms of the l-a-w tax cuts was bring forward and increase the first tranche of those tax cuts and deliver the last tranche in this budget in the form of superannuation payments for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question also raises the issue of what the opposition thinks might be the definition of low taxation. During the period that John Howard was Treasurer of this country, the Fraser government period, the ratio of taxes to GDP collected from Australians was 26 per cent. Under us, we have become the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. What do we expect the ratio of taxes collected as a percentage of GDP to be after this quarter's figures are in&mdash;24.1 per cent? So you think low taxes are at the level of 26 per cent. Low taxes, according to our definition, are at the level of 24.1 per cent. There is a vast difference between both of us on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD's latest figures confirm that Australia is the second lowest taxed country among Western developed nations. In 1993 the tax to GDP ratio for Australia as a whole, which is Commonwealth and state, was 28.7 per cent, compared with the OECD average of 38.7 per cent. In other words, if we had the level of taxes that the peer economies to which we are often compared have on average, Australians would be paying $50 billion more in taxes than they do under the Labor government, which is a low taxing government. If we had in this economy the level of taxation that John Howard presided over, Australians would be paying $3 1/2 billion more in taxes a year than they do under us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the opposition ought not come into this chamber and preach to this government about taxation. You are the ones who wanted to introduce the consumption tax. That was the last big effort on taxation that you had. What did the Australian people do about that?

Senator Cook has quoted the Prime Minister as saying prior to the last election that there would be no increase in the tax burden, that the ratio to GDP would remain where it was at 23.5 per cent. According to your own budget papers the ratio increased to 24.1 per cent in 1994-95 and is estimated to increase again to 25.3 per cent this financial year.

One of the things you find out in estimates is that estimates are really supposed to be an opportunity for senators to question executive government, but they very rarely turn out to be an occasion when you can prove conclusively that the opposition knows absolutely nothing about the accreditation system. That is what happened the other day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions from Senator Troeth in particular betrayed exactly how she did not know anything about the accreditation system. This is a particular challenge because this is the opposition that has gone around extensively campaigning against the accreditation system and has actually spread stories and wild claims&mdash;Senator McGauran comes to mind&mdash;of banning Christmas carols, all of which are absolutely wrong and never had any substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear words about government inspectors which applied in fact to other child-care peer reviewers. And then Senator Troeth wanted to know about moderators. She gave us a quote from 1988 from one person, who is now a moderator, criticising child care&mdash;in 1988, well before the accreditation system existed&mdash;and said, `Wouldn't that person be biased in making an assessment of a child-care centre for accreditation?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had to explain to Senator Troeth that moderators are people who never visit the centres but actually make the decision based on the information provided by the peer reviewers and that they are given no information to identify the centres. It is as objective, as honest and as unbiased as can possibly be done. This was a question from Senator Troeth; some clear evidence from Senator Troeth that she certainly did not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this about Senator Troeth: by and large, when she has found out what the accreditation system is about and how good quality child care is now improving, she has not been inclined to run with misinformation, unlike other senators in the opposition who persist. But Senator Troeth did betray very clearly the opposition's complete failure to understand what the accreditation system is about and that it does not even know the process or the steps of it and certainly does not betray any understanding of how important quality child care is for families&mdash;that families in Australia do not want to leave their children just anywhere and that the question they ask first of all is about the quality of care happening within child-care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what families want, and that is why we have, with the accreditation system, 3,600 centres accredited and participating in that process, going on with the business of producing quality care, as the independent evaluation from Coopers &amp; Lybrand shows. Families like it; staff and centre operators like it. In fact, there has been a clear improvement in the quality of child care provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet you, Senator Troeth, in particular, but the opposition in general, come in here and barrack for the 10 centres not participating&mdash;which are now down to eight. We are actually making sure that our commitment to quality child care shows. We were very interested to note that the opposition should betray in estimates the fact that they do not know anything about the accreditation process but have opposed the legislation and campaigned to distort the facts about it. The process of quality in our child care is something that families love and something that this government will not shy away from.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane, let me go to the rest of it. Your Treasury spokesman, Mr Costello, has made certain undertakings about taxation to the Australian people. None of those undertakings is credible. They are reminiscent of George Bush before the last presidential election in the United States saying, `Read my lips: no new taxes.' That is exactly the level of credibility that attaches to Mr Costello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes down to it, the government has said that we will not increase the overall level of taxation on the Australian community. When you look at our record that promise has been delivered on in this term of government and it will be delivered on in the next term of government. When we take the record of governments in wide shot and compare ours to yours, what do we find? We find the figures I just quoted to your colleague Senator Parer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote them again. The total revenue collected by the Commonwealth government in 1994-95 is expected to be 24.1 per cent of GDP compared to 26 per cent of GDP when the government was elected to office in 1982-83. The government collected less revenue in 1994-95 as a share of GDP in a growing economy than the opposition did in its last year of government during the recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, with the economy in growth, where you would expect the level of taxation to mirror that growth, the level of taxation fell. Under your leader as the then Treasurer, with an economy in contraction, where you would also expect the economy to reflect a reduction in taxation, the level of taxation grew. That is the comparison to be made here. But let me go wider than that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. Minister, what, if anything, do you intend to do for small business in Queensland in the light of today's Yellow Pages small business index survey that found overall Queensland small business people perceive the state's economy as being in recession with only a net 14 per cent expressing any confidence in business activity over the next 12 months?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4048" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SMALL BUSINESS, CUSTOMS AND CONSTRUCTION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I want to draw attention to the Yellow Pages survey. As I said last week, when they did a special survey on attitudes to state and federal governments, it is a credible survey; I continue to say so. I continue to say it about the survey that came out today. No matter whether it has good or bad news, I always acknowledge that the sampling methods of the survey are quite reasonable. I do acknowledge that that survey out today did show that Queensland, as you said Senator Macdonald, for business confidence prospects in the next 12 months was the lowest, at 14 per cent, which is far too low and does indicate that there are problems with small business confidence and growth prospects in that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a national survey and, as Mr Marsden commented in his statement and on radio today, overall, small business in Australia is more confident about 1996 than they were and have been about 1995. He also says that small business does not expect to go back to the high levels of growth that they had in 1994, but are more confident about prospects in 1996 than they have been in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think, overall, the survey shows a confidence in small business that is improving. I don't beat about the bush; in Queensland there is a weakness in confidence. Mr Marsden also apparently said today in remarks that one of the reasons for the decline in confidence in small business has been the decline in population growth to Queensland from other states. I think it has also been mentioned elsewhere, Senator, that the fact that the drought does seem to be breaking in some parts of Queensland has resulted in some improved prospects for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a point of order. I appreciate Senator Schacht's advice, but I can read the book myself, thank you. I know that information. You have had two minutes now. My question was very specific. I will repeat it: what, if anything, are you intending to do for small business in Queensland in view of all that stuff you are talking about? That is the question. It is time for questions without notice about what the government is going to do. I am simply asking the minister to explain to us what his government is going to do for small business in Queensland as a result of those figures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government in a whole range of areas over the last two years for all of small business in Australia has implemented a number of measures. Through AusIndustry we have encouraged enterprise development in conjunction with state Labor and Liberal governments. That has been quite successful across Australia. I note that recently the Queensland state government announced a package of public works increases. We are about to announce in the innovation statement that comes down next week a number of measures that I think you will find, Senator Macdonald, will be more than quite useful for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> You ask what we are going to do. You will find out by the middle of next week. You will also find out tomorrow, when we introduce legislation to do with confidence for small business. One of the major issues they raise is their ability to compete with big business. We are amending the Trade Practices Act. For two and a half months the Liberal Party has not been able to make up its mind whether they support or oppose that legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer and refers to the City Link tollway project in Melbourne. I refer to comments by Premier Jeff Kennett that City Link is only viable as a project because of the underpinning provided by the federal government's infrastructure borrowing tax concessions of up to $600 million. Minister, will you concede that it is your tax system which has made tollways an inevitable infrastructure choice, given that they are extraordinarily profitable for private operators? Isn't it true that in New South Wales Premier Bob Carr could not buy out the private tollway operators because he could not afford to compensate them for the loss of these tax concessions? While it might suit you politically to try to wash your hands of any responsibility for making City Link possible, it is your responsibility, isn't it, to make sure that tax concessions which you provide are not used to steamroll both environmental and local planning processes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tax concessions we provide&mdash;and I presume what Senator Kernot is referring to here goes to the development allowance&mdash;are independent of and operate on the assumption that the particular project, in this case an infrastructure development tollway, meets the environmental regulatory standards that are required. Those standards have to be met for the project to proceed in the first place. Let me deal with the first part of the question in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the question was a bit confused. Let me spell out what the Development Allowance Authority does so that you can see that this is an arms-length transaction by the government. The Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 requires that when a valid application for an infrastructure borrowing certificate has been lodged the authority must issue a certificate if the application meets the criteria of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria of the act include the commerciality of the borrower and the borrower's corporate structure; the borrowing and use of the moneys borrowed; the ownership and the use of the facilities; and whether a law exists restricting or prohibiting the operation of other facilities in competition with the approved facility. In this case, the Melbourne City Link tollway, the responsibility will be the same. The responsibility for the infrastructure borrowing certificate process is primarily a matter for the Development Allowance Authority. If the statutory criteria outlined above are met, a certificate must be granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing legislation, the sole power for a minister to intervene in the process is where the Treasurer may direct the authority not to accept applications during a specified period. This can occur where the Treasurer is informed by the authority that the cost to revenue of approved applications has reached the limit set in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question asked of me by Senator Kernot was: do our tax arrangements drive an inevitability of tollways? It was that question or a question of some such nature as that. I do not think that contention has been made. Until I heard this question I did not think it had been made before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a wider question at the back of all of this. Australians obviously require and do demand a high quality public infrastructure to be provided. At the same time, Australians require and do demand a low taxing base in order to fund public infrastructure. So, when you have private investment heading into the provision of public infrastructure or state governments putting aside massive parts of their own expenditure priorities to fund public infrastructure, recovery of the cost of that means increasingly that we will be looking at projects where there may be tollways or infrastructure provided simply straight off the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the demand for the provision of high quality infrastructure and the requirement by the public to keep tax levels at the lowest possible level that are driving this process. This means that, where funding for infrastructure can be provided by users, that is an option that can be considered at state government level. It is not the structure of taxation that is driving it. But I do repeat my threshold point, which was in answer to the last part of your question: such a project has to meet the environmental criteria under the appropriate regulatory authority in order to qualify for application.</PARA>

Since 1983, underlying inflation has fallen from 10.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Profit share has been restored.

Like Senator Kernot's question, it relates to another body which tends to trample over the environment and local planning processes. Have Telstra and the government agreed on the network development deed which was promised by both Telstra and the government over a year ago and which sets out Telstra's plans to upgrade its network, particularly in rural and remote areas?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have advice from the minister relating to this matter. In the minister's statement of 21 September 1994, the minister said that targets would be set for the upgrading of Telstra's network to ensure upgrading proceeds on an equitable basis; priority would be given to the digitisation of exchanges and improving services in rural areas. The formal network development undertakings are one part of a range of initiatives in response to the CoT cases, many of which are either completed or significantly progressed. The other network and customer initiatives are: accelerated development of network performance standards and independent testing of network performance by Austel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister received an understanding that Austel's new end-to-end network performance standard was gazetted on 14 June 1995 and that Austel was to establish a special unit known as the carrier monitoring unit to manage network performance issues, quality of service and customer complaints about difficult network faults and related privacy issues. In addition to that, I understand that Austel has established a consumer liaison section and implemented a program of direct consultation, which now takes place through its consumer consultative forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra has also produced a customer charter detailing in plain English what Telstra's customers are entitled to expect in terms of service. As a first step, Telstra has produced a comprehensive guide to services for the use of customers. Telstra has also developed a new customer complaints and fault management procedure. The government has been advised by Telstra that relevant staff have now been trained in the new procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, steps have been taken in response to the allegation of privacy breaches by Telstra and on the CoT cases. The work on the network development undertakings that have been given by Telstra is close to finalisation. At this stage I can say that Telstra will provide milestones for the digitisation of its exchanges, replacement of the old rural ARK exchanges, calling line identification, preselection and itemised billing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the second part of Senator Bourne's question, work in relation to all of these undertakings has been taking place since the minister's announcement last year. A number of complex issues and detailed considerations have needed to be dealt with in developing the undertakings. This has been taking place in a rapidly changing environment that Telstra is operating in, which does have consequences for its business strategies. Despite this, the minister expects that the annex which outlines all of these undertakings will be released next month.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Crane this day, relating to taxation and fuel excise.</PARA>
<PARA>My question was a very straightforward one to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I asked him to rule out further increases to existing excise on fuels or the extension of excise to other forms of energy, particularly gas. I do not believe that Senator Cook once mentioned in his answer the words `fuel excise' or `tax relating to fuel'. He totally avoided the question that was asked. One can only conclude from that that the intention of the government must be to further increase existing fuel excise with the real possibility of extending it to other forms of energy, in particular gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look briefly at the record of this government in terms of its position on fuel excises during its 13 years in government. When we look at petrol we find across-the-board that that has increased from 6.155c to 33.5c per litre. That is almost an increase of 500 per cent; it is an increase of 498 per cent over that period. We see with diesel that once again it is the same situation&mdash;from 6.155c per litre to 33.5c per litre. We find that light fuel oil and top crude oil, for example, have increased from zero to 33.5c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have there been massive increases over that period&mdash;and I believe it is very close, if you work through it, to there being on average a 40 per cent excise increase per year&mdash;but also there has been a significant extension of the base as far as these taxes are concerned. It highlights very clearly that this government has decided to continue taxing policy or an excise policy that is going to hit rural and regional Australia very hard indeed. It is also going to hit very hard indeed the transport industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming to a more particular aspect of it: since November 1992, when we were told by the government that it was not going to put taxes up, we find in this instance that excise on petrol has increased from 26.154c to 33.5c and on diesel from 26.154c, or just over 26c, to 33.5c. Then we get to some real crunch times in terms of what has happened since the last election from a government that was not going to put taxes up. We find that the light crude, the kerosenes, the fuel heating and oil, the top crude oil&mdash;all fuels that are used extensively in our transport systems and in the railways&mdash;have gone from 5.425c to a massive 33.5c in just three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that highlights very much what the taxing policy of this government is concerned with. Firstly, it is going to continue to increase taxes significantly, particularly in the area of excises, and, secondly, it is going to attack that area of the community that is least able to defend its position in the ballot box. This government is going to hit particularly our productive industries, our primary producers and our mining industries. It is going to kill totally any chance of getting any real decentralisation of industry out into the hinterland or even up the coast&mdash;for example, up around Karratha in my state of Western Australia. We should see secondary industry developing up there where there is gas, iron ore and just about every conceivable mineral in large quantities that you can mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make, in terms of this question I asked today about whether the government would rule out further increases to existing taxes on fuels, is that Senator Cook did not rule them out. In terms of the extension of excise taxes to other forms of energy, particularly to gas, once again he did not rule it out. He did not even address the substance of the question. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator West this day, relating to quality assurance in child care.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, I find it quite amazing that a government member, and a minister to boot, would take the time of the Senate during question time to remark on comments given by an opposition senator in estimates. Surely there must be more pressing matters going on in family services than commenting on opposition senators? Secondly, if I need to ask questions about the actual procedures of the department, it is a comment on a system that is so complex, bureaucratic and difficult that it is hard for people to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I would also like to make the record quite straight about some of my comments that Senator Crowley saw fit to remark upon. Firstly, there was her comment that I had given the impression that reviewers in child-care centres were actually government inspectors. I defy Senator Crowley to find anywhere in the transcript of estimates one comment by me using the words `government inspectors'. It was actually Senator Crowley who used this comment. I will quote from the draft record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You asked a minute ago about reviewers. I think it is very important to place on the record a correction of a misunderstanding widely circulating that those reviewers are government inspectors.</PARA>
<PARA>This issue was not raised by me. Obviously, it has been raised by the child-care industry, by proprietors of child-care centres, and possibly by parents. Senator Crowley needs to get that straight. The industry is the one that has raised the possibility of intrusive questioning by reviewers, not the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Crowley pointed out my mistake in using the comments made in 1988 by a person now appointed as a moderator. Those comments indicated a bias against the private child-care sector. We had a discussion about this at estimates last Thursday night. At the end of that discussion about the moderator, Senator Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think your point is well taken, Senator.</PARA>
<PARA>So to some extent she agreed with me about my comments on this person and the comments that person made in 1988. I did not think she would use that exchange as a basis for a question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important point that I want to make in the time available to me is that, at that estimates meeting, some of Senator Crowley's comments on her own processes were peculiar, to say the least. For instance, I asked her about the role of advisory boards and how many of them give her, as a minister, advice on the child-care industry. I asked her:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what are the principal advisory structures in place, Minister, that advise you on child care?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You mentioned the National Parent Child-Care Council. That is all.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked about the accreditation council. Senator Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do have the accreditation council, but that is a bit of a gimmick.</PARA>
<PARA>For a minister to make a comment like that about an advisory board that is supposedly providing the professional advice that she needs to run the whole accreditation system I find totally amazing. I asked her how persons were appointed to those boards. We agreed it was by appointment, not by election. Senator Crowley also admitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very often what happens is by the time they get to me it is a sort of shortened list.</PARA>
<PARA>So the only advisory body that advises the minister is an appointed body. There is only one advisory body and the minister is presented with an extremely short list from which to make her selections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister needs to receive all sorts of advice. I hope that she will cast her net much wider in order to get a true representation of what parents think, of what child-care centre operators think, and what the general public thinks about the child-care industry rather than confining her efforts to attacking opposition senators who at least have the sense to ask the right questions. </PARA>

They are, in fact, people's lives, people's savings. They are the lives of those in families. Everything for which they have been working for years has just gone out the door.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht says that we are to have a statement next week that will fix everything up for Queensland small business. I am not sure which statement he is talking about. Is it the so-called innovation statement for which we now have been waiting for something like six to nine months?

Or is it the forest policy statement that I notice they are not going to bring down while parliament is sitting?

The building boom in Queensland of 12 or 18 months ago, when the housing industry in Queensland indicated that the number of homes being built in Queensland was unsustainable, clearly has had an effect on business confidence. All of those things are acknowledged. We at the macro level of policy setting have always said you have got to get a low inflation environment in Australia with sustainable growth. We have both.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to Senator Macdonald&mdash;you talk about Liberal or coalition governments in other states&mdash;that a number of other states have also shown some drop, which reflects the pattern across Australia, from the high of November last year. Talking of promises and commitment, I want to point out the very famous document put out in June of this year by Senator Macdonald, as the shadow minister, about infrastructure. In commenting about policy, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with proposals in infrastructure is how to give us the flexibility to campaign properly without being so specific as to lock us into particular projects which then of necessity must rule out others.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is. This is the duplicity of the opposition. They are going to speculate about the whole range of things they would want to do&mdash;to do it in such a way that, if they did win the election, they would straight after say, `There is an opt out clause; we are not going to do any of those.' Senator Macdonald stands up here and complains about policy from other parties, yet he has put it on paper circulated to his colleagues that the strategy for the shadow cabinet, for the coalition parties, is to go round with this duplicitous position of promising everything and, after the election, to find a way to drop the promise. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about small business. It is crucial to Australia. It is, of course, the sector which can provide employment for the hundreds of thousands of young Australians who do not have jobs. Senator Macdonald gave the minister the opportunity to say to small business people in Queensland what the government's policies will be in relation to small business, what they can offer. What does he do? He pulls out pieces of paper that he says are coalition policy. One day they say we have got no policies; the next minute they come in here and say, `Here are their policies.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Small business people, in the famous slogan of the Yellow Pages, do not want the minister to let his fingers do the walking; they want him to do the walking. Senator Macdonald and I spend many, many hours and days of our time walking from small business to small business. I quite often drop in to see them, to door-knock, and sometimes I ask them to join the Liberal Party. Every time this minister is asked about small business policy, he says, `We are going to amend the Trade Practices Act.' It is his great achievement in nearly three years as small business minister; he was sacked as science minister. His only achievement on small business is, `We are going to amend the Trade Practices Act to try and level the playing field between small and big business.' Well done, Senator Schacht!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is going to bring the legislation in here at about five minutes to midnight just before Christmas. He will get in here just before Santa Claus. Senator Schacht is going to jump on the roof and put his amendments down the chimney and hope that small business think that he is delivering this fantastic achievement for them. I can tell you that when Senator Ian Macdonald and I walk from small business to small business up the Queensland coast and out in Western Australia and around Australia, they do not say to us, `You have got to support Schacht's amendments to the Trade Practices Act.' They are not interested in that. Do you know what they tell us? Senator Macdonald can nod his assent if he agrees with me. Those of you listening on radio will not be able to see that; you will just have to trust me on this one. They talk to us about interest rates. They say, `Why has the Labor government put our interest rates up 20 per cent?' They say, `They say that we are a low interest rate, low inflation party.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht just repeated this absolute rubbish that they are a low inflation party. We have the highest inflation rate in the Western world. You only have to look at any of the business or economic magazines. Small business is saying, `It is putting our prices up. We can't expand because it costs too much to borrow money. We would like to employ more people but you hit us with this new unfair dismissal law.' Small business talk about the unfair dismissal laws. They do not say, `We want you to amend the Trade Practices Act.' They say, `When are you going to amend the unfair dismissal laws?' They ask us about this government that promised them low taxes, no new taxes, yet on Senator Cook's admission today in question time, taxes have actually gone up since the last election, even on their own basis in terms of percentage of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the sales tax that business pay have gone up. The petrol taxes that they have to pay when they are running around in their one-tonne trucks and business cars have gone up. All of these taxes have gone up. That is what small business is talking about. That is what Senator Macdonald asked about. He said, `Where is your policy? What are you going to do for small business?' All we can presume is that it is going to be business as normal from the Labor Party. They will stick to the policies they have got already&mdash;no change, stand on your record. Good on you, government! If you want to stand on your record, do so. Small business will judge you, and they will judge you harshly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senators Ian Macdonald, Crane and Parer in expressing concern today on the matter of secret taxes. I particularly draw attention to the government's action on the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It has relegated almost to the bottom of the agenda consideration of the Customs and Excise Legislation Bill (No. 2) 1995 and has informed us that it will not be considered until next February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is probably an extra secret tax of the order of $50 million to $100 million. It will have a major impact on subcontractors and employees in the mining industry, the offshore petroleum industry and primary industry, in limestone mining and in power generation for remote communities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, has not in any way cleared up these matters with the Australian Customs Service and has not issued guidelines for the administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. They have not indemnified from prosecution claimants who, because of the total lack of information and guidance by the Australian Customs Service, have placed themselves in jeopardy and could now be subject to major problems in the assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Senator Schacht and the government seem to be hiding on this area of secret taxes the interpretations for eligibility of both mining industry and agricultural industry activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The urgent need for immediate protection of high conservation value forests, the phase out of export woodchipping in native forests and the establishment of an industry transition strategy, to protect workers and secure their future through a transition to the extensive plantation base.</PARA>
<PARA>Many members of the public will be well aware of the significance of this issue at this point in the week and also my colleagues in the chamber are well aware that this week the federal cabinet has been meeting to consider the fate of our native forests. Of course that has aroused considerable concern within the community. That is the reason for this matter of urgency debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a vital time for forests and the outcome of the deferred forest assessment process will be announced on Friday of this week, we are told, as part of the decision that the federal government is making to renew export woodchip licences. This is really the last chance for the government to patch up its very blackened environmental credentials. I believe that the vast majority of the community is justifiably concerned that the government will not take the opportunity that is provided to it to actually take a decisive step in the protection of our high conservation value native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We seek their protection particularly from the depredations of the woodchip industry. The scale and extent of logging of our forests for the woodchip export industry over the last 10 to 15 years has increased so markedly as to cause concern to even the ordinary observer who travels, as is their usual wont in the south-west of Western Australia, to see the beauties of that unique forest area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major concern is the extent of the logging, sometimes involving clear-felling of high conservation value forests that are remaining and their use as woodchips. It is particularly ironic at a time when there is a huge stockpile of logs lying in native forest areas and alongside roads and also when there is a clear glut on the market. It is adding insult to injury to be considering the renewal of the licences for export of woodchips at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular bill that I introduced in the Senate this week actually had as its focus the protection of Australia's native forests and it deals with the issues we are discussing in this matter of urgency debate. We believe that the community is calling for the government to have the political will to protect old-growth forests, to preserve wilderness, to actually make sure there is no more export of woodchips from native forests in world heritage areas, on the National Estate or on the interim register of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly know the government made a commitment that it would be phasing out export woodchips. We have seen no evidence in that respect. In fact, if the decision goes ahead with only the threatened holding back of 20 per cent as a kind of insurance that the conservation and the deferred forests assessment process will be upheld, it means there is no reduction in the export licences, and that is a disgrace. This is a time when we were promised there would be a total phase-out by the year 2000 and nothing has moved in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People all around Australia&mdash;and I am sure other senators will raise the concerns in their place&mdash;are crying out for the protection of high conservation value forests. We desperately want those forests&mdash;the jarrah, karri and marri forests of south-west Western Australia&mdash;preserved and we want to see the biodiversity of those areas retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those areas represent the last remaining old-growth forests. Some of them were selectively logged many years ago; nevertheless, they remain our last vestige of old-growth forests. The endangered species that live within them deserve and demand protection, and they should be given that protection. We really have to ask this government to show their credentials and prove that they are willing to protect these habitats and preserve the ecosystems and the biodiversity that they maintain for us in this country. This is of national importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that people will raise this issue in relation to the south-east forests, the Gippsland, the Tarkine and other areas, but I make no apology for concentrating on the forests of the south-west section of Western Australia. Approximately 90 per cent of the people of Western Australia sincerely believe that something has to be done to prevent this depredation that has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an urgent need for the immediate protection of high conservation value forests. This protection needs to be in line with not only the Commonwealth government's reserve criteria&mdash;which I believe is outlined in the amendment that the government proposes to move to this motion&mdash;but also its commitment to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment to the Australian people was to phase out export woodchipping in native forests&mdash;not simply in those areas covered by regional forest agreements, as mentioned in the government's foreshadowed amendment, but in the areas that are the remnants of our precious old-growth and heritage forests. Those areas deserve our protection. The community has called on the government to do that and, if the government does not respond to that call, it is falling far short of what it is expected to do.

<PARA>I hope that the amendment to Senator Chamarette's motion will find favour with a majority of senators. That amended motion is now being circulated in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As amended, the motion effectively describes the parameters of the government's approach to what is a very difficult issue. I think it is very important for everyone who takes an interest in this issue to understand what the government's approach is and what we are trying to achieve in implementing what I know to very many people is an enormously complex process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have actually tried to solve the most difficult and contentious environmental issue of recent years. The way we are proposing to do this is by creating a world-class system of reserves to protect our high conservation value native forests and the biodiversity they support and also by ensuring that the forests outside these reserves are managed in a way that is ecologically sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going about this process in a very systematic manner, involving all groups in the community which have an interest in our forests&mdash;that is, the industry, the trade unions and, of course, the community groups on both sides of the green divide, if you like. We have set up a group of eminent scientists to make recommendations about what criteria should be used to establish a forest conservation reserve system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July, the Commonwealth government approved the criteria that was recommended by those scientists. The Commonwealth's reserve criteria includes the protection of 15 per cent of forests which were in existence at the time of European settlement in Australia, the protection of at least 60 per cent of all the remaining old-growth and up to 100 per cent of rare and endangered old-growth forests, and the protection of at least 90 per cent of all high quality wilderness areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we announced those criteria they were welcomed by both industry and conservation groups. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature praised the criteria. The IUCN said it is an excellent set of criteria which reflects extremely well the current art and science of reserve protected area system design. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you know, the government is currently considering a range of forest matters, including which of those areas should be deferred from logging pending the conclusion of regional forest agreements. Our objective in delineating the deferred forest areas has been to ensure that those areas are sufficiently extensive to ensure that a forest reserve system can be established through regional forest agreements and meets the Commonwealth's reserve criteria. This is the challenge that the government has set itself and it is the challenge that the government is determined to meet in this debate. The government is committed to the establishment of a world-class conservation reserve system and it will be based on criteria that have been welcomed right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be inviting all those who have an interest in our forests to compare what the Labor government has delivered in terms of forests, as on many other environment issues, with what the coalition has done or might promise to do if it gets around to telling the people of Australia what its policies are. The record of the coalition is pathetic. </PARA>

There is huge uncertainty from both conservationists and the forest industry. This government has also proven to be a champion at the export of woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that no government in Australian history has exported more woodchips than the Labor government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 all the states and the Commonwealth signed on to an agreement.

The national forest policy statement calls for a world-class reserve system, which we all support. But what happened? Three years down the track the debate is still continuing.

We do that because there is an immediate need to have protection of our high conservation value forests and there should be a phase-out of export woodchipping of native forests. Chipping was first sold to the Australian community as a way of reducing waste. It was described in that way. It has become a means of creating waste. Any material which is chipped and sold overseas has the potential to become paper pulp, at least in Australia and, of course, other material could find a better use as high grade timber produce. There is no need to export woodchips from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need to establish an industry strategy to protect workers to secure their future in the industry and in Australia. It is the Democrats' well-established priority to ensure that our communities act as communities. In other words, if a whole community values a resource and decides to protect it, individuals should not bear those individual costs. The costs should be shared, as should the benefits. Those benefits are not restricted to the aesthetic values; they include all non-wood values of our forests, some of which are the tourist, cultural and historical values and the threatened species within the forests, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the motion's expression of a need to conduct a transition to the extensive plantation base. Of course, discussion of this is very important. We need to properly utilise those plantations which are now available. There is no justification at all for importing radiata pine into Australia. I am sure honourable senators have noticed one of the longest answers ever before this parliament. On 21 November 70 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, in answer to a question of mine, are devoted to listing the source, quantity and value of radiata pine imported into Australia. We would expect that it is imported from New Zealand, the United States and Canada. But it is also imported from Latvia, Russia, the Netherlands, Norway, the Slovak Republic, Finland and India. There is no need for that. It just illustrates perfectly the need to have a real forest management strategy and a well-considered wood products industry coordination&mdash;a policy which worked for this government. We do not have that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we have seen a couple of amendments proposed to this motion on the run demonstrates the need for extensive discussion, research and information gathering. The fact that this government had not collated the quantities of timber that have been imported into Australia and presented it in a public form until I asked the question demonstrates to me that the government is making decisions not based on fact but  based on political expediency. We should be planting plantations which are unlike the rows of monospecies that we see so much of in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is growing international research, especially from Greenpeace New Zealand, but also from Europe, that multi-species and multi-age cultivations are much more robust and productive and less susceptible to the pests and diseases which affect other monocultures. This transition needs to be carefully planned. It needs to be flexible and it needs to be well advised with statistics. We also need to recognise that what is proposed by the government as a continuation of what exists at the moment cannot be defended. It has produced division and anxiety in the industry, as well as the community which is not directly involved. </PARA>

There are a range of forest types&mdash;whether they be fairly mundane, ordinary land which is often described as scrub, through to land which is shared in an agricultural sense, through to rough grazing and a mixture of agricultural and private forest types to public or private plantation types. These all require a different management style. They cannot be treated just by drawing a couple of lines on maps and then arguing about the extent of a quantum of numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to recognise that there is a range of forest management practices which range from clear felling&mdash;the slash and burn mentality&mdash;right through to what is essentially gardening of individual trees and plantations.

People have lived in those houses for years and years. The company has been more than paid, over and over again, for the value of those houses. Guess what? When those people lose their jobs, not because of the conservation movement but because of the nature of the industry&mdash;because it is using more volume of forest and fewer people, and has been doing so at a rate over the last few years&mdash;then those people's only options are to leave town or buy one of the houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that should be looked into. If industry is saying that it is really concerned about the jobs of workers, then the fact that those workers will have paid many times over for their houses should be taken into consideration. That should be part of any severance package, I believe, when the nature of the industry has caused the retrenchments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are the large companies really concerned? What is a transition strategy? I will tell you what it is not. It is not replacing export woodchips when the market for export woodchips tails off with whacking great pulp mills which will continue to rely on the exploitation of old-growth forests. I will get to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at the people who are currently working in the industry. If we are looking at jobs, we also have to look at what kinds of areas those people could reasonably be retrained in. We have to look at, as I mentioned before, where those people can live and the viability of the towns in which they live. We also have to look at the fact that a lot of the towns in which they live also have other needs for resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give you an example, the Gloucester Tree in the south-west of Western Australia has been closed. The official reason is that the tree is not safe to climb any more. Many people suspect the real reason is, if you climbed the Gloucester Tree now&mdash;which earns the local community something like $8 million a year from people who come and want to look at the area&mdash;you would be disgusted with what you saw from the top of that tree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an announcement the other day that a new tree has been opened. They have found another bit of forest which might be able to be looked at from a tall tree. In the future perhaps they will have to change to another tree. That resource, which is necessary for the tourist industry, for small business, for craft industry and for high value industry in that area&mdash;creating jobs, not losing jobs&mdash;is being taken away from those people. Those jobs are real jobs too. </PARA>

We have to talk about the real viability of towns, we have to talk about jobs in a total sense and we have to talk about resource security in its widest sense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very significant report by the Auditor-General into risk management by Commonwealth consumer product safety regulators. The Auditor-General is a very useful person and his office is of great assistance, particularly in looking at areas where there is the capacity to save taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time the opposition says that there is scope for saving money, the government asks, `Where?', in some sort of accusatory way. The fact is that there are many areas&mdash;and the Auditor-General keeps pointing them out&mdash;where money can and should be saved. This report by the Auditor-General points out yet another area. I hope that the next coalition government will take action, as recommended by the Auditor-General, to save millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Auditor-General in this report, it is conservatively estimated that annual government outlays on medical treatment of consumer product caused injuries and on deaths is between $194 million and $238 million. Clearly, here is a situation where prevention is far better than having to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in governmental outlays&mdash;that means taxpayers' money&mdash;on medical treatment of injuries and on deaths caused by consumer products either malfunctioning or doing something which they are not supposed to do. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenditure on direct treatment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is by the whole of the community, not just the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of all consumer product related injury is estimated at $1.4 billion per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Auditor says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These figures illustrate the extent and cost of unsafe consumer products. They also indicate the scope for the Department of Human Services and Health to reduce medical treatment costs through the better adoption of a risk management approach by regulators and increased leadership and coordination by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, the department could and should be doing more to cut out this horrendous bill, which is not only a bill in financial terms but also an enormous impost in physical terms on those people who are injured or, of course, who suffer death as a result of consumer product failures. The Auditor-General in the report found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . regulators&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the whole range of them: governmental authorities charged with regulating various consumer products ranging from ordinary consumer products to therapeutic goods, the Federal Office of Road Safety, the National Food Authority, the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and so on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had not adopted a risk management approach throughout the full range of their operations. Regulators are also not monitoring or evaluating their performance outcomes to ensure consumers are being adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulators usually focus attention on specific regulatory action rather than coordinated, systematic countermeasures . . . with clearly defined objectives and outcomes. To protect consumers better, they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the official regulators&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">need to adopt risk management principles involving the identification and analysis of injuries, illnesses and deaths related to consumer products; setting priorities; and designing, implementing and evaluating intervention strategies which reduce the human and economic cost of unsafe consumer products.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reduce consumer product related injuries and deaths, regulators should identify injury causes and interventions. This information is also necessary to target such interventions and assess their effectiveness. The ANAO found that all regulators need to improve their risk identification and analysis as part of their management program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a particular need for more coordinated risk identification and analysis across the Commonwealth and for regulators . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>for example&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has not adopted a strategic approach to identifying and analysing consumer product safety risks. The Bureau has acknowledged that its role `has tended to be one of reacting to injuries rather than preventing them'.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that that clearly is an area where the Auditor-General believes, and I think the parliament believes, that there is real scope for far better coordinated activity by the government. In the area of recalling faulty items, the Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is scope for all regulators to improve their monitoring and coordinating of voluntary recalls . . . The ANAO found that regulators did not encourage compliance sufficiently with recall codes or ensure that the nature of the hazard and potential consequences were effectively communicated to consumers. As a result, recall effectiveness was impaired.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only three mandatory recalls of consumer products have ever been ordered. All were requested by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. There were instances where regulators decided that mandatory recalls were necessary but were unable to have mandatory recalls ordered through the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs. The ANAO considers the Bureau should facilitate the use of mandatory recalls by all regulators to ensure mandatory recalls are ordered when necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>That strikes me as extraordinary&mdash;that over all that time these regulators have been in existence there have been only three such mandatory recalls. I might say that the business community has behaved very sensibly and you often see product recalls at the initiative of industry itself rather than mandatory recalls at the request of government. I think that is a very positive point. No doubt the need for intervention may well be limited if the private sector in fact behaves in that kind of responsible way. The Auditor-General in particular looks to the consequences of failing to protect Australian consumers. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian governments incur significant health costs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as I outlined earlier; and that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accounting for these costs has only recently become transparent as an item in assessing and managing demand for government health services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report found that injury:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.is a leading cause of death in Australia, accounting for 7489 deaths in 1992;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.accounts for one in ten hospital episodes and the average length of stay of injury patients is longer than the average of all admissions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.accounts for a higher percentage of hospital admissions (13 per cent) than either cancer (7 per cent) or cardiovascular disease (8 per cent);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.accounts for a greater percentage of occupied bed days (12 per cent) than cancer (9 per cent) and most other causes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.contributes to 24 per cent of disability in the community;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.is the principal cause of deaths between the age of 1 and 44; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.accounted for direct medical costs in 1989-90 of $1170 million, not including costs attributable to medical misadventure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found that consumer products were a prime cause of injury. A study commissioned by the ANAO . . . found consumer product-related deaths totalled 4630 in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA>So the enormous cost of consumer product-related deaths and injury to the Australian community is enormous. I commend the Auditor-General for examining this matter in the way that he has. It is another instance of those studies which do reveal that there is potential for the cutting of government expenditure, or at least the saving of government expenditure, if proper preventative measures are adopted. It puts the lie once again to the statement continually made by the government that there is no way of further cutting government expenditure. There certainly is and the Auditor-General has pointed out yet another of them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Before speaking specifically to it, I remind the Senate that this is the third in a series of reports prepared by the joint select committee arising initially from a review of the Family Law Act and its operations. Senators will recall that prior to that happening Senator Brownhill was significantly involved in urging senators, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and others to become involved in this issue, which was a significant issue in the electorate offices of all of us from the number of constituents who came to us about problems with the court, as they saw it, and about problems with the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the initial terms of reference, though, we were restricted to looking at the operation of the court itself and were not asked to look at the Child Support Agency. Of the vast array of amendments&mdash;many of which senators have come to know better in recent times as we have debated bills putting into effect some of the recommendations&mdash;one of the recommendations was that the act be reprinted and made easier to use. Considering that it all started from what was supposed to be a simple procedure, that was a necessity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recommended that we have an inquiry into the operation of the Child Support Agency&mdash;not just the agency itself but the formula that was the basis upon which the agency operated. Nobody was challenging that the legislation was sound. Nobody was challenging the fact that if you parent a child you will contribute to its support as the first line of support, not other taxpayers as the first line of support. We have presented the report in relation to the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in the first report we recommended that there be an inquiry into the funding and administration of the court, because so frequently there came up the issue of adequate funding and whether we could do this and whether we could do that&mdash;I am simplifying it of course. We felt that we needed to have a look at the funding of the court and to make some comments to the parliament about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to recognise in the chamber this afternoon Senator Jim McKiernan, the distinguished chairman of the committee when it started. The first report was an excellent one, due to the skill of his chairmanship and the way he went about the inquiry, which was a difficult one. I was sad when he left the committee to go on to bigger things. I certainly enjoyed working with him while he was a part of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular inquiry has had a chequered history. It started during the term of the last parliament, was deferred while we looked into the child support agency, and now it is completed, rather a long time since it was commenced. I recognise the role that Robina Mills played in the life of the committee. When she left in March 1994, Jane Vincent became the secretary. She has worked most diligently, having had a great deal to catch up on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claressa Surtees has been acting as secretary for the last few weeks while Jane has been away. I particularly mention David Wallace&mdash;legal adviser to the committee and of enormous assistance throughout&mdash;Matthew Mason-Cox, Susan Cardell, Jennifer Hughson and Denise Picker. This committee has gone on for a long time and has been hard worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available I can refer to only some of the issues in the report. Our conclusion is that the court is adequately funded. We base that in part on the statement the Chief Justice made in 1992 to the effect that funding was adequate to do the existing tasks at existing standards. We felt that was a significant comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the court ought not embark on initiatives without first securing funding. Mechanisms are in place for it to go to the Department of Finance to discuss additional funding from time to time. We were critical of the court's practice of overspending and of the management practices that enabled it to borrow against future funds. In the end, the view of all of us on the committee was that this year the court has been rescued by the Justice Statement. I do not know how it would have coped with its funding situation had the Justice Statement not been put down. That is not a satisfactory situation. As noted in the report, continual borrowing is analogous to a person living on their bankcard, and we have been somewhat critical of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made some suggestions about the management of the court. We were not impressed with the regional structure that has been established. We feel it is not in the best interests of the court's operation. You would need to read the whole section on management structure to comprehend that view. To just pull bits out would not create the impression that we want to leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We dealt with the area of funding in some detail. I want to deal now with an area that flows from that&mdash;counselling. We make no specific recommendations about it, but counselling is an area that should be noted. The Family Law Act implies that counselling will relate to the parties' situations in such a way that many people who go to Family Court counsellors believe they will get counselling to put their marriage back together. That does not happen and most people involved with the act know why it does not happen at that point&mdash;it is too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marriage counselling is something that needs to take place much sooner and in the community. We have suggested that that part of the counselling function be removed from the Family Court completely. I do not want people to think that we are abandoning the concept of trying to make marriages work. We believe very strongly in that concept. We are suggesting that counselling take place much more in the community and away from the court, especially at the stage when parties are trying to work out what has gone wrong with their marriage, how to keep it functioning and how to keep a home environment for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court counselling service should be dealing with the consequences of breakdown and keeping things as civil as possible by letting parties work through their grief over losing their marriage, and so on. Again, you would have to read what we have said. When we were discussing this issue, many of us agreed with Senator Spindler's comment that the bit about reconciliation counselling was probably put in when the bill was being debated in 1974 or 1975 to make the whole thing more palatable, to make it look as though saving marriages was part of the aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Saving marriages is my aim in life&mdash;so I would not want to be misunderstood on this at all&mdash;but it is my experience that by the time people go to a solicitor or to the Family Court their marriage has long since shattered. Although that might not be so for both parties. One party might go to the court and say, `I want my spouse back. I want our problems resolved.' They are the ones who did not realise early that the marriage was in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel it would be better if the legislation dealt with marriage counselling before marriage. Counselling when the marriage is in difficulties should be dealt with separately and greater emphasis placed on it. While the court will continue to deal with the consequences of breakdown, even that should be dealt with in the community far more than it has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the judicial structure of the court, we have recommended that there be a two-tiered structure. There were two tiers of judges once; we are not going back to that. We want to strengthen the role of judicial registrars. We were impressed with the work they are doing. We want to extend that and extend their authority. We have recommended that chapter 3 of the constitution be used to enable judicial registrars to have more power and to be able to deal with greater amounts of property. We have advice that that is possible. If that advice is incorrect, things might have to be done differently. But there are other recommendations of significance there. I would have a lot more judicial registrars, with appeals from their work going to the judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recommended that magistrates be much more involved, especially in country areas. Things would have to be done to enable that but we see it as of benefit to the community for magistrates to be able to do work which they cannot do at present. We recommend that the Attorney-General take steps in that direction. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to briefly address the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia</EMPHASIS>. Like Senator Reid, my thoughts went back to the beginnings of this committee, to 1991, when Senator Brownhill and I were jointly responsible for establishing the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. Little did we know that we were embarking on a five-year journey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's first report was tabled in 1992. I wish to acknowledge the excellent chairmanship and leadership provided by Senator McKiernan to the committee in producing that report. The committee, in a somewhat different structure, secondly inquired into the child support system. Most recently, it has inquired into the funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join in the expressions of appreciation to the staff of the committee, who have worked diligently and enthusiastically over the years. In particular, I mention Robina Mills, David Wallace, Matthew Mason-Cox and Jane Vincent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During those three inquiries my overwhelming impression was that this is perhaps the most traumatic area of the law in which one can be involved. The sheer volume of submissions that we received to the first report&mdash;more than 6,000 submissions&mdash;would indicate how traumatic many people in the community find this particular experience. We should also acknowledge that, when a marriage shatters, it is very difficult for the law to find solutions; it is essentially a human problem. I think we all found out that in this process there are limits to what we as legislators can do and what the law can do in remedying something that is essentially a human tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This also needs to be borne in mind when we talk about the Family Court and those who work in it. I have found throughout that, without exception, Family Court personnel devote themselves, with great diligence and conscientiousness, to a task which at all times is extremely difficult. I believe that this needs to be borne in mind, especially when reading this report in which the committee has expressed some clear criticisms about the administration and funding procedures of the Family Court. So, firstly, we must bear in mind the immense and difficult task confronted by personnel at the court; and, secondly, we need to take into account the fact that the tasks of the court were not as clearly defined in the legislation as perhaps they could have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid has referred already to the comment I made during the committee deliberations, that perhaps it was wrong to include&mdash;and it may have been a political move&mdash;the task of reconciliation in the tasks of the Family Court. This is in no way to understate that task: it is an important one and must be pursued. Obviously, the saving of every marriage is a task that we must pursue, especially if there are children involved. However, by the time people come to the Family Court, in most cases the time for that is past. If the Family Court finds that there is still a glimmer of hope, then it may be more appropriate to refer such reconciliation efforts to agencies who are directly concerned with and focused on that particular effort, rather than to incorporate it into the work of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, does not include the counselling that takes place as a particular case proceeds within the court's structure. Even in that case, I believe that the main task of the counselling is to find the best possible solution for the two separating partners and, more particularly, for any children involved in the situation&mdash;and that must at all times remain the highest priority of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful to note that the committee has stated that, for the current work the court is undertaking, the funding is adequate. I emphasise `the current work' because it is quite clear that there are areas, particularly for people in remote locations, where the court could and should extend its services. In that case, the committee recommends that the Family Court approach the Department of Finance, document clearly the additional services that are demanded by the needs of the community, and base further funding negotiations on a clear understanding of policy decisions to meet those needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also be useful to have, from time to time, regular external reviews of the court and an efficiency audit by the Auditor-General as a guide that would assist the administrators in the Family Court. I believe that some of the other recommendations will no doubt be dealt with in some detail by people in the profession and people in the court system, such as the role of judicial registrars that the committee recommends, and also the suggestion that other courts, particularly magistrates and local courts, enter the field more extensively with the support of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A separate word needs to be said for the area of mediation, which the committee in principle certainly supports, as have previous committee reports. This is clearly an area which will expand greatly in the future and may save many a court case from proceeding. However, it should be noted that the mediation field is still in its infancy. When we discussed amendments to the Family Law Act in this chamber recently, it became a matter of debate whether private mediators are adequately accredited and whether there is sufficient supervision of the work that they would carry out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister then referred the Senate to a discussion paper that addressed possible regulations that would be drawn up by the government. But on perusing that discussion paper, I have found that there is no real provision for the qualifications or accreditation of private mediators. That, therefore, remains a deficiency. Certainly in the transitionary period, until that is properly established and proper supervision is provided, the continued involvement of the Family Court would, in my personal view, be useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also made several recommendations about the responsibility for the management and administration of the Family Court. It has suggested that a more collegiate body would make it a more appropriate style of administration. That would probably be welcomed by both the Chief Justice of the Family Court and the Chief Executive Officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report to the Senate. I believe that it is yet another worthwhile step in the reforms to the area of family law which this parliament must undertake. </PARA>

<PARA>The report which I have just tabled concerns a proposal, sponsored by the Department of Defence, for the relocation of the Artillery Centre from North Head in Sydney to Puckapunyal, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stated purpose of the proposal is to meet the training requirements of the School of Artillery, to make best use of existing facilities at Puckapunyal. This proposal will provide the school with ready access to a suitable field firing range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of office accommodation, instructional and storage facilities and living accommodation. The estimated outturn cost of the project is $34.8 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relocation of the School of Artillery from North Head has been the subject of a number of studies undertaken by Defence and since 1990 public announcements by a number of Defence ministers have alluded to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally the school was to go to Townsville. With the relocation of the 1st Armoured Regiment to Darwin, facilities become available at Puckapunyal. This factor, and the large field firing range at Puckapunyal, prompted Defence to re-examine the Townsville option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further study revealed that the school could be located at Puckapunyal at significantly less cost than Townsville, or other possible locations for that matter, by constructing a number of new facilities and refurbishing existing facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal examined by the committee was somewhat different from other projects examined during the year. In this particular instance there was intense opposition to the move from North Head from local members of parliament, Manly Council and a number of community groups. The honourable member for Warringah, Mr Tony Abbott, left the committee in no doubt regarding his opposition to the move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite claims to the contrary, the committee believes opposition to the move is based more on local interests than national defence interests. North Head is a very pleasant location, but it lacks access to a field firing range. The range at Holsworthy is no longer suited for the type of training undertaken. It suffers from urban encroachment, is too small and is under the flight path to Sydney airport. It is also a two-hour drive away from North Head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training facilities at the school are inadequate. Clearly something needs to be done. The committee has concluded that for the School of Artillery to operate effectively and efficiently, it needs to be located adjacent to a suitable field firing range and to have modern, purpose designed training facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some apprehension in the minds of representatives of the local community about the future use of the land at North Head to be vacated by the school. The committee considers that much of the apprehension is focused on the developed area, comprising 15 hectares, occupied by the School of Artillery. It consists of buildings, roads, married quarters and other support infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of the balance of the land, some 60 hectares, has been assured by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). This land is either natural bushland or is on the Register of the National Estate. It will be incorporated into Sydney Harbour National Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say that they have some of the most breathtaking views you would ever want to see anywhere, looking across Sydney Harbour. It is no wonder that Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, and Mrs Bishop in the adjoining electorate and other interested local government people are so concerned about the future of North Head itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the future use of the larger area has been predetermined, a management regime will need to be developed under the direction of the Section 22 Committee. The Public Works Committee believes future uses of the 15 hectares should complement the objectives of the management plan for the larger site. The committee also believes this planning context should therefore preclude any development or adaptive reuse of land and buildings which are incompatible with, or detract from, a significant natural recreational asset on the shores of Sydney Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that these matters will all be addressed by the Section 22 Committee comprising Commonwealth, state and local government officials, which will develop a management regime for the land at North Head. Both state and federal members of parliament will be members of the Section 22 Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also pointed out that an artillery battery needs to be located with the school at Puckapunyal. It was suggested that decisions regarding the relocation of the school should await the outcome of the Army 21 study, which is examining the army's force structure for the next century. The study is due for completion in December. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The 17th report of the Select Committee on Superannuation examines the adequacy of retirement incomes policy arrangements in meeting the needs of those members of the community whose participation in the paid work force falls outside the traditional 30 to 40 years of continuous involvement. The inquiry has predominantly focused on women, as, in the main, they are the members of the community who are most affected. This does not negate the fact that some men also experience broken work patterns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to superannuation legislation over recent years have significantly increased membership of superannuation schemes, most significantly for women. However, a recent study by the Retirement Income Modelling Task Force of the distribution of private sector superannuation assets and contributions found that women had substantially lower average superannuation asset accumulations than men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the course of the inquiry it was obvious that the current superannuation system is designed for the individual with a traditional employment history, the individual who enters the paid labour force full time at the end of their education and stays there until retirement. This pattern fits most men. It is not the pattern that fits most women. It does not fit women because: women have a higher incidence of part-time work; women's broken work force participation patterns mean that they have fewer years of contributory service; and women's average earnings are lower than men's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore appropriate to ask whether the superannuation scheme as it is currently structured adequately meets the needs of women, and by implication all those with broken work patterns. The simple answer is no!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, however, was very conscious that broader community expectations abound that influence women's participation in the paid work force and that the achievement of total equality in retirement income would require changes to other aspects of society. Superannuation should not and must not be beholden to overcome the inequalities that exist elsewhere, but all efforts must be taken to ensure that the system we have in place does not unnecessarily compound them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to the committee is that the shift towards self-funded retirement may result in a two-tier society. The fear is that those who, for whatever reason, are not able to provide for their retirement&mdash;a significant proportion of whom will be women&mdash;and therefore remain on the age pension will become `second class citizens', scorned by society. It must be acknowledged that for some women, who forgo years in the paid work force to undertake caring and family responsibilities, occupationally linked superannuation will never be sufficient to provide for them in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures to reduce tax imbalance: the committee considered that some aspects of the current contribution system could be improved to assist workers with intermittent work patterns. The committee was concerned that the limited tax advantage flowing to low income earners from superannuation contributions did not encourage such contributions. The committee therefore recommends that measures which would redress the tax imbalance for low income earners be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transfer protocols, vesting and portability: the committee recognised that intermittent worker work patterns can result in a worker having a number of disparate accounts and, because of the employment periods required for vesting, the worker missing out on any employer contributions above the mandated superannuation guarantee charge, SGC. The issue of small amounts has been addressed by the committee previously but it believes that there are further opportunities for improvement. The committee makes three recommendations to improve the position of such workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that the government ensure that appropriate transfer protocols are adopted by all funds accepting compulsory contributions. Those who have read the committee's report on the superannuation guarantee charge will know that this is not a new recommendation. The second is that the exemptions relating to vesting, portability and preservation, together with all other exemptions relating to superannuation in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, be removed before the end of March 1997. The third is that the superannuation legislation be amended to require immediate vesting of all employer contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 65 contributions: some who work intermittently may wish to continue to work beyond the retirement age and currently are disadvantaged in that they cannot contribute to superannuation. The committee recommends that this situation be altered and that the SIS regulations be amended to allow regulated superannuation funds to accept contributions from persons over 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discrimination: the committee took a great deal of evidence on the issue of whether, directly or indirectly, superannuation discriminated against women. The committee concluded that the superannuation system, in most cases, was reflecting inequities prevalent in society more generally and that it was inappropriate to resolve these issues through the superannuation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, two areas remain of concern. One is the differing costs of annuities for men and women. Whilst a range of factors are taken into account in the pricing of some insurance policies&mdash;for example, smoking habits for health insurance&mdash;only gender is taken into account in the pricing of annuities. The committee is concerned that this is inappropriate and recommends that the government encourage and monitor research on the use of gender and morbidity actuarial tables in respect of the provision of annuities with a view to either amending the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to exclude the exemption for actuarial or statistical data, or declaring the gender based actuarial tables to be not covered by the exemption if it is discovered that reliance on these tables cannot reasonably justify the resulting discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of concern to the committee is the difference between the payment of superannuation assets upon death of single persons and those in relationships other than married or de facto compared to those who are in marriage or de facto relationships. The committee recommends that the superannuation regulations be amended so that those in bona fide domestic relationships and single people are treated in the same manner as married and de facto superannuants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Divorce: an area of significant concern to the community is the treatment of superannuation assets on divorce. The high incidence of divorce and the increasing value of superannuation as an asset within the family unit require that clear guidelines be determined. The committee understands that a working group has been in existence for some time, with little or no obvious results being evident. The committee is greatly concerned about the serious delay that has occurred in the resolution of this problem and recommends in the strongest terms that this issue be rectified as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education: the committee is concerned that the current superannuation awareness raising campaign,`Super: it grows on you' will have little impact on the many women who are yet to recognise the need to engage in any form of financial planning. Anecdotal evidence suggests that in some, maybe many, instances, women are anticipating that their partners will look after them in retirement. Therefore, the committee recommends that, firstly, the Office of the Status of Women develop a comprehensive educational strategy to raise understanding and awareness amongst women of the components of, and the imperative to engage in, financial planning; secondly, the government, in conjunction with the superannuation industry, should develop an educational strategy to promote understanding and awareness of superannuation which goes beyond the provision of information only and which involves active participation of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the strategy should address the needs of women, both in terms of the type of information they receive and the mechanisms by which this information is delivered. Simultaneously with the development of the strategy, the committee recommends that the effectiveness of the `Super: it grows on you' campaign be closely monitored, especially in relation to its impact on women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Female trustees: men will gain a greater interest in superannuation if it addresses their employment patterns and recognises their broader needs and aspirations. This will best be achieved by involving women in the management of the funds, in particular as trustees. The committee therefore recommends that strategies be developed which provide avenues through which women can gain the necessary confidence and expertise to participate as trustees. Such a move will also have significant benefits for the superannuation industry, ensuring that it more fully reflects the community it serves and drawing on the widest pool of talent available to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that this occurs, the committee has made three recommendations: firstly, that the Affirmative Action Agency develop reporting requirements for superannuation funds of programs that will enhance equal opportunities for women to act as fund trustees. It is recommended that these reporting requirements be ready for implementation by the 1996-97 financial year; secondly, that regulated, non-excluded superannuation funds be required to comply with current affirmative action program development and annual reporting in relation to developing equal opportunities for women to act as fund trustees in order to maintain their complying status; and, thirdly, that the appointment of female alternates be a matter upon which superannuation funds must report to the Affirmative Action Agency and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pension age increase: an area of dissent within the committee was the raising of the pension age for women from 60 to 65 years of age. The implementation of the change, to be phased in over a 20-year period, has already commenced. The major parties have committed themselves to the increase whilst the Democrats strongly oppose it. However, all committee members strongly support the recommendation that the government undertake an information program specifically targeted at those women who are likely to be affected by the change in the pension age in the coming years, which explains the change and outlines the alternative maintenance benefits available. This should be supported by an identified officer within the Department of Social Security from whom women concerned about the change can seek advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meeting the challenge: during the inquiry it has become clear that the past and present experience of women, and their capacity to provide for their retirement, is such that it would be irresponsible for any government to ignore the arguments for change and allow the status quo to continue. It has also become clear that removing the obstacles inherent in the superannuation system which mitigate against many women achieving a retirement income that will ensure a dignified standard of living will benefit all members of society, both male and female. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is aware that many solutions will be found in areas outside the scope of this inquiry. However, the challenge remains to ensure that the superannuation system that Australia carries into the 21st century is the most equitable system possible so that in future years it will be judged resoundingly as a significant contribution towards ensuring equality and dignity for all members of the community. I commend this report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is true. Let me underline not only the quality of the committee members but also the quality of the chairperson. I have said that before. I want to say it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make only two points in this debate. The first is that it is obvious that the current superannuation system is designed substantially for full-time workers with unbroken career paths; that is, people who begin work in their teens, continue with full-time work throughout their working life and retire in their late fifties or sixties; that is, still mainly men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was struck by what one witness said. The plea went along these lines: why can't you admit that the present superannuation system is not designed to meet women's needs? I do not know that that is an entirely accurate description of the system, but it certainly gave the committee cause to think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comment I want to make deals with a particular concern of the Australian Democrats about increasing the pension age of women to 65. Chapter 15 of the report, which is titled `Moving the goal posts&mdash;increasing the pension age for women', I believe, underlines the various sides in this debate. I believe this chapter underlines and reinforces the position taken by the Democrats in this debate, and that is that the pension age should not be increased. I believe the evidence given by witnesses underlines the position we have taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they did. If there is a question of equality to be resolved, and the conclusion to the chapter points out that this is the Democrats' position&mdash;and I believe the witnesses supported our contention&mdash;the pension age for women should not be raised to 65. If it is a question of equality, the pension age for men should be lowered. I say this for a number of reasons. I believe they were brought out in this chapter.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good question. That was never argued strongly by the government when the pension age was raised. They argued about a lot of other things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The participation of women in the labour force over recent decades has improved. There is no doubt about that. That is not reflected in figures for women aged 60 and over. It is not reflected in figures for women in their fifties either. I draw attention particularly to paragraphs 14.34 and 14.26 that underline this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in women's superannuation coverage also does not mean that a majority of women will have adequate cover to retire with dignity even in 20 years time. It may be that younger women now in their teens or early twenties will be able to retire with an adequate superannuation cover, but this will depend on a number of factors. It will depend on a number of current barriers being overcome. These barriers include still lower rates of pay, broken work history due to caring and child-bearing roles and the much lower participation rate of older women in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security argued before the committee that raising the pension age sent a clear message to employers and the community at large that the government did not endorse early retirement for men and women. I believe that argument is a little self-serving. There have been attempts by employers to force women to retire at 60. They have been strenuously resisted by women. A number of test cases have established the right of women to remain in the paid work force beyond 60. That is the element which has caused the change in the attitude of employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security also stated before the committee that a range of alternative income support payments exist to assist women affected by the increase in women's qualifying age for the age pension. Again, this is a little misleading. The Department of Social Security did not say that the alternatives provided by the department are at a lower rate than the age pension, lead to stigmatisation, and attract significant disadvantages such as the activity test and case management for jobsearch and newstart allowances. I have put on the record what women say about what happened to them because of those provisions. If it is necessary to provide an alternative income support system I believe that is proof that claims about equality and labour market participation are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me read, therefore, the conclusion of this chapter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee notes that the two major parties have committed themselves to the increase. The Democrats remain of the view that the pension age for women should not be increased and that any inequality should be addressed by lowering the pension age for men.</PARA>
<PARA>I heartily commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="4089" SPEAKER="Ferguson Sen A.B." NAMEID="EP5" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (5.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know there are only a few minutes left, but I want to raise a couple of matters in relation to this report&mdash;another very important report&mdash;which covers a range of issues. Particularly when we are talking about people with broken work patterns, it is inextricably linked to what has always been referred to in the past as the small amounts problem. We tend to think that the small amounts problem has been addressed to some degree. It took a long time. Many of the factors raised during this inquiry about broken work patterns reinforce some of the decisions that have been made or need to be made in relation to small amounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend the members of the committee for the way that we were able to get together and once again come up with a unanimous report. I particularly commend the work that was done by the secretariat and our secretary, Krista Gerrard, whose knowledge of the superannuation industry and the legislation and what is required is outstanding. I want to pay special tribute to Krista and the others in the secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are widely differing views amongst the members of this committee, particularly in some areas, and one of those that Senator Watson did not mention was the chapter on `Choice of fund'. I think it reflects the goodwill of members of the committee that we were able, at the conclusion of the final paragraph of the chapter on `Choice of fund', to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Committee hold strongly different views on the issue of employee choice of fund. These reflect the different philosophies of the political parties.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is fair to say that we do have different philosophies with regard to the choice of fund. But if we are going to look at freedom of choice in the context of trying to help solve the small amounts problem, we need to think not only of employees, and employees who are involved sometimes in quite large industry funds, but also of people who in some cases are providing for their own retirement by way of self-employed funds, people who these days by choice are doing some other work&mdash;whether it be perhaps doing a month's lecturing at a TAFE college or spending a small amount of time in a hospital as a resident medical officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This impacts on their own personal superannuation. Choice of funds does allow people in these circumstances to make sure that all of their preparation for retirement and all of their funding for their retirement is going into the one fund. This lessens the impacts of any fees and charges that might be levied, and it certainly does not allow any of these amounts to erode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there were a lot of differing opinions amongst the members of the committee with regard to freedom of choice of funds. I hold my own particular strong views because I believe there should be freedom of choice. A person may choose at the start of his working life to use a certain fund. No matter where that fund is, should he change jobs or should he have a variety of jobs, I believe he should have the choice to be able to keep that fund for the remainder of his working life. Currently that is not the case in many situations. That is just one of the issues that was dealt with at length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the issue of taxation was touched on by Senator Watson. I think it is very important that we see that people who are on low incomes because of the taxation arrangement of superannuation contributions are not disadvantaged by the scheme that has been put in place, because they pay an unfair tax burden on their contributions when compared with those people who are in a far better situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are two issues that were very important and were discussed at length. I am pleased to commend this report to senators because I believe it has a wealth of information which can be of great value. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The requested amendments that we are asking the House of Representatives to make relate to Meridian Investment. The request provides that those investments are deemed to be saved investments. As I explained last night in the second reading stage of this bill, the trust collapsed in 1990 and investors lost a considerable amount of money at that time. The trust has now, of course, been relisted as the Meridian Investment Trust. Since that time, investments have increased considerably. However, the gains have not been sufficient to make up for the massive losses that originally occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investments in the original trust were exempt from the unrealised capital gains rules as they were classified as saved investments. When the trust was relisted they were no longer exempt and the total gain since that time has been assessed under the income test. This has caused large reductions in many investors' pensions. The coalition indicated last week that it would be proposing requests in the committee stage of this bill to treat Meridian investments as saved investments until July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard today that the government intends to give people an ex gratia payment but that is not going to put them back into the position they would have been in if these were saved investments. I have moved the requests that the House of Representatives make that amendment for that reason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is not minded to accept these requests. The government recently decided to bring forward the well-received extended deeming measures to clients holding Meridian Investment Trust investments in recognition of the high rates of return being assessed for this investment, despite the large capital losses of investors. Global Funds Management, the managers of MIT, had asked the government to bring this forward.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by agreeing completely with Senator Knowles that those who had Meridian investments were most unfairly treated by the previous rules. The way in which their small gains&mdash;from a very low base and only a fraction of what they originally put in in terms of investment&mdash;were counted as increased gains in an asset that was treated as income. Therefore the effect on their pension was quite considerable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as we read through these requests for amendment, we understand that all former Estate Mortgage investors who exchanged their investment to Meridian shares should have their investment treated, as it says, as a market-linked investment made or acquired before September. This means that any pension or payments lost as a consequence of the unrealised capital growth assessment should be then reimbursed to all or most of those pensioners or part-pensioners.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a related matter. The social security ramifications in terms of retirement incomes have just so many tentacles nowadays. I think it is also relevant for the chamber to consider a related type matter that does not affect Meridian but affects another winding up of a fund. This will be of particular importance to members in Western Australia. The fund I refer to is known as the Excelsior Managed Superannuation Fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in that fund will be forced by the winding up to transfer their capital to another fund. Then the Department of Social Security will apply the new rules which apply to allocated pensions purchased after 1 July 1992. Those rules, if applied, will mean that the capital in all those people's allocated pension funds will be brought in as an asset for the purpose of the assets test. Aged pensioners, including those who wrote to me in my capacity as chair of the Select Committee on Superannuation, believe that the result of that action would be that their pension could be drastically reduced or perhaps, at worst, terminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it was never intended that allocated pensions would be treated so harshly in cases such as this. It is not their fault that they got caught up in a scheme which some so-called eminent chartered accountants lost control of. They lost control of certain computer applications. It was taken over by another body, but because of the high withdrawal rate the new managers were forced to wind up the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of the wind up are that the members have had to transfer their allocated pensions to a new fund and are fearful that they will lose social security entitlements as a result of this Excelsior-demise problem.

Since this issue is not an easy one, if you would prefer the question can be taken on notice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, is attending to the amendments, could she clarify what the government's rationale is for treating tax paid income&mdash;in other words, income that has been subject, say, to an interest type withholding tax or a tax paid income prior to distribution&mdash;differently to a distribution without tax? It seems to me that the government in adopting the same application to the two types of income is effectively discriminating against an investment bond that is issued by Australian friendly societies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Friendly societies have been a traditional form of saving in this country for over 100 years. They have been the repository of funds for, generally, those sections of the community that have below average earnings. I find it rather difficult to understand why a government of compassion is taxing and assessing for social security these investments in such a discriminatory way. The government has announced a series of increments to the tax rates for friendly society products. That means that they will ultimately rise above the ordinary corporate tax rate. Currently they are frozen from further increase at 33 per cent until July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To apply these rates to the incomes of low income persons is quite discriminatory, quite harsh and quite unfair. Therefore, I ask the government why it is not prepared to take into account the after tax consequences of tax paid income, particularly that income which flows from investment bonds? If the government adopts that process we would then have what is known as a level playing field. However, the government does not acknowledge this distinction; it stands condemned for imposing a penal rate on products which are held by that section of the community which does not have great financial resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would be aware as I am of the role of friendly societies. For example, they are very active in South Australia. I do not wish to see their demise and I do not wish to be part of any mechanism that sees their demise either through income tax or social security changes&mdash;mechanisms that all parties in the chamber appear to be endorsing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has anybody not got any conscience about imposing obligations such as these and saying that these organisations can encourage these people to move out of these sorts of investments? If one adopts that argument, the result will be that the investment values of friendly society products will fall if everybody pulls their money out before maturity. It is going to cause a rush on the funds and some other difficulties will follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem can be so easily overcome. I understand that the government is prepared to take submissions from life companies and also friendly societies on the incomes of their constituent members. Until the government makes its announcement on what the new rate should be and what it has predetermined to be excessive then I think it is only reasonable that these changes before us today are on a level playing field and don't impact unfairly on friendly society bond holders. In other words, the Senate should look at the after tax consequences in terms of the income which is to be deemed from these particular investment products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the minister, particularly in view of her role with community welfare issues, that she have an interest in this matter and that she look after those members of the community who hold these products and ensure that they are not discriminated against as a result of the measures that we are introducing today.

It is important to note that the recommendations from that committee report were for no change.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think you made the point a minute ago that there are a raft of complexities, confusions and possible difficulties for people. The changes to deeming mean that many of those complexities and confusions have been removed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that the after-tax consequences were fully evaluated by the committee as such. The consequences will be that some pensioners could be worse off. I am not saying that deeming is not appropriate. I am saying that in applying the deeming rules, let us apply them consistently to all forms of products, particularly those which have had tax pre-paid compared with those products which have had no tax paid at all. Otherwise you are discriminating against those products which are tax pre-paid. Keep your deeming proposals of five per cent and seven per cent, but in calculating the income which is subject to deeming, adjust for a tax rate that has been pre-paid, namely 33 per cent. That is a very simple exercise. If you would like an amendment, I am prepared to give it to you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we do not discriminate against pensioners who could be worse off by virtue of the nature of the assets they hold. I know that there are people in favour of generalised deeming and I know that support comes from wide sectors of the community. I am also aware of the arguments put to the committee by the Department of Social Security. I say to the Senate and the government that we are putting a lot of emphasis on superannuation and saving, yet we are effectively putting all our eggs in the superannuation basket. For centuries friendly societies have been a repository for savings funds in Australia and yet the Senate is squeezing out friendly societies. This legislation before us today appears part of that squeezing process and discriminates against those people who have been prepared to save something for their retirement. Let us be generous to them. Let us do the right thing. Let us look at a transitional process so that these pensioners will not be worse off&mdash;for example, those who have no immediate plans to withdraw their investments and would now become income assessed for the first time and pensioners with investments on which a loss has been made. </PARA>

I impress that you consider this question of an amendment to take into account the after-tax consequences of these particular products until July 1997. It is a simple change and will create fairness and equity. As a Senate, are we going to stand condemned by legislating against that section of the community that is least able to help itself?</PARA>

The amendment clearly states that the revaluation must occur on 20 March in each calendar year after 1996 and on 20 September in each calendar year after 1996. As Senator Crowley has said, a person can request a revaluation of one or more of the person's listed securities and managed investments and following an event that affects the relevant investments and is the subject of a recipient notification notice.

To my knowledge, this amendment is being circulated in the chamber at this stage. I will describe the content of that amendment during my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of these two bills is to make changes to the youth training allowance provisions which were incorporated in 1994 in part 8 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. The provisions of that part are modelled on the jobsearch allowance provisions contained in the Social Security Act 1991. Any changes to the jobsearch allowance provisions need to be mirrored in the youth training allowance provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these bills are to mirror amendments proposed to the Social Security Act 1991 by the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995 and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 to ensure consistency in income support arrangements. I will deal firstly with the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 1 makes amendments relating to compensation recovery which affect the calculation of youth training allowance entitlement for those who receive a periodic lump sum payment to which they are entitled under any state or territory law. In addition, they operate to adjust the youth training allowance entitlement of people who have partners who receive or are entitled to receive various pensions payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under schedule 2 of this bill, 15-year-olds who fall within the youth training allowance definition of independent are to be paid youth training allowance rather than special benefit even if they do not meet the work force requirements of youth training allowance. Fifteen-year-olds who live with parents in receipt of Commonwealth income support and have a work force history will also qualify for youth training allowance. Youth training allowance overpayments may be offset against any student assistance payments, such as Austudy, which that person may subsequently be entitled to receive under schedule 3 of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 mirrors the transferability of waiting period provisions in schedule 17 of the carer bill and allows waiting periods to be transferable across payment types, including youth training allowance, where a client changes benefits during the waiting period. Schedule 5 of the bill proposes changes to waiver and recovery of debt provisions. In certain circumstances, part or all of a debt may be waived. Debts over $50 can be recovered by withholding youth training allowance payments. There is also provision for negotiated settlements, part payment of debt and non-recovery in circumstances where recovery would be inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 6 deals with provisions relating to bank accounts into which youth training allowance is to be paid. The rent assistance threshold for youth training allowance clients is increased by $5 under schedule 7, and there are further minor amendments under schedule 8. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 3): schedule 1 of this bill contains amendments to the way in which deeming rules apply to investments held by recipients of the youth training allowance. Schedule 2 eliminates the need for recipients of the youth training allowance to transfer to sickness allowance if their period of sickness is more than 13 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 will allow a person to access earnings credits notwithstanding that the person's ordinary income amount would, if the income test were applied, reduce the rate of assistance to nil. The earnings credit scheme operates to provide an incentive for a person to undertake part-time or casual employment. Schedule 4 removes redundant references to jobsearch allowance from the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. As I have indicated, the coalition will not be opposing these bills. However, I move:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">", but the Senate condemns the failure of the Government's measures to assist young unemployed people".</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make some comments as to the reasons why the coalition has moved that amendment. During the last 13 years Labor and the federal government have comprehensively failed Australian youth. Youth unemployment at the national level of 29 per cent is unacceptable. It is obvious that the policies pursued by the Labor government over the last 12 years have failed to address the youth unemployment crisis in any effective way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just seen the third consecutive rise in the unemployment figures. Unemployment now stands at 8.7 per cent and 787,000 people are out of work in Australia. This number does not include the 106,000 discouraged job seekers who miss out because they are not actively looking for work because they do not expect to find any. It does not include the 177,300 parents who want work and are otherwise available, except that they cannot get appropriate child care. It does not include the 82,200 unemployed people who are sick or otherwise prevented from actively looking for work in the survey week. It does not include the 140,000 people who want work and are available but are in TAFE, or university or training and were not actively looking for work at the time of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When all these people are taken into account, 21 per cent of Australians&mdash;one in five&mdash;want more paid work than current policies are able to provide. There are approximately 85,000 people in subsidised employment at any one time under government programs such as jobstart, new work opportunities and so on&mdash;perhaps half of whom will be back on the unemployment queues when the subsidy runs out. Youth unemployment in particular is at the highest rate since Working Nation commenced 16 months ago. The national rate is 29 per cent, and in some areas it is almost double that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately the youth training allowance is not doing anything to assist young people to find and keep jobs. In September 1995, 292,600 people between the ages of 15 and 24 were looking for work and unable to find it. Working Nation has been a failure. It has added to the national training reform agenda with its bureaucratic and complex arrangements such as the youth training initiative, the youth training allowance, NETTFORCE and the national training wage&mdash;the so-called centrepiece of the white paper. Further to this we must add increased targets for entry level training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gulf between the government's rhetoric and its achievement is vast. The Australian traineeship system, with its target of 75,000 traineeships per year, would seem to have been invented. Its targets have never been met. Numbers never got much above 15,000 people and usually hovered around 9,000. The latest OECD figures show that Australia has the second lowest proportion of young people of upper secondary age in vocational education or apprenticeships of any OECD country. For a nation with our resources and our comparatively highly educated population, that is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation set a target of 26,500 trainee commencements for the first year and achieved only 16,000&mdash;less than the target for the previous year. Even though apprenticeship numbers have started to climb, although very slowly, in 1995 Australia had the lowest number of people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force for three decades. It is doubtful whether the unimpressive target of 34,000 traineeships in 1995-96 will be reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has ensured that formidable obstacles are placed in the path of addressing the problem of youth unemployment. It has insisted on linking the training agenda to the industrial relations agenda, and the national training wage is the prime example. The bureaucratic complexity and the top-down approach of the national training reform agenda has been driven by bureaucracies and their rivalries rather than by training needs, according to the ACCI. The system again has developed its own dynamics, remote from industry needs and the needs of employers, and assessment arrangements are still not in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people in Australia today are being ignored by Labor and ignored by the federal government. Under these bills they are being shuffled around. The real problems and causes of youth unemployment are not being addressed. It is all very well to take a little bit off one allowance here and add a little bit on in another place, but real jobs are not being created, and real jobs are what young people want. Youth unemployment is devastating for the individual. It constitutes an unacceptable loss of energy and motivation to the wider community and it threatens to destroy confidence and faith in our society amongst a whole generation. These are the reasons why I have moved the amendment on behalf of the coalition. </PARA>

These bills are the DEET duplicated version of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995, making changes to the youth training allowance in line with the changes to jobsearch through DSS legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) 1995, our major concern is schedule 7. That schedule raises the rent assistance threshold by $5 to cut off more people from receiving rent assistance. The Greens oppose this government proposal. Our financial arguments are sound enough without looking at the moral consequences of raising a rent threshold by $5. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum admits that, while the administrative cost of raising the threshold by $5 will be $60 million over a three-year period, the increase will save the government $65 million in the long term. Whoopee-do! The government is undertaking a lot of work for little financial return and, along the way, causing much hardship to the poor in our society, because $5 does make a difference to your earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not deny the fact that the youth training allowance is below the poverty line and rent assistance is sometimes the only hope for people to be able to survive in rented accommodation. Why should people have to pay more in rent to get assistance from the government? Why should people who are trying to cut their rent by sharing with more people be penalised by not being eligible to receive rent assistance? Rent assistance can be the difference between living in debt and surviving on an allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, how can the government justify giving rent assistance&mdash;which could be up to $30 a week&mdash;on the basis of a $5 difference in two people's rental bills? This is hardly targeting money to those who need it the most, which is the government's usual justification. This amendment will not result in any increased fairness.

<PARA>The NBEET report prepared by the Employment and Skills Formation Council is a very timely and comprehensive document. It focuses on the identification of skills and on properly preparing for the new information age, the so-called information superhighway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has been tabled so that NBEET could provide input into the government's national strategy for information and communication services technology. I found a number of the specific recommendations very constructive and commendable. If implemented, they should go a long way towards skilling people to use information technology effectively in education, in the work place and for leisure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 9 relates to a system called EDNA, the educational network in communications. It is recommended that this model involve a combination of Internet, Artnet, and Open-net and that it be used as a major vehicle for connecting education and training institutions to ensure cost effective access to services by individuals and community groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NBEET council has rightly pointed out that recent proposals to establish EDNA will ensure that most Australians get very quick access to this new information technology. This approach should stimulate the use of electronic networks across schools, TAFEs and other higher education institutions by students, teachers and lecturers. Such a development, as I am sure everyone will appreciate, is most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 11 calls for libraries to adopt a common information retrieval and cataloguing service system. This common service, the Australian bibliography network and school catalogue information service, is to be implemented by 1997 for all education and training institutions and libraries. The extension of this common service to community libraries is recommended to be implemented by 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A standardised service approach is a vital decision for access to and distribution of the wealth of public libraries across Australia. As a member of the Council of the National Library of Australia, I welcome this particular development because it will link these information powerhouses and give people, even in small local communities, access to the vast store of intellectual wealth that exists in our public libraries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 14 sets as an objective that all schools by the year 2000 achieve a ratio of one multi-media capable computer for every three computers. It further recommends that there be a minimum of one computer per five students in schools, subject to various equity and disadvantage considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report underlines the need to provide sufficient infrastructure to educational institutions, particularly schools, to promote access to information technology and learning. Last year when I was overseas looking at how the information superhighway was developing across America, I was very struck by the fact that, with their infrastructure development and what was available in hardware and software in their schools system, they were nowhere near the level we are at in Australia. We have a great advantage here. It is a great thing that we have developing in this country a much better access on the information superhighway for our young people than they have in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, recommendation 20 highlights workplace learning which has been funded with Australian industry on a comprehensive basis to speed up the skilling of workers. We have seen the failure of the One Nation program in this country, and there needs to be a real alternative to this. It is felt that the way it is proposed for training to be gained and workplace skilling to come directly to the workplace might go some way towards that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These major recommendations that I have mentioned so far are signs that Australia is heading down the right track on the information superhighway. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make a few brief comments on the report of the Federal Race Discrimination Commissioner, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the nation&mdash;A report on people of non-English speaking backgrounds</EMPHASIS>. This quite lengthy document of some 331 pages is worthy of a read, and I commend it to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 82 and the following pages have a very interesting section dealing with trade unions. At the bottom of page 82 we see the statement of a Mr Jock Collins who in 1991 wrote a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migrant hands in a distant land&mdash;Australia's post-war immigration</EMPHASIS>. In that document he came to the conclusion that recruitment of immigrant members was for little else than to increase union revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That statement is very much akin to the activities of a certain Labor senator in the state of Victoria who has been using immigrants for the purposes of branch stacking within the Victorian division of the Australian Labor Party. Unfortunately, the use of immigrants to stack out trade unions for membership or for Labor Party purposes in factional brawls simply demeans the role of the immigrant within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noteworthy that in the federal seat of Batman, which has a very strong representation of immigrants, an ethnic candidate and a female candidate were up for endorsement by the Labor Party. However, they were both overridden so that Martin Ferguson could be endorsed as the Labor candidate because his trade union credentials were a lot more important than any aspirations of the ethnic community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, indeed, goes on to say that even as recently as 1977 some unions were engaged in a closed shop arrangement that effectively excluded immigrant workers from employment in certain industries. I also recall how certain of the trade union elements, after peace had been achieved following the Vietnam war, took a very strong stance in relation to accepting Vietnamese refugees into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 83 of the document tells us that, as overall trade union membership has declined in recent years, so too has trade union membership of immigrants of non-English speaking background; it went from 53 per cent to 44 per cent between 1986 and 1992. The general trend of decrease in trade union membership which has been reported in this document also indicates that there has been a general decline in the relevancy of the trade union movement to the workers of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to say that, nevertheless, immigrants of non-English speaking background had higher trade union membership rates in 1992 than immigrants from an English speaking background. Clearly, I would have thought that that would be a clear reason for ensuring that the workers of this country were provided with adequate language skills&mdash;they then could fully understand what the trade union movement was all about. It is quite clear that those who have a full command of the English language are less likely to join the trade union movement than those who do not have such a command of the English language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to say that 30 per cent of workers of non-English speaking background felt discriminated against in trade union elections. So the next time the ACTU and the ALP strike another accord between themselves, they might like to take into account the very real and sorry plight of immigrant workers in this country which has been so overlooked by both the ALP and the trade union movement. I commend the basics of the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to speak on this report, but I think I should put some facts fairly straight and on the table. To my knowledge, from my 20 years in the trade union movement and from observations I have made&mdash;and I hesitate always to talk about 100 per cent of people having a certain view&mdash;certainly the policies that many of the trade unions have had in place have gone to the question of defending the rights of immigrants who have not had a good command of the English language. If one looks at the clothing trade, for example, where most of the outworkers are women who do not have a command of the English language and who are paid very low rates, there has been a need and an acceptance by the trade union movement of their role in defending the rights of these people and seeking wage justice and reasonable conditions of work for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the metal industry unions, from my own experience with them, have always held the view that every person within their ranks, regardless of their ethnic background, has every right to have a say in the development of policy; that they have the right to be assisted and enabled by the unions to rise to positions of influence in the unions&mdash;senior official positions of a full-time nature. That has been my attitude and it is the attitude I have observed of many people in the ranks of the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike some people on the other side who might wish to say that everybody is either good or bad, I do not question or deny that there would be people in the trade union movement who, because of their basic attitude and experiences, could be racist in their behaviour; they could be opposed to the idea of immigrants to this country getting jobs that they may have preferred go to other people. But I would be as critical of those people as anybody else in the community. I think it is pretty unfair of people like Senator Abetz to get up here and try to paint the whole of the trade union movement in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union movement has been responsible for defending workers with ethnic backgrounds who, over many years in this country, have been disadvantaged by greedy employers. Indeed, they have policies whereby they ask the government and employers to introduce English language programs; they negotiate to have English speaking programs included in their award rights. It is very clear that the trade union movement has played a very good and constructive role in this particular area and that it will continue to do so, while people like Senator Abetz want to be negative and dishonest in accusing people of having a particular attitude. </PARA>

<PARA>I welcome the opportunity to take note of the annual report for 1994-95 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. In 1994-95, AWRAP was integrated with the International Wool Secretariat to form a customer oriented international marketing and research organisation. Its goal was and is to build a sustainable demand for Australian wool by ensuring that wool and wool products satisfy our customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With trade barriers collapsing and an increasingly fierce level of competition in the textile industry, it is imperative to have a strong organisation focused on looking after the interests of wool promotion and wool growers. After the turbulence the wool industry has experienced in the past few years, it is stability and commitment to succeed that we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing the activities of the now merged organisations for 1994-95, there are many notable achievements. AWRAP's research and development was more closely aligned with customer needs, while the IWS launched a $70 million international Woolmark advertising campaign in Australia and for the first time more than 3,000 firms paid a Woolmark licence fee. An annual fee is now paid by spinners, weavers and garment manufacturers wishing to use the IWS's certification marks, Woolmark and Woolblendmark, on their products. These trade and identification marks rate with such notable product identifications as the three-pointed star for Mercedes and the golden arches for McDonald's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report notes, this is a clear indication that the Woolmark is the most widely recognised apparel symbol in the world. Chairman Mac Drysdale goes on to note that the acceptance of the licence fee has brought added commercial discipline to the organisation to perform in a way that benefits both licensees and growers. It was unfortunate that New Zealand did not see fit to remain a funding partner of the International Wool Secretariat, and that decision may cost our Tasman neighbours dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Realisation and Promotion Organisation is the body that has the responsibility to receive and spend the compulsory industry levy, which is 8 1/2 per cent, of which 4 1/2 per cent goes to the disposal of the stockpile as administered by Wool International. The remaining four per cent goes to AWRAP, and 3 1/2 per cent of that is spent on promotion and one-half of one per cent is spent on research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two ways to sell more wool. One, of course, is to have substantially reduced prices, which over the last five years has not worked very well. The second is to promote the product, and to promote the product you have to both market it in the sense that you promote it with advertising funds, but you have also got to have forward selling methods that spread the risk so that growers alone are not bearing all of the risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the actual promotion of the product&mdash;and that is what AWRAP is involved in through its compulsory industry levy&mdash;when the price fell the amount that was recovered by AWRAP to be used for promotion fell, and it has been very pleasing to see the price rise in 1994-95. Of course, it has slipped a little now, but that made it possible for a larger contribution to be made in the form of the advertising campaign which is quite evident now. The promotion and research component is very important too and vital to be maintained. </PARA>

<PARA>Wool International was born from the former Australian Wool Realisation Commission in December 1993. As a statutory authority, Wool International is committed to disposing of the stockpile, enhancing the long-term viability of the wool industry, and repaying the government-guaranteed debt. The act under which Wool International was established confers on the organisation a responsibility to encourage forward selling mechanisms for risk management, amongst other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To prosper and indeed survive, the industry must hasten its introduction of risk management techniques for both wool growers and buyers. The market must move away from its near total reliance on the auction system. After 150 years of wool being grown in this country, we still have about 85 per cent of growers accepting a spot price&mdash;in other words, they put their whole 12 months of production up on the day and take it&mdash;which, of course, is subject to enormous variations in price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the interests of both growers and buyers to have a more sophisticated risk management system. Although forward contracts or forward trading frightens growers because it is something they do not understand, it is essential for the future of the industry. The auction system will remain, but there must be more choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut proposals overall have worked extremely well in reducing the stockpile and also reducing the debt. I believe that, regardless of the role of Wool International and the stockpile in recent months, there would still have been a correction in prices because China has not been active in the market. The crucial missing factor is market confidence. Once that is restored, textile activity will lift and prices will begin to rise again, led initially by fine wool, which will be most affected by the reduced availability in 1996 if the drought continues to break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish Wool International the best as it readies itself for privatisation, which will occur after 1 July 1997. The options for a privatised Wool International would have to provide choice to growers. Until these recent price falls, the future role of Wool International had really risen to unrealistic levels in the industry because it had been so successful. I think we must put it in perspective; it will be two years before Wool International is out of debt&mdash;in other words, in 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently there are 2.9 million bales in the stockpile and a debt resting on that of $1.6 billion. At the continued sale of 185,000 bales a quarter at the end of selling season 1997-98, there should be an approximate net worth of $1.4 billion which will be returned to growers, in whole or in part. In a new privatised body, perhaps in the form of a public company, the two requirements are that it must be able to provide a service to growers and it must be able to charge for those services&mdash;in other words, make a profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, any privatisation at the end of 1997-98 must focus on shareholder value and must provide a choice to growers, and there must be alternatives provided to the possibility of 100 per cent liquidation of the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International will be judged by the new role recently announced last week or the week before by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins). Wool International Holdings will source buyers overseas, give depth to the futures market, which is at present underutilised and undercapitalised, and will provide a new choice to growers. We need a way of removing the risk that is presently solely held by growers and the new futures contract and selling proposal under the auspices of Wool International will provide a motivation for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I briefly say in connection with Wool International that the new board is about to be announced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a point Wool International has done a remarkably good job in getting the stockpile down to now under 3 million bales and the debt down to somewhere in the order of $1.5 billion. But I believe that their policy of forward selling and what appears to have been a downward pressure on the market in the last three or four months have not necessarily been in the best interests of woolgrowers. I think that they should have shown more flexibility in the way that they managed the sale of the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there was a case for limiting that forward selling and getting it back into the current quarter to take some of the pressure off the depressed prices that occurred. I think that is the one blight on their performance to this time. I would certainly hope that, between now and the start of the autumn selling season and going into next year, the board of management will take into consideration the points I have raised that woolgrowers and industry representatives have raised with me. I believe, from the support that is being shown by senators at this time, that they support us as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think the minister should take a firm stance. In saying that, I am not being critical at this stage of him. He still has the opportunity to do that prior to the next part of the selling season, but wool has been depressed to a point now where it is as low as it was two or three years ago. I do not think Wool International has been able handle the market depression for a number of reasons, not the least being what has occurred in China, which has dumped some 200 million kilos of extra wool on to the market in Western Europe as well as in China. This has never before occurred in the history of wool marketing in the world. I believe that is one of the most significant factors. Wool International should have been aware of the potential of that and they should have reacted in a totally different way to handle that problem. </PARA>

<PARA>With that statement and other statements to that effect, it is worth while to reflect that Mr Keating's consumption taxes, including the wholesale sales tax, the petrol tax, excise and import duties, now provide to the federal government coffers $30,700 million in revenue. What would John Hewson's GST have produced? Only $23,000 million. Paul Keating and the Labor government's indirect tax regime are now collecting an extra $7,700 million out of the pockets of those lower and middle income earners that Mr Keating acknowledged are worse off under an indirect taxation regime. </PARA>

They will go out and sell a message condemning what the coalition will do and then they will do that, but a lot worse. They won government at the time on the basis of opposition to the GST because of how regressive it would be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's campaign of scare on a whole range of issues has been highlighted in recent times by the leaked document from the South Australian trade union movement which indicated quite unashamedly the Labor Party's tactic at the next election. They will run `with a fear and loathing campaign on individual contracts'. Then they have to define the scope, et cetera. That is unashamedly in a published document that was memoed to union secretaries headed `1996 federal election campaign'. That is the strategy that the trade union movement will engage in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia are on notice, whenever the ex-trade union officials from the ALP get up in this place, whenever they try to hold their little rallies, whenever they issue a media release: do not consider that what is being spoken or promoted is the truth. It is a very cynical and deceitful campaign of fear and loathing being engineered by the trade union movement, in cahoots with the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document that is before me is six full A-4 pages and details the trade union strategy which, when you read through it, is identical to the dishonest strategy employed against the GST at the last election. It is exactly the same strategy, but this time they will concentrate on individual contracts as opposed to the tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia ought to remember that when the Labor Party ran such a campaign in relation to indirect taxes the people ended up paying an extra $7,700 million in indirect taxes, for swallowing the fear and loathing campaign engineered and run by the Labor Party and the trade union movement. The workers of this country can also be assured that if they swallow the fear and loathing campaign promoted by the trade union movement on individual contracts the workers undoubtedly will be worse off, exactly the same as they are worse off under the indirect taxation regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember when I was promoting the concept of enterprise bargaining and individual contracts in Tasmania. I was absolutely vilified by certain elements of the trade union movement who said that the contracts were code for saying, `Slave labour. People will be earning less.' That was the Labor Party message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find in Weipa now? The trade union movement is opposed to individual contracts. Why? Because the workers on those contracts are earning thousands of dollars more per annum than workers who foolishly remained under the award system. Once again they have that campaign of fear and loathing and vilifying the person by saying, `It is slave labour.' Yet when you look at it, those workers on individual contracts are far better off. That was the Labor Party tactic at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have proof positive that it will again be their strategy at the forthcoming election. I trust that the people of Australia will not fall for the same trick twice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address some comments tonight to a matter of extreme concern to my constituents back in the state of Western Australia, particularly to those constituents who live within the boundaries of the city of Wanneroo. The city of Wanneroo now has national prominence in Australia because of what is known as Wanneroo Inc. It is not a name that I subscribe to because, by implication, Wanneroo Inc. implies that all of those councillors who have served, and continue to serve, on the council of the city of Wanneroo have been or are involved in some criminal activity. </PARA>

Another councillor has not long since been released, also after being convicted of official corruption. Indeed, it is expected that more people will be convicted in the future and will also serve prison terms. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an inquiry set up by the West Australian government. It is known as the Kyle inquiry because its chair is an eminent citizen, one Mr Peter Kyle. It has commenced taking evidence. The first witness to the Kyle inquiry into Wanneroo Inc. has been none other than the former mayor of Wanneroo, the person recently convicted of official corruption, who is now serving a prison sentence for that crime. He has been the first witness. He has provided to the people of Western Australia&mdash;indeed, to the people of Australia because it is now an event of national importance&mdash;categorical evidence of why there ought to be a royal commission into the affairs of Wanneroo Inc. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I say that is for what has not been published. Mr Kyle, in order to protect individuals who may be implicated in Wanneroo Inc., has had to order that the names and certain events not be published. The reason for that is that the inquiry is being held under very limited terms of reference. This is not something new or unique to Western Australia, but this particular inquiry has very limited terms of reference. It is being held under the Local Government Act of Western Australia. The inquiry allows no protection whatsoever and no privilege to any person who wants to come forward and give evidence about the corruption that occurred within the city boundaries of Wanneroo over quite a period of time. </PARA>

The really unfortunate part about that is that, as I said in opening, a lot of innocent people who have faithfully served the people of Wanneroo, and indeed the people of Western Australia, at great personal cost to themselves on the council of Wanneroo are all being smeared because there have been some corrupt individuals who served on the council. Of course, we may not be able to get to the bottom of this unless there is some protection and privilege given to the people who do want to go forward and give evidence to the inquiry and, hopefully, that would cleanse the council and lead to further convictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that a state such as Western Australia is hiding and running away from such an inquiry. What have they got to hide? There must be something to hide if such an inquiry is not going to be held. That question was answered this afternoon in the other place, when the local member for Moore, Mr Paul Filing, stood up in the House of Representatives and made a speech and named quite a large number of people who are, and continue to be, involved in the corruption that has gone on, and perhaps is still going on, within the boundaries of the city of Wanneroo. I am not going to refer to all of the names here tonight. I do refer and commend people to the speech of the local member of parliament, Mr Paul Filing, and I ask them to read it with great care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Mr Filing's speech and with other matters that have occurred within the Kyle inquiry, I think the pressure is upon the Premier of Western Australia, indeed the government of Western Australia, to broaden the terms of reference to provide for a royal commission to get to the bottom of the corruption that has occurred in the city of Wanneroo, and it is going to reach a position where the government will not be able to afford it. Mr Court may have a lot of very important people that he seeks to protect on the way through. Some of the people may serve in his own parliament; some of the people who were named in the House of Representatives today are actually currently members of the Western Australian parliament, and I am not just talking about one or two people, there are more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that, unless the terms of reference are broadened, we will not get to the bottom of it without a royal commission, but I think that one is certainly coming. The weight of public opinion is such that the government, in order to save itself in the finish, will just have to bow to the will of the people; will have to open up the inquiry; and will, in turn, expose those people, including some very senior people in the Western Australian government, to the possible charges that will, I believe, inevitably arise from the report of such a royal commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was part of the Senate select committee which examined unresolved whistleblower cases. This all-party committee delivered a unanimous report, and many of the senators involved have addressed the Senate expressing their further concerns. Unfortunately, the matters we have raised have fallen largely upon deaf ears, particularly within the state of Queensland, which I represent. As a committee, we have raised serious matters of public concern which go to the very heart of the administration of justice. These matters are not limited to Queensland and ought to be of national concern, although it has been appalling to witness the enormous number of complaints which have emanated from Queensland itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, our committee was unable to address the majority of complaints due to the limitation of resources, time and limitations as to our jurisdiction. Although the committee was unable to examine the vast majority of submissions from these people, I have read many of them and met personally with some to hear their cases in more detail. It is evident that many people in Australia have legitimate complaints which are not being listened to nor being addressed. Politicians and bureaucracies unfortunately have frustrated and even whitewashed some of these complaints. Ultimately, the responsibility for these actions must rest with the state ministers who have been alerted to these wrongdoings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one case examined in detail by our committee, two former police officers, Reynolds and Harris, had their careers ruined because they tried to act on evidence they had which indicated serious misconduct within the senior ranks of the police service. Reynolds and Harris acted in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Fitzgerald report, but unfortunately the police service, the Criminal Justice Commission, the Director of Prosecutions and the Attorney-General all failed to ensure that these two officers were not penalised for doing their duty.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Such a statement is clearly disingenuous. Indeed, in the case of whistleblowers Reynolds and Harris, correspondence proves that the premier, the then Attorney-General, Dean Wells, and the police minister, Terry Mackenroth, were all aware of the serious allegations against former Detective Superintendent Huey. This was many months before Reynolds and Harris received the complaint against Huey upon which they acted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former police minister Mackenroth, after having read a 30-page memorandum of advice prepared by the Director of Prosecutions and dated 27 August 1990, caused Huey to be removed from the police service. Unfortunately, this occurred in a way which benefited Huey and damaged the whistleblowers. The other ministers, the CJC and the police service have hidden behind the director's advice. Our committee read this  advice and has unanimously recommended its public release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recommendation was not made lightly, but when all competing interests were weighed, justice demanded its release. The public release of this advice is necessary not only for what it contains but also for what it failed to address. I believe if this matter were properly investigated, as Reynolds and Harris sought, the advice would have come to a different conclusion. These matters have been well addressed in the supplementary submission to the committee by Robert Butler, dated 25 May 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of adopting the course recommended by our committee, the advice has been selectively released and misleadingly used in the prosecution of Harris. This prosecution amounted to an abuse of process in order to silence an effective critic, a public minded whistleblower. Relevant evidence supporting Harris's case was withheld from the courts during his prosecution. This was to his detriment. Such inexcusable and indefensible conduct is a matter of the gravest concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than addressing these issues, the premier has whitewashed these matters by accusing the Senate of holding inquiries for political purposes. When making his accusation, the premier failed to recognise that the committee was chaired by a Labor senator and that all five parties of the Senate participated in this seven-member committee. The premier appears still to be shooting the messenger&mdash;namely, the Senate committee&mdash;rather than dealing with the real issues involved. In fact when Senator Murphy, as chairman, tabled our committee findings, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the matter of Gordon Harris and John Reynolds, it is clear to me that the actions taken against Mr Harris and Mr Reynolds demonstrated a classic whistleblower dilemma whereby the whistleblower, rather than the disclosures, becomes the focus of attention. The investigations, court cases and appeals to which Mr Harris and Mr Reynolds have been subjected boiled down to Mr Harris being found guilty of disclosing information contrary to the Police Administration Act&mdash;an offence determined by a magistrate to be so trivial, and with such mitigating circumstances, that Mr Harris was discharged without having a conviction recorded. It was the committee's view that the severity of the reprisals to which Gordon Harris and John Reynolds were subjected could not be justified and I believe the state should consider some form of compensation for these two people.</PARA>
<PARA>All members of the committee were in agreement with this statement. Justice and honesty demanded this finding. Although a member of the Australian Democrats, I was one of many Queenslanders who worked hard to ensure a Labor victory in 1989. I believed that change was essential to ensure that real reform could be achieved. To suggest that I am disappointed is an understatement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also supported as a pivotal reform the establishment of the Criminal Justice Commission, which held out real hope to Queenslanders. Unfortunately, it also has thus far failed to live up to our expectations. Our committee was appalled by the ferocity of the CJC's attack upon whistleblowers. The CJC appeared incapable of admitting or even acknowledging a wrong. Rather than adopting such a position, even when blatantly obvious, the CJC went to extraordinary lengths to discredit whistleblowers. The CJC attempted to mislead the committee, I believe, and used its considerable resources in this endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hoped that under a new chairman these matters will be addressed. It is further hoped that he will personally examine submissions now made public from this inquiry. Likewise it is necessary for the media to be vigilant of such abuses. In this regard Channel 7 must be commended for its program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Report</EMPHASIS>, which strongly impacted on the establishment of this inquiry and which examined the Reynolds/Harris case. Ultimately, the government of the day is responsible for justice administration and its accountability will be judged in the ballot boxes. Perhaps the new Attorney-General, Mr Foley, will address these most serious matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to bring to your attention the case of Dr Michael Wynne. Dr Wynne, a Queensland surgeon, has been a whistleblower in regard to the conduct of National Medical Enterprises. His case illustrates the way in which the law can be misused to stop whistleblowers from speaking out and the fact that multinational companies can pursue whistleblowers from outside Australia. National Medical is one of the largest and wealthiest owners of hospitals in the United States of America. It purchased a controlling interest in the Western Australia company Markalinga in December 1991. Markalinga was renamed Australian Medical Enterprises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National Medical has recently paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to settle actions which include fraud, bribing doctors and even, extraordinarily, kidnapping patients. Over half of National Medical's US hospitals are now listed in a guilty plea to pay bounty for patient referrals. Australian Medical contracted to pay National Medical over $1 million a year for the services of a senior National Medical administrator and for access to National Medical's business expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wynne first became alerted to National Medical's practices in 1988 when he went to Singapore following the death of his son. This was long before they were exposed in the United States but his protestations then fell on deaf ears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 and 1993 Dr Wynne personally undertook an investigation of National Medical's practices, travelling to the USA at his own expense. The documents he brought back were a factor that caused the health department in New South Wales to advise against the granting of licences. The health department stressed the `lack of frankness' displayed by Australian Medical in its dealings with the department. National Medical claimed that the US directors of the Australian company knew nothing of the fraud. They claimed this occurred in a few hospitals only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health department was overruled by a judge delegate. Subsequent documents obtained by Dr Wynne from the USA included monthly reports to Australian Medical's US directors. These reported on the business practices in the hospitals where the fraud was perpetrated. The company's further expansion was restricted and they have now left Australia. This is in no small measure due to Dr Wynne's efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned previously, Dr Wynne's suspicions were aroused in 1988 and over the next few years he made his own confidential inquiries. He was concerned at the adverse consequences of National Medical's practices for patient care. He took action through the Singapore Medical Council and two doctors were suspended from practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1991, Dr Wynne wrote to the chairman of the Singapore Medical Council to advise him of his concerns about National Medical's business practices in Singapore. I quote from this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It (the information he obtained) suggested the exploitation of patients and the presence of unscrupulous and criminal activities in some portions of the medical services provided.</PARA>
<PARA>Those who ran the hospitals in Singapore subsequently became directors and administrators in Australian Medical. During 1993, Dr Wynne repeatedly raised his concerns with Australian Medical's Australian directors. Instead of addressing his concerns the company's lawyers threatened him with an action for defamation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1994, Dr Wynne obtained court documents from Singapore. In these a surgeon, Dr Alan Ng, alleged in evidence that hospital administrators, including those in Australia, had offered him financial rewards based on the number of patients he admitted to this hospital. The hospital's lawyer accepted that these negotiations had taken place but accused the doctor of proposing the unethical practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before that trial the hospital indicated that several of those present at the meetings with Dr Ng would give evidence. The hospital did not call any of its witnesses to challenge Dr Ng's evidence, nor did they produce any evidence to support the slur they cast on his integrity. Subsequent to this, National Medical has pleaded guilty to identical practices in the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wynne now felt an obligation to act. He was guided by the directive of the World Medical Association. This was formulated by the World Medical Assembly in October 1993. Both the Australian and the American medical associations are members of the World Medical Association. This directive states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should medical practitioners perceive circumstances which might adversely affect patient health, it is their duty to inform responsible authorities so that remedial action may be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should responsible authorities decline to take remedial action, reasons for the decision should be made known to the medical practitioners who reported the circumstances. Should such notification not be provided or should the rationale for the decision prove unconvincing, the medical practitioners concerned have a duty to take further actions.</PARA>
<PARA>Singapore authorities had not been receptive to Dr Wynne's concerns. Dr Wynne took steps to inform doctors in Australia and Singapore of National Medical's business strategies. He attempted to warn them of the pressures to which they might  be subjected and the inducements which they might be offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wynne also took these court documents to Mr Griffin, Australian Medical's Australian chairman. Dr Wynne asked Mr Griffin to stand these persons aside while the matter was investigated. Mr Griffin refused to do so. The persons concerned had all been promoted. Some held senior positions in National Medical's empire and in the Federation of American Health Systems. This federation is a powerful group representing corporate medicine in Washington. It is dominated by National Medical Enterprises and Colombia Healthcare. Dr Wynne sent the court documents to this federation. They have never been acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soon after this, Dr Wynne received threats of defamation actions from the Singapore hospital, from Australian Medical and from Denis Brown, the National Medical administrator appointed to run the hospitals in Australia. These threats demanded that Dr Wynne sign retractions and admit that the aspersions he had cast and the allegations he had made were totally without foundation. Dr Wynne refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Denis Brown commenced a defamation action in March 1995. Dr Wynne made three applications to the court for orders that Brown detail properly what his claim was. Seven months later when Brown withdrew his action he had still not properly formulated his claim. Company reports indicate that National Medical funded this action. Brown's expenses exceeded $63,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three days after Brown withdrew his action, Dr Wynne was served with a writ from the Singapore hospitals. Dr Wynne does not believe that he has overstepped the limits of legitimate comment but he is aware that the law in Singapore does not encourage whistleblowers. He intends to contest this action. Both of these actions relate to Dr Wynne's attempts to fulfil his obligations under the World Medical Association's directives and warn his medical colleagues of National Medical's unethical business practices. Dr Wynne has not been cowed by these actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the agreement which National Medical made with the US justice department when it pleaded guilty to criminal charges in June 1994, National Medical set up an ethics committee and a compliance program. To escape its past, National Medical has changed its name to Tenet Healthcare. It claims that this new name with its positive associative meaning reflects a new commitment to integrity. I quote from National Medical's company report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our compliance program is directed by a management level committee, chaired by Michael H. Focht Sr., president and chief operating officer, and supervised by the ethics and quality assurance committee of the board. We have made it very clear that NME will not tolerate ethical misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA>A curriculum vitae issued by National Medical in 1993 indicates that Focht was president of National Medical's international division at the time when Dr Ng alleged the company's vice-president and other staff were offering him unethical inducements. It also indicated that he was a director of the Federation of American Health Systems. He became a director of Australian Medical in 1993. He is therefore likely to have been involved in the decisions to refuse to investigate the Ng allegations and to prosecute Dr Wynne through the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wynne believes that Tenet cannot claim a new integrity and a willingness to address ethical issues when at the same time it refuses to explain why it failed to challenge allegations of unethical practices and then launched defamation actions against those who challenge their failure to do so. Dr Wynne is asking National Medical to honour its public commitment to integrity and its statement that it will not tolerate ethical misconduct. He has asked Tenet's ethics committee to investigate the conduct of National Medical's international division in Singapore, to investigate their refusal to explain why they did not properly contest the Ng allegations and to examine the ethical implications involved in taking defamation actions against him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is particularly concerned at the possible involvement of Focht in these activities because Focht is now in overall charge of Tenet's compliance program. The welfare of patients in Tenet's hospitals will depend on the integrity which Focht displays in fulfilling his obligations under the compliance program. Dr Wynne is asking his medical colleagues in the USA to support his complaint. He believes that strong pressure will be required to induce Tenet to confront the evidence he has supplied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak very briefly about the exposure draft of an animal welfare bill and then seek leave to table it. The bill is in response to a Senate select committee's inquiry into animal welfare in 1985. Some five years ago an initial draft was produced in response to that committee's findings. The Humane Society International redrafted it in early 1995 and asked the Greens (WA) to present it as an exposure draft for wide ranging comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to recognise the now widely accepted principle that animal welfare issues are a major community concern. The exposure draft seeks to place animal welfare issues on the national agenda, provide a positive Commonwealth approach to animal welfare and set standards for the behaviour of humans in their relationships with animals. Former federal environment minister Graham Richardson, if somewhat flippant, recognised that when he said that the 1990s is the age of animal welfare. He was talking about the control of kangaroos, but nevertheless I think there is a recognition that it is of increasing importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to provide the legal framework for an effective, efficient and responsible system for the management of animal welfare, balancing economic viability with the ethical care needed to ensure that the most humane methods of treatment are used. This bill is being tabled today in order to obtain community consultation. We welcome any comments on it from all stakeholders&mdash;industry groups and community groups. Aspects of the bill have been highlighted because they involve special questions that will be dealt with during the community consultation process. I seek leave to table the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 October (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 2622) Senator Margetts asked me the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> "Is it true that the political risk cover to be provided by EFIC for the Lihir goldmine, which I understand does not have any reinsurance backing, was agreed to despite the fact that OPIC, the United States loan guarantee agency, has declined to provide similar cover on environmental grounds?"</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that support from the United States investment guarantee agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) for the potential supply of US equipment to the Lihir mining venture in Papua New Guinea was contemplated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I can say that in conjunction with the bank finance for the Lihir project, support is being provided by the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), EFIC's Canadian counterpart, the Export Development Corporation and EFIC.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the honourable senator that Senator Faulkner and I made a joint statement announcing EFIC's support for Australian exports to the project making it clear that the Government gave very careful consideration to all the relevant factors, including environmental issues. The extent of that process was outlined in the statement and included assessment by the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. The Government's assessment of the Lihir gold project was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
