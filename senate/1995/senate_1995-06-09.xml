<PARA>I will just speak very briefly to that motion. I have not moved that government business order of the day No. 9, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, be listed to be considered at lunchtime because, as I understand it, there is a concern&mdash;at least from Senator Harradine&mdash;that has been communicated to the government in relation to the listing of that matter. I do not intend to delay the Senate. I have moved the motion in respect of three orders of the day. I will have discussions with interested senators about the human services and health bill. There may be a need for me to inform the Senate at a later stage in relation to that particular bill, but at this stage I am not proposing that it be debated at lunchtime. </PARA>

As I understand the arrangement, we will deal with the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the interstate road transport amendment bills. If there is enough time available we will then have some debate on the second reading of the appropriation bills. Whether we get to the appropriation bills before lunchtime is yet to be seen. If we do, we would continue debate on the bills during lunchtime. We would be interposing certain speakers who were available and were prepared to give their second reading speech at lunchtime. We would cooperate with that arrangement. All I am saying is that there will need to be a little bit of finesse in the handling of this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Lees adverted to that fact during the debate on the bill. I think it is very important for the Senate to not be faced with such a bill in the future. I am suggesting that we proceed to divide the bill so that the message gets to people that they should not attempt in future to place into an omnibus bill issues that are totally unrelated to each other. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Before proceeding, Mr Acting Deputy President, I wish to raise another issue with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) and you. Our staff have had considerable difficulty this week properly accessing computer facilities in Parliament House and we have also had difficulty with the availability of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> arising from estimates and committee hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the computer facilities have failed on a number of occasions. This is causing problems in a range of areas.

I appreciate the problems that the Hansard staff are facing. Most of the problem in the Hansard area has been caused by the programming of the various committees and the demands of House of Representatives committees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) welcome the government's moves to protect the enforcement of human rights in response to the decision of the High Court in Brandy v the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others. We support it and are gratified that the High Court handed down such a decision, which reinforces one of the few constitutional protections of human rights in Australia&mdash;the separation of powers. The separation of powers embodied in the constitution ensures that non-judicial persons cannot exercise judicial power. As a result of the Brandy case, the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act that were passed in 1992 have been found to have never been valid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased that, in response to this, the government set up what has come to be known as the Basten committee to look at restoring both the protection of human rights and the constitutionality of those provisions. We are less happy with the government's amendments under consideration here today, which revert to the pre-November 1992 arrangements. I will detail some of the concerns a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the decision in the Brandy case did throw into disarray somewhat the determinations that had already been made since the amendments that were moved in this chamber were found to have not been valid. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has stated that 37 determinations were made between the passage of the amendments and the handing down of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case. It is fortunate that the validity of those amendments was tested at such an early stage before the rights of more people were adversely affected through the passage of the invalid legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be easy to attack the government and its legal advisers for introducing amendments to these acts that were so clearly unconstitutional. However, that is not the point. It is important that it is now the responsibility of the government to establish an effective and constitutionally valid mechanism for the protection of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short term, the government is simply amending the legislation to return to the situation before the 1992 amendments. While there is obviously a need to act rapidly, it is important that this be only a temporary measure. People may rightly say that we have not acted totally rapidly in this situation. Some measure of time has elapsed. My understanding is that the Basten committee has travelled quite a way down the path of providing some very good solutions to these problems. I certainly hope that that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the measures that are being introduced here as temporary measures cause some problems, because we are putting in place what was felt by everybody pre-November 1992 to be an utterly unsatisfactory and undesirable arrangement. To that end, one of the Greens' amendments relates to a sunset clause. I thank Senator Spindler for his comments on it and the indication from the Democrats that they felt we were a bit unrealistic in the date we had set. We could have thrown things into a bit of turmoil if our sunset clause had come up at the time when there could have been elections in the offing or when, in some such way, the results of the Basten committee could not have been brought to this place for proper consideration and discussion and be put into operation. So we have delayed that sunset clause stage until 1 September 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our reason for doing that was basically that there is a danger that, if we revert to the November 1992 position here, then it will stay like that for a long time. If there is an election and if there is a change of government or if there is the same government, there may be nothing that is a real incentive to look at the arrangements that were found to be so unsatisfactory then. That would be highly undesirable. The sunset clause stands in the place of an incentive to whomever is in government to redress what we believe to be a highly unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we believe it was never satisfactory is that the pre-November 1992 situation involved a double hearing which was adverse to the interests of the complainants. It also put them in difficulties with legal costs. It allowed their case to be available for scrutiny and we believe that is the reason why&mdash;and I know this will not be new to my colleagues in the chamber&mdash;the unsatisfactory and invalid amendments were put in place. It was to remedy what was found to be a very negative situation for complainants because of the lack of enforceability of determinations in the pre-1992 acts. It was that lack of enforceability which led the government to attempt to create an alternative process, which has subsequently been found to be unconstitutional by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason why there are some other amendments which we believe are far more satisfactory as interim arrangements than the ones that are proposed in this bill. I regret to say that, apart from some measure of support from the Democrats, we have not gained support for this. So it may well largely be a flagging of what we believe is a far better option than the one proposed by the amendments. Even at this late stage, I would urge my colleagues to reconsider their capacity to support the amendments that the Greens are putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, since the previous amendments and alternative process were found to be unconstitutional, we believe it is clear that determinations by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission cannot be used as an enforcement mechanism. A court mechanism must now be established. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre in Sydney has advocated the establishment of a `Human Rights Court'. Without wishing to pre-empt the recommendations of the Basten committee, the Greens (WA) would support the establishment of such a court. We made this statement in March this year, and we make it again now: this would give human rights and their protection the status that they require and which have been lacking to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under both the pre- and post-1992 schemes, persons whose human rights had been infringed could not go directly to the Federal Court for enforcement. They had to go through the conciliation and determination process conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. For many people, this would be seen as further barriers to the enforcement of their human rights. While HREOC has an admirable record in conciliating disputes, it is essential that any future regime allows people direct access to a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand the difficulties faced by persons seeking to enforce their human rights and the differentials in power and resources between the victims and the perpetrators of human rights abuses. As a consequence, the government must ensure that the mechanisms in such a court are free from undue formality and legalism. It must also ensure that there is adequate legal aid and other support for people seeking to protect their human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation which this parliament has enacted to protect human rights is a good first step; however, there has never been in place the necessary enforcement mechanisms that we believe are required. This interim situation, the one which I believe is being supported here today, is highly unsatisfactory. I urge my colleagues to consider the value of the Greens' amendments in which we suggest that an option be available to a complainant either to stay within the conciliation and determination provisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, in full knowledge that there is not an enforcement capacity, or to choose to go direct to the Federal Court after the completion of the conciliation part of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, that option actually removes the criticism that was involved in the double hearing, and we believe that that would have been a far better interim arrangement to be putting in place at this point in time&mdash;especially if there is as much reluctance about supporting the sunset clause as there is about supporting our mechanisms for the interim arrangement. There is no incentive on any government to redress this highly undesirable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe the government should not miss this opportunity to provide an effective and powerful mechanism for the protection of human rights. That is even more significantly important today&mdash;the day we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act and the significant step forward it represents in the protection of human rights for the people of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been implied, and perhaps explicit, criticism of the Attorney-General's Department in the course of this debate. Senator Chamarette has taken the government to task for not developing a regime that is fair and expeditious, which can be used at reasonable cost, in which there is not undue formality and which protects human rights. She is right to want those sorts of things. They are put again and again to the Attorney-General. People want a particular regime; they want to achieve things that are good to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General and the people who work in the department who have given outstanding advice, not only to the government but generally over the years, have been asked to try to accommodate that. If the Attorney-General's Department never worked out a scheme which would accommodate the sorts of things that Senator Chamarette requires, then it would never make a mistake. If we want to see what the limit of constitutional power is for the Commonwealth&mdash;so as to accommodate good legislation; so as to make Australia a fairer place; so as to bring human rights within the ken of people who live in this country&mdash;we have got to test what it is that is constitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody knows what is constitutional until a matter comes before the court. Even the High Court does not know what is constitutional until a matter is put before it. I suggest that people look at the judgment of Justice Brennan, as he then was&mdash;Chief Justice Brennan, as he now is&mdash;in the case of Theophanous and the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd when he goes into this very point of how the law develops. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Common law is amenable to development by judicial decision, subject to the Constitution and to statute. What is permissible development of the common law by the courts and what amounts to impermissible change is an issue on which minds differ most sharply.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the common law. Then Chief Justice Brennan talks about the constitution. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the Court cannot change the Constitution, nor can it convert constitutional silence into a legal rule with constitutional force. I do not mean that, in changing conditions, the Constitution does not have a changing effect . . . that the denotation of its terms does not change . . . that the course of judicial interpretation does not reveal that a past constitutional doctrine is untenable . . . or that new situations do not reveal new doctrines inherent in the constitutional text. The Constitution speaks continually to the present and it operates in and upon contemporary conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>I see some representatives of the Attorney-General's Department are here today. I know that they are people of outstanding legal ability, of great integrity and of great patience, particularly when they come before Senate committees. Those people are testing again and again, on the request of government, how far we can go to make Australia a better society, a fairer society and a more just society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, given the sorts of things that Justice Brennan, as he then was&mdash;he is now Chief Justice&mdash;said and given the sorts of things that Senator Chamarette and others have said before about the need for a new regime, people have to go out and give things a go. If they do that, they might make a mistake. Given all that, the Attorney-General's Department should not be criticised for the result in Brandy's case. It is unfair to take it to task for doing what the government and what this parliament wants it to do. It was this parliament which passed the legislation that was held invalid in Brandy's case. What we should be doing instead is marking the debt we owe to the great advice we get from the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example of how much we owe the department is the Native Title Act, which was challenged in the High Court and which the High Court upheld. The High Court could have gone the other way on that but it upheld that act, which has advanced Australia's standing as a fair and just society in a very big way indeed. I conclude my remarks by saying it is good to see the Attorney-General's representatives here. They have done a great job and will continue to do so in years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond on behalf of the government to some of the issues raised in the debate. My colleague Senator Cooney has already made a response to some of the issues raised in the debate. I thank him for that contribution in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the suggestion from Senator Vanstone that the fate of the scheme invalidated the Brandy decision indicates that the government is receiving poor quality legal advice, I make the point that the area of judicial power in the constitution is a very complex one and the High Court has great difficulty in defining the concept. In enacting the former scheme, the government had legal advice from eminent lawyers such as the former chief general counsel in the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;a well recognised expert in constitutional law. The scheme was also supported by, for example, Sir Ronald Wilson, currently President of the HREOC and a former High Court judge. When one deals with complex novel areas of the law there will be a divergence in views, and the High Court is of course the final arbiter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion was also made during the debate that the legal advice provided to the government should be made available to the parliament. Legal advice is made available to the government of the day not the parliament, and it is for the government to make it available to the parliament if it is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also suggested by Senator Abetz that the government should have permanently resolved this issue by now. I would point out to the Senate that on 27 February 1995, only four days after the High Court handed down its decision, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) announced the government's two-stage response to the decision. Firstly, as an urgent interim measure, it was decided to reinstate the pre-1993 scheme so that the determinations of the HREOC could be enforced. The government has been endeavouring to introduce these amendments since March. Secondly, the review committee which had been examining the role and structure of the HREOC was expanded and given the task of considering the options for a new permanent scheme and reporting to the government by June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee chaired by Colin Neave in the Attorney-General's Department was expanded to include John Basten QC, Dr Sue Kenny and the Law Reform Commissioner Chris Sidoti. The Attorney-General also announced on 22 February 1995 that there would be consultation of any proposal before it went to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has considered several options. A draft proposal has been developed and consultations have been held with a wide variety of interest groups. These consultations have included: on 9 May, government departments and agencies; on 12 May, relevant agencies of state and territory governments; also on 12 May, a wide variety of non-government organisations; on 19 May, the ACTU and business and industry groups; and, on 23 May, the Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal has also been the subject of consultations with the coalition, the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine. The committee has also received a wide range of written submissions and will shortly finalise the proposal. A report will be provided to the government by July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz has also raised a question as to whether, under proposed section 105B of the government amendments,  respondents would be able to receive legal or financial assistance to defend themselves against a frivolous or vexatious claim. As is provided for under proposed subsection 105B(1) paragraph B, a respondent would be able to apply for such assistance. If he or she were able to satisfy the Attorney-General that it would involve hardship to the person to refuse the application, and that it is reasonable in all the circumstances, assistance could be granted. A decision in these cases would be made on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government welcomes the debate. On behalf of the government, I wish to remind the Senate and the community of the purpose of this bill. This bill amends the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 and other human rights legislation to implement the recommendations of the initial report of the joint review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That report made recommendations relating to resource utilisation, corporate performance and the structure of the HREOC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendments to the HREOC Act is to provide that the responsibility for the management of the commission is vested in the commission as a body corporate with a chief executive office of powers to be delegated by it to an executive director appointed by the commissioner under the Public Service Act. This means that all powers of the secretary under the Public Service Act will be removed from the Human Rights Commissioner and settled upon the President and commissioners collectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also moved amendments which respond to the consequences of the High Court's decision in Brandy versus Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Others on 23 February, which held that the mechanisms for the enforcement of determinations for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, other than determinations made effecting respondents who are Commonwealth agencies, was constitutionally invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments amend the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and the Privacy Act 1988 to reinstate the procedure for the enforcement of the determinations made by the commission as it operated prior to 1992. This will operate as an interim measure pending the development of a new mechanism to enforce determinations of the commission to replace that which was held to be invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New amendments have also been moved by the Greens (WA) to allow direct access to the Federal Court and for a sunset clause. We do not believe it is appropriate that the Commonwealth legislation establishing enforcement procedures in Australian courts should be subject to any clause which automatically, by lapse of time, extinguishes individual rights to access the courts and human rights cases. It is always open to the parliament to revisit and amend the legislation at any time if the parliament so decides. For this reason the government will oppose those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second amendment proposed by the Greens (WA), we are also concerned that major expenditure would be required if the Federal Court Act were amended to confer jurisdiction on the court to hear these cases from the outset. Given the large number of cases that might be filed under such a procedure, the delays in recruitment of court staff and the court accommodation problems could be significant. The high cost of filing fees, the adversarial system and the lack of any special procedures to handle discrimination cases make this proposal quite inappropriate. The government notes the contribution of all honourable senators. I commend the bill to the Senate as a worthwhile step to improve the operation of HREOC and to provide an effective and necessary interim solution to the Brandy decision. </PARA>

<PARA>As I have indications that there is not sufficient support for these amendments in the chamber, I will not be calling a division as I do not wish to delay the time of the chamber. I sincerely regret that there is not sufficient support to make the arguments against the government's position stronger. I believe that the government has not adequately addressed an interim arrangement that meets the needs of the complainants who will be disadvantaged by a reversion back to the pre-November 1992 arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments deal with the option that I am presenting on behalf of the Greens (WA). Instead of reverting to the situation where a complainant to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission has an enforced double hearing which allows their arguments to be heard and which gives an undue advantage and a shift in the power balance to the person against whom they are making the complaint, our option is that at the end of the conciliation process the complainants are given a choice. They can say, `I want to proceed through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission process from conciliation to determination in full awareness that there isn't an enforceability capacity within the commission to do that.' I am not a lawyer&mdash;my legal colleagues may be more aware of this than I am&mdash;but my understanding is that, if people have proceeded through a conciliation process and they are coming to an almost mutually agreeable solution with the people whom they have the complaint against, they can suddenly decide that it is likely to be resolved without the need for enforcement. Therefore, there is no harm in proceeding at this level and taking that into consideration. It may also be that the penalty and the likelihood of the people whom they have the complaint against not agreeing with that response are so small that they would feel that it would be a waste of time and energy to go to the Federal Court. That option remains available to them. They can proceed to that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of one of the amendments is to give people the option of either proceeding through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission or, at the point that conciliation is completed, electing to go straight to the Federal Court for a proper consideration of their case for the first time. They can get a determination which will have the enforcement provisions of the judicial framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving the complainant that option, in my view, redresses the disadvantage that remains here, which is that double hearing option. They get a determination and then they go to the Federal Court where that can be challenged. I believe there is also a problem with the double provision of any legal aid support. There is another financial disadvantage in the position we are reinstating now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a third option, but I did not write it into the amendments. I will describe it at this point. In that first option where people elect to go straight through with the commission from the conciliation to the determination process, if a contract is made during that determination process between the two parties there might be some capacity to register that contract in the arbitration court without contravening the constitutionality question of the separation of powers being violated. That is a finer point. I am not going to expand on it because I understand I do not have the support of the opposition on these amendments. The government has already indicated its stance. I would seek a comment from the opposition to this&mdash;</PARA>

The finer point that could be made on a complainant remaining with the human rights commission, even in the absence of that enforceability, would be that they could make a mutual agreement to arbitrate and seal their agreement in the arbitration court. This would thereby move the enforcement capacity from the arbitration court to the contract or agreement that has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that I omitted to mention my response to Senator Spindler's suggestion that the Democrats would be willing to support our amendments if we had agreed with their further amendment. The problem I see with that is that the purpose of our amendments is to retain the support of the human rights commission with the complainant and not to have them disadvantaged by the double hearing. If the option we are providing can occur only with the support of the party that might be the problem that caused the person to choose to go to the Federal Court, it is self-defeating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to combat a power imbalance that the current situation allows and shift it back to being with the person who has the legitimate grievance that has been heard through the conciliation process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I pass on from that, I ask the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) for some statistics relating to how many people have been going through the court system. I did have those figures in my file. I do not have them with me, but my memory of them is that only a relativity small number have needed to go on to the determination stage each year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to challenge the minister's criticism of our amendments that the costs would be too high for two reasons. One reason is that I would like, as a way of guiding us, some evidence of those costs and what the expectations would be in relation to the previous figures of complaints that have gone either through the conciliation process or to the determination stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I make the point that, if we simply say the costs of the arrangement being suggested by the Greens are too high and we cannot afford to give legal aid or support to people to go through that means, we are admitting that the interim solution becomes the cheap option, and it is a cheap option where the complainant bears the cost. That is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to be looking at how well we can address the human rights concerns of the people who are making complaints to the commission; we should not be evaluating this in terms of the cheapness or the lack of costs of the mechanisms that might be provided. It is a double thing. I express concern that that is a main argument against our provision. I also want some evidence that that is the case and that it is substantially more expensive&mdash;not that I will necessarily agree with it even if it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the most persuasive argument against our amendments is the fact that it might pre-empt the Basten committee's responses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just make a few very brief comments. First of all, at first flush, the Green proposals do carry a degree of attraction to me. But we, on this side of the chamber, are of the view that we ought to await the outcome of the Basten committee to determine what our stance is in relation to those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I agree with Senator Chamarette's view in relation to not having to have a double hearing, she did make comments about power imbalances. That is a two-edged sword. Having been involved in matters of this nature, I have observed where, say, at the conciliation process certain comments are made, allegations are traded and, at the end of the day, it looks as though the complainant might not necessarily have a strong case. But then, all of a sudden, you are delivered with a two-page letter with fresh allegations that have never been canvassed before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you can have a situation where the process does allow people to bolster their case or, indeed&mdash;as is the other side of the coin&mdash;for the respondent to try to come up with arguments or scenarios as to why the complainant should not be believed. So, whilst I accept as Senator Chamarette's view that there can be a power imbalance against the complainant, it can also work to the disadvantage of the respondent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other brief comment I would make is that I note, with interest, in proposed section 76A(1) and (2)&mdash;and I am not sure if it is anywhere else&mdash;mention is made of the trade union acting on somebody's behalf. That suggests this is, if you like, a quasi industrial matter. Yet I would like to think it adds some strength to the comments I was making yesterday; that is, that there ought be some requirement on a complainant who seeks to make a complaint against an employer under the vicarious liability sections to register a complaint with an employer in some formal sense and in some detail, so that six months down the track the employer is not told about certain things that occurred in the workplace of which the employer genuinely can say, `I'm sorry, I didn't even know it was going on.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, under the workers compensation guidelines&mdash;in my state at least&mdash;an employee has to put in a formal claim and advise the employer of it, and the process runs from there. I think it would add strength and merit to the system and provide some protection to employers under the vicarious liability sections of the various aspects of the legislation&mdash;that is, the sex discrimination, racial discrimination and disability discrimination legislation&mdash;so that there is some forewarning to the employers.

I admit that the committee was, in the ultimate, unable to effectively give justice to complainants because it lacked teeth.

The weight of that collective opinion was sufficient in most cases to settle the matter.

<PARA>I will address the amendment because Senator Harradine has asked me a question about its wording. I am not sure whether the amendment has made the intention of the Greens clear. In my view it has, but that may not be the case for others. As I have already pointed out, we believe that, because the current situation which the chamber has supported is unsatisfactory and reverts back to the previously unsatisfactory provision that existed prior to November 1992, there should be an incentive for the government to implement the provisions that the Basten committee may consider which will address the issue far more satisfactorily for the complainants. I acknowledge that it should be fair and just for all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three parts to the sunset clause. They basically state that the amendments that we have just made to the schedule will cease to have effect at the commencement of an enactment implementing the recommendations of the Basten committee or on the commencement of an enactment creating a division of the Federal Court known as the Human Rights Division or on 1 September 1996, whichever is the soonest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to clarify the intent of the Greens' amendment. It is not trying to tie this parliament down to any enactment of the provisions or recommendations sought to be implemented by the Basten committee. It simply says that, if through parliamentary consideration those new provisions are coming to the stage of enactment, then these amendments will lapse. That is fairly self-explanatory. We do not intend to tie the parliament into anything unknown ahead of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments just made will lapse with a satisfactory enactment implementing the recommendations of the Basten committee or with a solution which the Greens feel&mdash;and I am sure many others feel&mdash;would be highly desirable and that is that the Human Rights Court be set up or with the lapse of time. The minister has said that the government is concerned about the lapse of time provision. The minister said that we should not implement provisions that lapse simply with the passage of time. I concede that that has some weight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that it was not desirable to put the amendments, which were found to be unconstitutional, into place as a solution to the problems when some people knew that they were unconstitutional.

That is the reason we presented as an interim arrangement what we felt was a better position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I believe that an equally undesirable situation will result if we do not have a sunset clause or some kind of break in this process. As we revert back to the pre-November 1992 double hearing situation and its associated problems, there will be no in-built incentive to change the position. If the Basten committee reports in 1995 there is not a big problem having a lapse at 1 September 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the problem? The problem is that the government knows&mdash;and indeed everybody in this chamber knows&mdash;that, due to the electoral contingencies that may arise after July 1995 and before September 1996, the solutions put forward by the Basten committee may not actually come to this place for consideration. That is why it is quite important to have a sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing now&mdash;let us not forget it&mdash;is something we rejected previously. We rejected it as inappropriate and disadvantageous to the complainant. We are now re-asserting it. We need a sunset clause to say that this is not an adequate state of affairs. We should not be passing something that we believe is inadequate anyway. Therefore, if we are saying that we should not have a sunset clause because it implies we are passing something that is inadequate, let us not forget that that is what we are doing. The incentive will then be on any government by September 1996 to implement a solution that is far more desirable than the one that will be passed in this chamber today. </PARA>

When the coalition wins government, it will need some time to adjust to things in the first month and get its legislative program in order. Whilst September next year is 14 months away, allowing for a federal election in the meantime, even in the remote chance that the government is returned, we would need to take five months out of that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995 and related bills aim to set up a new dairy market support arrangement in Australia. Essentially, this legislation replaces the old dairy legislation which was found to be illegal under GATT. Importantly, it will continue the phase-out of assistance to the dairy industry. I am pleased, therefore, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, has come on duty to take important note of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old legislation aimed to phase down assistance to the equivalent of a five per cent tariff by the year 2000. Based on a levy paid by dairy farmers on all milk, this money was pooled and used to assist export returns. The objective was to encourage companies to export rather than dump their product on the domestic market and risk forcing down prices. Under GATT, this assistance was seen as an export subsidy and therefore illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry, government and the coalition agreed that new legislation was needed&mdash;legislation that not only continued the phase-out of assistance but met Australia's obligations under GATT. Priorities for the federal coalition were the continuation of benefits to the dairy industry and a minimum of disruption to consumers and manufacturers. This package meets our criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It sets out a new levy on market milk, as opposed to all milk, and should amount to no more than the current levy. It will be based on protein and fat content rather than just fat content. The new levy will be paid by farmers supplying market milk. It is GATT legal because market milk is not generally regarded as an export oriented product. Under the new arrangement, manufacturers will pay a levy on domestic manufactured products instead of farmers paying a levy on the milk used in manufacture. These funds will be redistributed to farmers based on the amount of manufactured milk, as opposed to market milk, supplied. It means that assistance will now be identifiable as a domestic market support scheme rather than an export subsidy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the effective phase down will continue at the same rate as the old legislation. The new scheme will terminate on 30 June in the year 2000 and any surplus funds will go to the Australian Dairy Corporation. The federal coalition sees no reason for the price of domestic dairy products to rise. The new arrangements simply transfer the levy paid on all milk to market milk and product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, because the levy will be based on protein and fat content, there may be minor adjustments in the level of payments to individual farmers. ABARE, along with the Australian Dairy Corporation, will estimate the annual level of support under the 1992 plan, to enable the government to set an appropriate rate for the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The import offset provisions in this legislation will protect the amount of dairy market support flowing to milk producers in manufacturing. Without these, the system could be manipulated to gain unfair financial advantage. In other words, someone could export dairy produce that has already been imported or displaced from the domestic market and then claim an export rebate without paying the manufacturing levy. Therefore, an import-offset levy payable by direct importers, and an acquisition-offset levy payable by manufacturers acquiring product from importers who have not paid the import offset levy, will be imposed on an annual assessment basis. These levies do not represent a surrogate import levy; they are applied only against the export rebate. This conforms with the GATT-legal principle that indirect taxation costs on production can be legally rebated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry is unquestionably one of Australia's great success stories. Just 10 years ago, the government was worried that, if the industry produced more than six billion litres of milk a year, we would have a glut and prices would fall. But thanks to the outward-looking nature of this industry, we are about to produce and sell more than eight billion litres of milk this year. Export income alone is expected to top $1.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has gone from a country giving daily milk deliveries to a country where dairy products have use-by dates that are the envy of the world. The industry has achieved this through hard work and a commitment to quality assurance. It controls the quality of the product from the cow in the paddock to the plate in the house, thereby ensuring Australia's world reputation for high quality dairy products. Dairying is an industry in which growers can value add and look after their interests past the farm gate. Around 70 per cent of all milk produced in this country is handled by dairy farmer cooperatives. Despite some early problems with undercapitalisation, the industry has aggressively developed branded products, particularly specialised products for niche markets, and profitability has improved. This in turn has attracted investment, and investment has grown. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it very clear that some of us wonder why we bother when some of our friends are not abiding by the rules. It is a matter of great concern amongst the dairy industry in Queensland and elsewhere around Australia that some of our very close friends, most notably the United States, are busy dumping milk powder products into the Philippines market. This is a market which we have supplied for a long period, a market in which we have a very firm hold, a market where there was no subsidy from the Europeans and a market into which, as a result of dairy subsidies in the US, milk powder product is being dumped. The Americans cannot say they are doing this to counter the threat of European subsidies. If they are honest, they must admit that this will lead to only a further breakdown in the objective of unsubsidised free trade throughout this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Tambling said so eloquently here today, the dairy industry is worth $1.4 billion to this country. It is very important that our producers get a fair return on their exports. It is absolutely critical. It is critical to the stability of the price of the domestic market. We are a very efficient producer of dairy products. We have to export those products in order to ensure that we get a decent price in Australia&mdash;that is what all the arrangements have been about&mdash;and, even when we do so, we can get them into markets cheaper than local producers overseas. I have seen that in supermarkets overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It riles me and the industry immensely when this sort of thing happens because all it does is reduce our return and reduce the value of the dairy industry around the world. That is the consequence of the American arrangements. As I said to the dairy industry in North Queensland last month when I opened its conference, it is important that we ensure, through whatever means possible, the message is taken to the Americans that their actions are unsatisfactory. I hope Senator Collins has done that this week. I hope to have an opportunity to do so myself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that in the long run we develop a market overseas for fresh milk and fresh dairy products, which we can supply at an advantage compared with the rest of the world. Our proximity and the good air communications between Australia and many other countries mean that we can get fresh product into the market cheaper, more efficiently and more quickly than any of our competitors. That ultimately is the long-term future for the Australian industry. It is tied to growing living standards overseas so that people can afford fresh product instead of a powdered product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why we are so susceptible in the Philippines market is that on the whole people do not yet have the capacity to buy fresh milk that has been brought in from overseas. They cannot afford it. That is why the powdered product comes in. The reason why the Americans subsidise the powdered</PARA>
<PARA>product is that their greater distance from the market does not leave them at a disadvantage when product has been processed and powdered because it keeps longer. Obviously, with a fresh product we can effectively, as our citrus producers have found, lock out people who are a long way away. A fresh product is after all a higher quality product because people are getting a product which is purer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying the Americans have to recognise that their friends are being hurt by their actions. Their friends have a limited tolerance for this sort of activity. I thought it was very peculiar that the Americans were suggesting that defence arrangements be one of the negotiating chips in their trade dispute with Japan. If we took that attitude in this country, I am sure that our American friends would be hopping up and down at the suggestion that we were going to blackmail them. I do not think our friendship should be taken for granted. I do not believe the Australian dairy industry should be taken for granted either. </PARA>

Its leader, who is a very successful industry leader, Mr Pat Rowley, negotiated successfully with the government to get another scheme in which would replace the scheme the dairy industry had, and this is covered by the subsequent legislation. That is the background of why we are bringing this legislation forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I too would like to add my concerns to those of my colleague Senator O'Chee, who has said there is concern in primary industry. There is concern all over Australia that the GATT round, and the next step to that is the World Trade Organisation, is starting to go a bit wobbly in the knees. We expected great things from the World Trade Organisation, and Australian primary industry made tremendous sacrifices in the interests of getting the GATT round and the next step, the World Trade Organisation, clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sacrifices caused severe pain out in the farmlands where tariffs were cut to the bone and where different schemes were amended because they were not GATT legal. We saw the citrus industry take a huge belt. The tobacco industry had its subsidies and levies cut. We deregulated the wool industry by taking the floor price out. We deregulated the wheat industry by deregulating the domestic price, which lowered the price of wheat in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised some fears. When we accepted the World Trade Organisation, Australia made tremendous sacrifices in its loss of some of its sovereignty in some of the things we had to accept. For instance, our anti-dumping laws had to be watered down to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organisation. I made that very point at the Senate inquiry where we investigated this. But I was told by the government that that was not so. I was told that I was being an alarmist, a populist and trying to raise the alarm. I see now that Senator Collins and the government agrees with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our anti-dumping policy, which I did not think was all that flash, has been watered down. It is now agreed that it was completely inadequate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only briefly in response. Firstly, I would like to thank the coalition for supporting this legislation. I share the concerns, particularly some of the broader trade concerns and the detailed concern about the EEP subsidies for dried milk powder into the Philippines, that have been echoed by Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee. I know my minister, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), who is in the US at the moment specifically in relation to the issue of subsidies of US agricultural commodities, their effect on US exports and in turn their detrimental effect on our exports, is vigorously taking up these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the good aspects of the World Trade Organisation is that it gives us a framework of agreement in which to tackle some of those subsidies and see them reduced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements that we are considering today are important to the dairy industry. Again, I would agree with the opposition: Pat Rowley is a very effective advocate for the dairy industry. I have met him on a number of occasions. </PARA>

He is quite right in saying that it provides over $1 billion in exports a year. It is a phenomenal change in just a decade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 15th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super guarantee: its track record</EMPHASIS>, the committee addressed certain aspects of the small amounts problems and put forward a number of recommendations. Since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, the overwhelming concern of people contributing small amounts was the problem of the erosion of the capital contribution of the employer by fees and charges, especially for those people who changed jobs frequently or who were on low incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 and cognate bills, which are currently before the Senate, specifically address the small amounts problem. However, I believe it would also be useful to include in this debate the related further issue of the superannuation transfer protocol, which will be introduced not through legislation but through regulation. Therefore, to fully appreciate the total picture of the small accounts issue, I think we have to refer during this debate to both this legislation and the transfer protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, perhaps the greatest criticism of the superannuation guarantee charge surrounds the reduction of small balances by fees and charges. As evidence of the maturity of the industry, it is pleasing to report that the industry has been working with the government to devise further ways of achieving better outcomes for members with small account balances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past members have been faced with difficult administrative procedures in transferring their superannuation benefits, particularly when they change employment. The focus of the interaction with the industry and government has been to find ways to streamline and transfer processes as members change jobs&mdash;and I welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation sees the lodgment of small amounts with the Taxation Office as an interim or short-term measure&mdash;and just how interim is a matter of some question. But the Liberal and National parties perhaps take a harder line, and I am foreshadowing a committee stage amendment of a sunset clause in terms of the role for superannuation of the Taxation Office in handling small amounts. But once the concept of the ATO was introduced in terms of handling small amounts, the industry responded very quickly, and it was perhaps the industry superannuation funds that took the lead in accepting small amounts without reduction of the capital contribution by way of fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process essentially has meant some degree of cross-subsidisation, which is not always welcome but under the circumstances was deemed necessary and desirable. Naturally, other funds have followed some of the leading industry funds in adopting similar processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most important bill in this package of bills with which the Senate is dealing is the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill 1995. This establishes a reserve, known as the superannuation holdings account reserve, to facilitate the collection of small amounts by the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the establishment of such a reserve will be in the order of $5.6 million, while the annual cost of administration will be between $7 million and $7 1/2 million. Those running costs of between $7 million and $7 1/2 million will be offset by the earnings of the moneys in this reserve fund. But I must point out that there will be no erosion of the capital contributions made to Taxation Office holding accounts where an employer cannot find a fund that will accept small contributions. I must say that it would be fairly difficult for an employer not to find a fund nowadays, but this facility is there that will accept such moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Member protection rules will protect amounts under $1,000, and measures will be in place by 1 July 1995, hence the importance of getting this legislation through before the Senate rises. In fact, funds that decide not to operate under the new rules will not be able to accept small superannuation amounts from new members and, therefore, will be required to transfer existing balances below $1,000 to a fund which will protect employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has provided a list of those who provide member protection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, employees will not have direct access to their account balances.

On the other hand, amounts in excess of $1,200 can still be contributed but without the benefit of an allowable deduction to the employer.

On the other hand, when an individual attains the age of 65, he may request that the commissioner pay the balance of his account, with a reserve to him. There is no dollar limit on the account balance when the individual has attained the age of 65. Also, when an individual satisfies the commissioner that he or she is no longer resident in Australia, the amount can be transferred out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps this is an opportune time to raise an issue that was also raised in the committee's 15th report, which looked into the superannuation guarantee. Firstly, the committee recommended that the tax office's scheme should be limited to those employers unable to find appropriate funds offering member protection or unable to utilise existing employee accounts. Further, we recommended that PAYE forms should be utilised to simplify employers administration of their superannuation guarantee obligations. I trust that the government will pick up this recommendation, although it is not in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also pleasing that the government has accepted the recommendation of appropriate transfer protocols, which will also be in place by 1 July. However, one committee recommendation still has not been addressed; that is, that the government should look at the removal of the contributions tax, particularly from the early contributions. I believe that would also alleviate the small amounts problem. In other words, the government has asked industry to bear a cost, and we think the government should bear a cost in taking away some of the tax, particularly from the initial contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we must acknowledge that Australia now has a superannuation system similar to those in other developed countries, but it is unique in a number of ways, given that the payment of the compulsory superannuation is operated through private sector organisations rather than through a central fund of pay as you go basis. There is, therefore, an element of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Select Committee on Superannuation that I chair undoubtedly received conflicting evidence about the acceptance of the superannuation guarantee system. However, I must say now that the emerging and perhaps dominant view is that the progressiveness of the superannuation guarantee system has been widely accepted. That acceptance is firming over time. The issue now is really to finetune the arrangement. That is important because we have to protect those funds. They are now worth approximately $200 billion and could increase tenfold into the first part of the next century. From a prudential aspect, the biggest challenge at the moment is therefore handling what I believe is the potentially explosive issue of derivatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a cognate debate encompassing changes to a number of bills. Given the limited time available, it is absolutely impossible to address all the issues. I will look at the more fundamental ones, and I may seek the opportunity to extend the length of my contribution. I have looked at these bills cognately rather than taking 20 minutes on each bill, so I believe that, under the circumstances, that may not be an unreasonable request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill currently before the Senate, it is also necessary to amend a number of other pieces of legislation. These include the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act, the Taxation Administration Act and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Firstly, it was necessary to repeal the Superannuation (Rolled-over Benefits) Levy Act 1993, which permitted prescription of the levy of recouping of costs associated with a register of lost members from eligible rollover funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gives you some idea of the complexity of superannuation legislation. This change will bring about so many consequential changes to so many other acts. It is not surprising that we continually hear the story, `There are too many changes to superannuation. We can't understand it; it is just too complicated.' We also hear people say, `The funds aren't performing well enough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at another bill in question, which is the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, we see that the purpose of that bill is to amend four acts dealing with superannuation for Commonwealth civilian sector employees; namely, the Superannuation Act 1992, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act. It also includes some formal amendments to the Parliamentary Contributions Superannuation Act. That means further change and further complication, but it is all in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are important because they will continue to ensure that the process of Commonwealth superannuation arrangements complies with the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act. What we are trying to do is bring all of these various acts and schemes associated with the Commonwealth into line with the basic requirements of what are known as the SIS rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this week the Australian Retirement Income Streams Association submitted to the committee that perhaps one of the most effective ways of overcoming the problem of small amounts is for employees to be given ownership of their superannuation arrangements through the operation of an account with their chosen public offer fund to which all employer contributions are placed. It also points out that the bias towards industry funds actually runs counter to other areas of government policy where the government has sought to deregulate industries and public utilities and to encourage greater competition, and this has certainly been in line with the Hilmer recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I introduce this point because I think this is one way of addressing the small account superannuation, but there are other ways of addressing it. One of the other ways of addressing it, as I have just mentioned, was put forward in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation by the well-informed Australian Retirement Income Streams Association. I acknowledge its pioneering work in terms of the particular products that it has developed for retirement incomes and, particularly, for what I call allocated pensions, which are a very valuable and useful product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple thrust of the submission form ARISA, the Australian Retirement Income Streams Association, was that the current system does not recognise the basic proposition that people should have control over arrangements which they themselves are funding, whether that funding is direct or indirect. So this sort of proposition is, of course, not far from the Liberal Party view, which is that there should be more competition in terms of giving people the same control over their superannuation fund and their right of choice. Certainly, the advance in electronic transmission of funds through the banking system or through Australia Post does provide a very low cost and efficient facility where funds can be dispatched almost instantaneously right across a number of funds from the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the coalition took a courageous stand when it decided that rather than making, for example, retirement savings accounts conditional on this legislation, it would leave it as an election issue. It is just so important to get the small amounts in place before 1 July that we really did not want to be seen to be hindering the timing of putting into place what I call the intermediate step of the arrangements of the holding accounts through the Australian Taxation Office system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party believes there is a role for retirement savings accounts. However, my personal belief is that they are better situated at the bottom end of the spectrum. Once the amount starts to grow, they should be subject to the same prudential guidelines and trustee control that most other superannuation funds are subject to. This is something that I think should be put to the electorate at the next election rather than holding up this important bill, and I commend Mr Connolly for acknowledging this. Mr Connolly is the coalition spokesman on superannuation and is doing a very good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We should also look at this question of choice, because choice is inevitably involved in this whole question of superannuation. I must point out to the Senate that there are actually two aspects of choice. Firstly, there is beneficiary or member investment choice, which is allowed under SIS but which must be not only within the investment strategy guidelines laid down by the SIS rules and regulations themselves but also under a strategy determined by the trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, and quite distinct from the first&mdash;people often confuse this point&mdash;there is a choice of fund. I issue a warning in relation to the issue of choice of fund. I do not want to see people locked into poorly performing superannuation funds day after day or year after year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept that the government introduced of providing temporary capital gains tax relief for those funds that rollover or merge with each other is indeed welcomed, but what the government must do is extend this exemption from capital gains tax where funds do decide to merge. Over time there will be poorly performing funds and, in some cases, there should be pressure to encourage them to merge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big problem is: when should trustees send the message out that there should be a merger. This is always somewhat difficult. Therefore, I think the concept of temporary capital gains tax relief should be extended to a permanent arrangement. I believe we should also extend the scope of the concept. For example, approved deposit funds get an exemption from capital gains tax if they merge into a superannuation fund, but not necessarily if they merge into another ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties at the moment with superannuation funds is the emphasis on what I call short termism which results in fund managers jostling for poll position in terms of quarterly returns. What we must do is develop a long-term reporting process. I would like to see something incorporated in the annual statements. Members really need to know how their funds are performing in the long run in relation to other funds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a suggestion that a long-term or five-year figure produced by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission or the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, which is an umbrella organisation which plays a valuable role in setting the direction for superannuation in this country, could be included in each fund's member reporting mechanism when they are looking at the particular year under review. Members could then see how well their fund is performing compared with the overall average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are arguments against this, but people need to look at this issue more realistically than on a short-term basis. People get worried about short-term results in the paper. There have to be mechanisms where members can transfer with minimum cost and inconvenience. There also have to be mechanisms for the transfer or merger of those funds which are, on a long-term basis, consistently under-performing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the prolific increase in do-it-yourself super, commonly known as DIY super, it is not surprising that professional fund managers are worried about the outflow of their retail funds to do-it-yourself super. People with some investment knowledge who have been sensible enough to access the necessary technical and outside skills and resources should be able to continue with do-it-yourself super. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that there are two reasons for this outflow of moneys from the retail sector of super into do-it-yourself super. The reasons are the poor investment returns and the concern of members about fees and charges. The investment manager should be, rather than curtailing the operations of do-it-yourself super, addressing the two issues that I have just spoken about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the leading superannuation funds are performing quite well. I wish to use the opportunity to acknowledge the role and performance of a number of industry funds that have certainly been quite remarkable in their attempt to both contain costs and maximise returns. This leads me to the whole question of competition. I believe that there are certainly economies of scale. If we tend to encourage too many of these smaller superannuation funds or encourage superannuation to go in particular directions, we may not necessarily be doing what is best in the long term. There are obviously warm fuzzy feelings about certain types of investments in the short term, but they may not necessarily be best in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this leads me to address the issue of derivatives. The injudicious use of derivatives has the potential to reduce sizeable superannuation investments into small amounts. The Senate committee is pressing the ISC for a quicker response to the establishment of standards to regulate the uncontrolled use of derivatives. I have yet to see evidence of self-regulatory or prudential supervision that gives me sufficient confidence that another Barings type fiasco is less likely to occur in the future than it has in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware that the rate of change in the investment industry has been absolutely enormous. It was only two months ago that assent was given to the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill, which facilitates the trade of share ratios on Australian securities and futures exchanges. Products that were unknown 10 years ago are now part of that vocabulary. The issue is how parliament can keep control of these fast-moving changes in the commercial community and the application of these new products to superannuation and the risks that they may involve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, partly in response to the rate and extent of change in this industry, it is clear that there is a degree of concern and conflicting sentiment as to the balance of utility and security that derivatives afford. It is amongst this debate that I wish to put a special case for superannuation. One of the better performing investment managers, Maple-Brown, does not use derivatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, my time has run out, so I must conclude now. While the gains that leverage can make for investments are enticing, their potential to lose similar amounts represents, I believe, an unacceptable risk to superannuation funds. Superannuation, arguably more than any other form of investment, is an investment that recipients cannot afford to lose. In this debate on the small accounts issue, I have addressed a wider number of issues. They are all related to the safeguarding and security of an investment that is put away and which is so necessary not only to provide a stable, secure retirement income flow but also to increase national saving. I commend the bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These superannuation bills implement the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in June 1994 to establish a means of treating small amounts. The government's performance in this area has been tardy. In 1992, the Democrats warned that this would be a problem. Indeed, the problem would have been worse had we not raised the payment threshold from $250 to $450. We still believe that the problem could best be fixed by setting up a national fund for casual and part-time employees. In a sense, the ATO collection mechanism parallels or reflects that preference of the Democrats, but it is a second-best option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised and rather disappointed that the ACTU, in representing low income workers, has settled for what we believe to be second best. It seems that, now there are dozens of ACTU bottoms on superannuation fund trustee seats, perhaps the ACTU is not as interested as it should be in the small and part-time worker. It seems that instead it speaks as one in a voice undistinguishable from superannuation funds themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a worrying trend, especially as we will soon be in this place debating whether to reduce the disposable income of low income earners in compulsory superannuation contributions. The bill sets up an Australian Taxation Office collection mechanism and a superannuation holding reserve system. The object of the reserve is to allow small amounts to accumulate to such a level&mdash;that is, $1,200&mdash;that there is a viable account. Then the amount will be moved into a superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation funds will no longer be able to accept small amounts unless they agree to member protect; that is, agree that their fees cannot exceed the earnings of the fund. This ensures that, after allowing for insurance premiums, individual accounts will not go backwards, but in many cases it means that they will not go forwards. It fails to address the key fundamental problem that superannuation funds are not providing, and probably never will provide, a fair deal for low income workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry assures us that most funds will agree to member protect and that, as the SGC increases, the need for the tax office system will reduce over time. It may be true that there will be fewer ATO accounts needed in five or 10 years time, but there will still be a significant number, especially if the government fails to get its account consolidation process in place.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your assurance, Senator Watson. I will listen to the government if it responds to that interjection by you. The government is encouraging funds to join a transfer protocol which will encourage low cost wholesale transfer of accounts between administrators. Membership of the protocol is not compulsory. Low cost transfer is not compulsory. Data matching is not compulsory. In a way, we are simply crossing our fingers and hoping that funds will willingly pay over small amounts because it is in the best interest of their members. I am a little cynical. I am sure you will forgive me for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had intended moving amendments to make these things compulsory. However, the government has assured me that it is prepared to revisit the issue if these things do not come to pass. I do hope that success of the transfer protocol arrangements are redebated in this place in 12 months time and, if moral suasion has failed, then the big stick will need to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second key failing of the proposed system is the exclusion of other financial institutions which are better suited to dealing with small amounts than the large super funds are. Credit unions, building societies&mdash;as I understand it&mdash;and even perhaps banks have, to varying degrees, signalled a willingness to set up savings accounts which would allow the funds to accumulate with zero or no fees and with small interest. This offer is superior to anything offered yet by a super fund. A payment of even five per cent interest with no fees is better than a guarantee of zero return offered by member protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not believe that it is appropriate in this debate to discuss whether banks or other institutions should generally have access to superannuation. We have not been persuaded that this is the issue of competitive neutrality that the banks claim it is. However, we have been persuaded, based on representations from the credit union sector, that the financial institutions can offer a useful product to help low income earners and can provide a fairer deal for low income earners than that provided by the super funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate select committee set a series of criteria for a product in super savings accounts which we believed would be useful. The criteria are: no fees; an interest rate broadly comparable with term deposits&mdash;currently about five per cent or six per cent; access to the super complaints tribunal for complaints; and that funds be transferred to an aggregated fund when the amount of $3,000 is reached. The credit union sector has welcomed these conditions. I will be tabling later in this session a private member's bill to propose such a product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I want to talk about is the ATO mechanism, as it is still failing to provide what we believe would be a fair deal for low income earners. First, the earnings will be restricted to government and other trust account investments. In the long-term, this will reduce earnings by about one to two per cent in real terms. Second, the full running costs of the reserve will be deducted from earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, this is unfair. Low income earners get little benefit from superannuation concessions. Of the $6 billion of super concessions, over a third flow to the six per cent of people earning $50,000 or more per year, while the 22 per cent earning $20,000 or less get just 3.3 per cent of that tax benefit. Surely the government could find $7 million in this massively regressive super system to help the lowest paid even up the score a little. Its failure to do so shows that it and the ACTU are just not interested in low income earners and the battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Third, the government intends taxing contributions and earnings at the full 15 per cent, yet private super funds, due to imputation credits, can get away with a tax rate of 10.5 per cent. So high income earners will be lower taxed on their higher super earnings than low income earners. The government has been very clever here. It ensures that it gets its running costs paid before tax, and then it taxes what is left. The ATO is guaranteed a good stream of money. The Democrats would prefer to see the tax rate set at the tax rate prevailing for private super funds, which is currently about 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, the government will not allow award super to be paid into the ATO. This means that it will still be possible for a worker who is under several awards or industrial agreements to hold several active accounts. The government assures us that the industry funds are the most advanced on the transfer protocol, but this only covers inactive accounts. It is totally silent on active accounts, which is the area that the ATO is supposed to fix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats had intended moving a large number of amendments to this bill. The early debate of this bill, and the refusal of the government and the opposition to join with us to make this system more effective, precludes us from doing so. With great reluctance, I will support this bill as it is better than nothing, but it is nowhere near the fair deal it could have been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) basically works on the adjustment of the Commonwealth super scheme for its own employees, the old Commonwealth superannuation scheme, and the newer public sector superannuation scheme. As far as I can make out, the changes are simply part of the ongoing adjustment of superannuation which is required under law for schemes to maintain their position under changing legal regimes. It also seeks to make the position of part-time workers more explicit, although it does so by regulation rather than through legislation. There are a number of other minor technical changes, including the elimination of sexist language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not see any problems with this bill, which is mainly technical change and correction at this time. We do, however, have problems in relation to the future of superannuation. The Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill is a further substantive change to the super scheme. It is designed to address the problems that have been created for part-time and casual workers by compulsory employer superannuation. The problem is that when these workers have small sums paid into numerous different funds the money simply disappears, eaten up by charges. Obviously, in such a circumstance these workers get nothing from such measures. It would be better for them to get wages which are traded off against punitive gains such as super contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) basically support the scheme. We do not believe anyone could fail to support the principle of a scheme that tries to ensure that there are at least no losses from superannuation payments, especially for the poorest workers. We do feel, however, there is still progress to be made on the issue, but this is a corrective step. Whether it is a step in the right direction raises the whole issue of the relative merits of national savings schemes, private superannuation or simply paying workers and letting them deal with their own situation. But within the superannuation environment this measure at least is progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of the scheme is that the employer super contribution will be made into an eligible fund nominated by the employer. If it is currently being funded into a fund which is not an eligible fund, the non-eligible fund must transfer the account to an eligible fund without charging exit fees. When casual workers have an amount of money under $1,000 in an eligible fund and are employed by a new employer, they must state there is money in their fund and have it transferred again without exit fees to the funds into which contributions are currently being paid. I am not sure what happens if a worker has more than one job and is getting money paid into two funds simultaneously. Perhaps the minister can expand on that. An alternative is that the employer can nominate to put funds into the Australian Taxation Office fund that will be set up. This will hold super contributions until they reach $1,200, at which time it is intended they may be transferred to an eligible fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do these funds do? They offer protection from having the contributions eaten away. Fifteen per cent of the contributions are taken in tax in any case. Funds and the tax office will pay interest if any money is left after fees are taken out. Both eligible funds and the tax office will not be able to charge fees in excess of the interest earned. The impact is likely to be that no benefit actually accrues, no money is made&mdash;the money just sits there. This is better than having it disappear but not a lot better. It is certainly not as good as having the money where it can be used or where it might generate enough interest to keep up with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have mentioned that the Australian tax office is more likely to generate some real return than superannuation funds. Whether or not that is true, one advantage of many private funds is that they offer life and disability insurance to their members. So there are some real advantages in being in some private super funds even where no interest is made on money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Greens (WA) have a few major points to make about the Australian tax office reserve scheme. The first is that while, initially, the scheme will invest money effectively in only government bonds there is the possibility that, through the financial management and accountability measures, investments may be made elsewhere with the potential that the money could be used more explicitly to pursue government programs, even though bonds are essentially used in this way. The measure then makes it possible to create a pool of funds for government purposes outside the normal budgetary process of appropriations. Perhaps the government would like to respond as to whether that is ever likely to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second aspect is that there is the possibility that this bill, in establishing mechanisms for the Australian Taxation Office to deal directly with superannuation funds, may be used to facilitate the budget superannuation scheme of employee and government contributions. We are assured that Treasury and the Australian tax office would prefer not to have to deal with superannuation. The government has rejected notional savings, or superannuation schemes, in favour of private sector superannuation in spite of the plethora of regulations that are required to protect people required by law to be involved in superannuation as a savings and investment vehicle. I am still concerned that while the opportunities are there they may be acted upon. I do not feel we have enough time to ensure that this is not an implication of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government may think that a small party such as ours has many teams and that we can operate on each bill for months at a time. That is not the case. An amendment was circulated by Senator Watson today and I asked if it was possible for us to have the time to deal with that amendment&mdash;for the chamber to go on to the next second reading debate in order for us to be able to deal with that amendment and to assess its implications. The government said, `No, it's been around for a long time.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though we have not seen the amendment before, there was an amendment in the lower house. We are not in the lower house, and we do not get presented with copies of lower house amendments. Therefore, I find it a bit rich for the government to say, `You should've known it was in the lower house. Therefore, you should know everything about each bill before it comes even if it is not circulated to the Senate.' In terms of process, I think the public would be very disappointed to know that this is what the government thinks is the proper way to deal with legislation which is going to affect their future. This is what the government thinks is a good and proper way to deal with legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the obvious benefits of the act for people in broken unemployment, or underemployment, there are attractions in the opposition's amendments. I will say, however, that they would have been much more attractive if the sunset clause had been only for the Australian tax office's involvement rather than for the entire bill. As it is, a sunset clause on the act would probably on balance do more damage than good. I will be happy to hear the arguments presented by Senator Watson when that time comes around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill is a substantial improvement, the concerns persist and it really does not solve a number of the problems that we see associated with superannuation. I would like some commitment from the government that there will be a democratic process and that this Senate will be part of the democratic process, and that when the government's budget superannuation comes into being it will be a matter whereby the concerns of the public will be debated fully and properly. There will need to be some legislative mechanism, and perhaps the government could tell us when that might be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak reasonably briefly on these superannuation bills before the Senate today. I particularly want to speak in relation to the bill which deals with the small amounts problem and the government's attempt to solve that problem. The superannuation committee, which I have been a member of almost since my time of coming into this Senate three years ago, has been made aware of the problem of small amounts for a very long time. It seems as though the government itself has taken a long time to address that problem, which we know has been around for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say also that the work of that committee under the chairmanship of Senator Watson, who has been on the committee since its inception&mdash;and I know that Senator Sherry was the initial chairman of that committee&mdash;has been recognised for a long time. There is a tremendous amount of goodwill on that committee in making sure that, when we report, the recommendations we put forward are in the best interests of all Australians, particularly in the area of superannuation. That area is an ongoing problem throughout the community, particularly in relation to the community's awareness, understanding and education. Certainly in that area there is a lot more work to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also come to the committee having spent seven years prior to my entry into this place working in the superannuation industry. Even before I came to this place I was made acutely aware, because I was dealing with some of the clients involved, of the problem that fees and charges were having on small amounts and the abundance of small amounts that each member had purely because of the direction of where their superannuation contributions had to go. Over a long period of time now we have had a vast array of submissions about the problems of small amounts. The government has been rather tardy in at least helping to solve those problems that exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for addressing the small amounts problem is exacerbated by the government's overall attitude and philosophy towards the universality of coverage for superannuation. I know that in the eyes of most of the population there is a need for a universality of coverage. But it is taking it too far when that goes down to a contribution being made on the first dollar earned, particularly when at the end of the day the people who are having these very small amounts contributed on their behalf will receive little or no benefit when it comes to their retirement and any income that they may receive in retirement. Throughout my period in the superannuation industry that was one of the areas of concern that was always raised by people who were compelled to pay small amounts into funds which, at that stage, were charging quite outrageous fees and charges. I am the first to admit that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue also brings us to the debate regarding the threshold, which is part of the problem with small amounts. We have had hundreds of submissions presenting various points of view to the committee. There has been a wide range of submissions from Eva Cox of the women's economic think-tank, who could hardly be called an economic rationalist, to other employers who have put the same point of view suggesting that the threshold should be raised so that people at the end of day are likely to be able to provide in some way towards their own retirement&mdash;although we know that many people will be on a public and part private stream for a long time in the future. We get a broad range of advice that we should be looking at increasing the threshold. That is one area the government has failed to address and should address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 15th report of the Senate select committee one of the first elements in the proposal to alleviate the small amounts problem is for consideration to be given to changing the SGC threshold from $450 a month to a quarterly amount. This would mean that people in seasonal work may be able to avoid the problems being caused by having very small amounts put into a vast array of accounts from a variety of employers. I am doubtful whether the legislation put forward today will overcome that in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major issue I want to address which would alleviate many of the problems associated with small accounts is the adoption of member choice. If we could have member choice of funds it would mean that those people who have several employers could be sure that all of the contributions for the work that they do could be directed towards the one fund. If that were the case, it would eliminate a number of the small accounts. In these days of modern technology, with computerisation, where we can do a range of other things by transferring money electronically into a variety of accounts, if our money can be put into our bank accounts at the end of the month electronically, I am sure there is a possibility the same thing can be done with superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we can introduce member choice of funds, which is another issue that this government has not addressed, it would eliminate the need for so many small accounts being placed in another facility&mdash;whether it be the tax office, small superannuation accounts, credit unions or any other organisations. We had submissions that Australia Post now has the facility to handle small amounts and superannuation accounts. It was very enlightening evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once member choice is introduced&mdash;as I have said, it can only get easier in the future with the use of technology&mdash;then the problems confronting those people who have a variety of casual jobs and a variety of employers who currently insist that the contributions go into a range of different funds, each with small amounts, could be overcome. Once again, a number of those employees who have small accounts would find that they have much larger accounts which would be manageable by some of the industry funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations believes that consumer choice should be at the heart of the government's superannuation policy. Allowing small amounts to be placed only with the tax office is hardly allowing consumer choice. A lack of choice is identified by the Federation of Consumer Organisations as the contributing factor to the small amounts problem. Being able to choose a fund that best suits an employee's needs and having the option of amalgamating multiple accounts would result in a single account that they could carry with them throughout their working career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite sure that, if we get to the stage where the government adopts as part of its policy the situation where members own their own account, can watch their own account and have only one fund to check at any one time, then this government would be getting to the stage where the small amounts problem and all of the associated worries would be alleviated far more than facilitating payments being made to the tax office. Quite frankly, a lot of people in the community do not agree that the tax office is the best place for their money to be put. People are somewhat suspicious of the tax office. I guess that is just a natural happening amongst members of our community. Given a choice between the tax office, a credit union or a small savings superannuation account, I am sure that many people would choose not to use the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is the way the government has chosen to go in this particular legislation. As an opposition, we agree that we will support that move purely because, if we do not address the problem of small amonts right now and we do not have a facility for the payment of money, the general public and those who are involved in superannuation at what I would call the fringe level&mdash;that is, those with very small amounts&mdash;are going to become more disenchanted with superannuation than they are at present. When we see what has happened with investments, with the performance and erosion of funds due to fees and charges, there certainly is in the community a lack of confidence as to whether superannuation is ever going to provide people with benefits in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing that we have to try to convince the community of is that we are talking about a retirement incomes policy; we are not talking about a superannuation policy. A retirement incomes policy is the only thing that we really ought to be concentrating on. As I said, we will be supporting the government's move to use the tax office, although somewhat reluctantly. I think there are other ways of addressing the problem. People should have a choice between using the tax office and using another vehicle. But the problem has to be addressed today or as soon as possible so that we can help put some confidence back into the superannuation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that in the near future we will see the government move in the other areas, particularly the area of member choice. Once we can introduce some member choice, I think a lot of the problems with small amounts that we have today will be alleviated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I thank the various speakers for their contributions in this debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill and the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill. Whilst I did not agree with all his points, Senator Watson, as always, made a very effective and comprehensive contribution. Senator Watson is the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. As has been mentioned in this debate, I preceded him in that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of measures before us today is a cohesive package to deal with what has been known for some time as the problem of small amounts. The measures before us do effectively deal with this problem. They include: member protection of smaller superannuation accounts; reducing the number of multiple accounts; the superannuation holding accounts reserve, which is established by two of the three bills we are considering today; and a range of other initiatives, including measures contained in the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Small Accounts and Other Measures) Bill. They form a cohesive whole and for reasons I will outline a little later, we cannot accept the amendment of the opposition that would remove one of those elements&mdash;the superannuation holding accounts reserve&mdash;by scrapping it at the end of two years with no effective ongoing process in train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on to that issue, I will deal with a couple of matters that Senator Woodley asked and some matters that Senator Chamarette raised. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Margetts, sorry. I will deal with Senator Woodley first. The government will not tax the amounts in the superannuation holding accounts reserve. When transferred to a super fund, it becomes a taxable contribution of that fund and is taxed at the fund's rate, normally 15 per cent, less the imputation credits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, like Senator Watson, do welcome the industry's initiatives in setting up the transfer protocol. The government agrees to report to the parliament on industry progress with the transfer protocol by the last day in September 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the sunset clause that Senator Watson raised, the government wants funds to do the right thing and to member protect. But we do need the superannuation holding accounts reserve to ensure a complete solution to the small amounts problem. For that albeit diminishing problem&mdash;we expect it will be less and less of a problem over time&mdash;we need the continuance of that holding accounts reserve beyond two years. To simply have a sunset clause to abolish the holding accounts reserve at the end of two years without knowing what would replace it, would remove one of the effective parts of the package we are presenting to the chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would become of moneys in those accounts? We do not know. What would happen to this holding accounts reserve? Would it be subcontracted to someone in the private sector? We do not believe an appropriate way to deal with the holding accounts reserve is to simply have it guillotined out of existence at the end of two years. That is not a responsible way to deal with moneys that are in that holding accounts reserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue raised is that of a person who has two jobs&mdash;part time, casual or full time&mdash;and is in two funds. If you hold two jobs, you will have moneys contributed to two funds, although there are some exceptions. For example, in the hospitality industry&mdash;and I was a trustee of the hospitality industry fund&mdash;you could work at a hotel and a restaurant in the same city, and so have two employers but, because the fund covers the hospitality industry, it is highly likely that you have moneys going from two employers into the one fund. You would more than likely be charged only one administration charge in those circumstances by the fund, but there are some exceptions. So just because you have two different jobs, particularly in the same industry, does not mean that you are in two different funds. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Margetts" NAMEID="DX5">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just about to get to that. Let us assume that you are in two, three or four different funds&mdash;and that is possible, particularly if you are a part-time or casual employee. If you have moneys going into different funds, by the nature of your employment it is likely that you move from job to job. Casual and part-time employment tends to be more transient than full-time. When you leave a job, you are able to transfer the money over from that fund or those two or three funds and consolidate it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the unfortunate things is that a lot of people are not aware of their ability to transfer and consolidate their money on leaving a job. The consolidation issue and protection of small amounts in those circumstances, if a person does not consolidate through lack of awareness of consolidation, is dealt with by the member protection of small superannuation accounts. We have recognised that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general issue of small amounts will become less of a problem over time. Most funds charge a flat fee, which is usually between 60c and a dollar a week. That fee does not increase as the contributions increase. At the moment employer contributions are either four or five per cent, depending on the employer's payroll; that rises to nine per cent under the superannuation guarantee. With the recent announcements in the budget, there will be a further six per cent, taking the contributions going into the fund or funds to a total of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration charge does not rise as the contributions rise. So the administration charge as a proportion of contributions&mdash;anywhere between 50c and a dollar a week&mdash;will decline over time, and the problem of small amounts will decline over time. But there will still be a problem with small amounts, albeit less of a problem over time. That is what this package of measures is designed to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts has also raised the issue of investment. We have indicated that the moneys will be invested in government bonds&mdash;securities of that nature. This government has no intention of investing the moneys in broader forms of investment&mdash;that is, in what may concern you as being of a more speculative nature. If it did, I am advised that the Senate could disallow any attempt to do so. We would obviously debate that issue, but the Senate would have the power to disallow any broader form of investment through regulation in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the budget announcement of the additional six per cent, there will need to be some legislation. I cannot give you the date on which that will be presented to the Senate, but there will have to be legislation at some time in the future. Therefore, the Senate will have an opportunity to debate this, just as we have debated very regularly over the last five or six years superannuation and the specific provisions as they have changed over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also able to indicate for the record that, whilst we will not accept Senator Watson's amendment which is to do away with the holding accounts reserve automatically at the end of two years, we are willing to accept&mdash;and I am not sure in what form it will be&mdash;and agree to a review of the operation of the holding accounts reserve and a report back obviously to the Senate, and I am sure that would be back to the House of Representatives as well, within that two year period. I think they are the issues that have been raised in the debate. I thank the senators for their contributions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise an issue that I raised at one of the committee hearings with the tax office. I am not sure what part of the bill will overcome the problem that I want to address. The situation is that a casual employee has three or four employers, and the amounts that are due to be paid into superannuation are so small that he chooses to pay them into the holding account at the tax office. Over a period of time, the amount from those four different employers builds up to $1,200. He can either leave it there, attracting no interest, or he can take that $1,200 out and put it into one of the four funds that he would have a choice of because the amount is up to $1,200. He would then have to proceed with the remaining three employers to start all over again with the tax office until he builds another amount up to $1,200. Can you clarify that position?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the moneys going into the holding account, there are no charges up to $1,200. If the tax office notifies the individual that there is now $1,200 in his account, the individual can choose any one of a number of funds to put the money into, provided he is legally able to access that fund. It could be that he transfers the $1,200 over to one of the three or four industry funds he can access. I think, in those circumstances, it is likely that the employee would go to the two, three or four employers&mdash;if he is still employed by them&mdash;and ask them to pay the money into the fund that he has directed the money should go to. I am also advised that, under the transfer protocol, if the employee decides it should go into X fund, any further moneys going into the superannuation holding account from the employers will automatically flow over. It will not be held in the holding reserve account.</PARA></TALK.START>

Once the amount gets to $1,200 and the employee is notified and withdraws the money and puts it into a fund&mdash;regardless of what that fund is&mdash;are you saying that, if the employers from the other casual jobs wish to continue paying, they can continue to pay into the tax office and the tax office will automatically transfer that money to the existing fund?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us understand that the three or four employers are putting the money into the holding accounts reserve because there may not be a particular industry fund covering their particular industry. Their industry may not have a fund for a particular reason, whether it is to do with the industrial award or the particular nature of the employment. Therefore, I think the employee, upon having knowledge of a fund that the money should go to, would go back to those employers and ask them to pay the money into the particular fund that he or she has nominated. I think that is the likely scenario.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the employer did not, the employee would certainly have to notify the tax office to pay the money into that particular fund.

Therefore, if those three or four employers are putting money into the superannuation holding accounts reserve that will continue.

I must say that David has made a significant contribution over the years, as far as the opposition is concerned, to the whole question of retirement incomes policy and superannuation in particular. I think it is regrettable that, arising from the preselection process, quite eminent people from time to time either get dumped or get put in positions where they cannot necessarily win. Nevertheless, we all have fighting qualities and those of us who believe we have a chance obviously will be working to that end. </PARA>

I speak on behalf of a wide sector of the industry when I say that it has the highest regard for what David has done and what he is doing.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AIRCRAFT NOISE LEVY BILL</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to provide for the imposition of a levy on jet aircraft landings at airports where noise amelioration programs are being funded by the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will be aware that construction of a new parallel runway at Sydney Airport was completed during 1994 and the runway came into operation in November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the recently installed air traffic control system is operating at full capacity, the traffic handling capacity of the new runway configuration will be about 80 aircraft movements per hour compared with 55 movements per hour prior to the commissioning of the new runway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the operation of the new parallel runway configuration significantly reduces the overall number of people seriously affected by aircraft noise, particularly those to the east and west of the Airport, it significantly increases the level of noise exposure for residents of some other areas mainly to the north of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising that this would be the case, the Government in 1991 commissioned a Steering Committee, convened by the Federal Airports Corporation, to prepare a Noise Management Plan for Sydney Airport identifying possible measures to mitigate the noise impact of the new runway operation. A Draft Noise Management Plan was subsequently developed with extensive involvement by the three levels of government, the community and the airline industry. The Draft Plan was released for public comment in June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After considering measures proposed in the Draft Noise Management Plan, the Government announced late last year that it would undertake a major program of acquisition and acoustic insulation of certain buildings in the areas worst affected by noise from the operation of the Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government has initiated a range of other measures, including mandatory flightpaths, take-off procedures for jet aircraft and tighter curfew arrangements to minimise the number of people affected by aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acquisition and insulation program encompasses voluntary acquisition of up to 113 residential properties within the 40 Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) zone;  sound insulation of some 4,200 residential properties within the 30 ANEF zone;  and sound insulation of schools and colleges, child care facilities, hospitals and health care facilities and churches within the 25 ANEF zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope of eligibility for this program is at least equal to that of any major overseas airport where a noise amelioration program is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's intention that the announced program be completed within a three year period. This again compares favourably with the rate of implementation of overseas programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on indicative cost data developed in conjunction with the Draft Noise Management Plan, the cost of the program was originally estimated at some $183 million. Following a re-assessment of eligible buildings and the scope and cost of required works, the estimated overall cost of the program is now $260 million (in 1995-96 prices).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The airlines and their passengers will be the beneficiaries of the increased runway capacity created at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows that they should be required to meet the cost of reducing the noise impacts on the affected communities in the vicinity of the Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy which this bill seeks to impose will provide the means for giving effect to this principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that the levy will apply only at declared airports, which are those where the following conditions apply</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy will apply in the first instance to Sydney Airport only. This recognises the very significant change in noise patterns around the airport which results from the opening of the new runway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government would similarly expect that, where new runway developments or extensions enabling a significant change in either the number or type of jet aircraft usage occur at other major airports, the need for a noise amelioration program will also arise. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will be aware that the Government has embarked on a program of leasing Federal airports. As part of the next stage of the disposal process, the Government will examine how best to ensure responsible environmental behaviour by users and operators of leased airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prospective airport operators will clearly have an interest in the development of environmental management measures, including noise amelioration, which may be warranted by significant runway works and changes in operations at the airports they will be leasing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues will therefore be addressed in the context of the airport leasing program which will see the first of our major Federal airports leased in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the levy itself, the amount of levy payable per jet aircraft landing will be determined according to a formula developed as part of the Sydney Airport Draft Noise Management Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formula provides that the noisier an aircraft the higher will be the rate of levy payable per landing. For example, the amount of levy payable for a landing by a B747 will be some three to four times higher than for a B737 depending on the specific noise characteristics of the particular aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the levy to apply to landings by jet aircraft only. This reflects the fact that generally jet aircraft create greater noise disturbance than propeller driven aircraft. There will be some quieter small jet aircraft which are not liable for the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a requirement of the bill that revenue from the levy at a particular declared airport not exceed the cost of the noise amelioration program at that airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To spread the cost impact on airlines, it is not envisaged that the levy will necessarily be raised at a rate which keeps pace with spending on a noise amelioration program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy rate will be prescribed by regulation subject to the limitations established in the bill. It is proposed that there will be automatic annual adjustments of the levy rates in line with Consumer Price Index movements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate will also be periodically reviewed in the light of other parameters such as growth rates in jet aircraft landings and the costs of noise amelioration programs that might be established at any other airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's intention that the rate of levy be initially set at an amount of $155 per noise unit. This rate will be adjusted as necessary so as to enable the cost of the Sydney Airport Noise Amelioration Program to be recovered over a period of up to ten years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995/96, it is expected that the levy will raise some $32.2 million. This translates to an average cost per jet aircraft passenger landing at Sydney Airport of around $3.40.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this is a landmark bill. It establishes a regime for recovering from aviation operators the costs of redressing the adverse impact of aircraft noise imposed on communities in the vicinity of airports&mdash;immediately in the case of Sydney Airport and at other Australian airports in future years.</PARA>

So, while the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been in charge of the government, the Commonwealth has made a massive increase in debt&mdash;from approximately $33 billion to $95 billion over just four years. This bill authorises the government to go ahead and borrow further for the next financial year. Why does it need further borrowings? Because it is running a budget deficit again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt at all that this government has been very slack with regard to its running of the economy, the budget which has just been announced and is currently going through the parliament, and the last budget of the current financial year. Both budgets should have been either neutral or in surplus&mdash;not deficits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just extraordinary that here we have an economy which is sucking in every month imports worth $2 billion or more and yet the government continues to go on borrowing, taking further resources out of the private sector. In this current budget we are increasing taxes by a massive amount&mdash;nearly 13 per cent. We are increasing spending by a similar amount. The government, instead of cutting spending and staying within its income, continues to want further borrowings. That is what this bill is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the total Commonwealth debt at present is an estimated $95 billion. It will increase further in the next financial year. The interest payments on that debt are rising steadily. Last year they were $7.2 billion. The estimate for the next financial year is $9.4 billion. That massive sum of interest on borrowings is nearly equal to the total defence budget and only slightly less than the total education budget expenditure. So we have payments on debt by the Commonwealth of nearly a massive $10 billion per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be running surpluses. We have known for years that we need to increase savings within the economy. We have known for years that we are basically building up to a current account deficit problem. What has the government done? There has been more taxing, more spending and further deficits. This government should be condemned. It has no concern about the longer term environment for investment, jobs growth and economic growth for this economy. I take this opportunity to condemn the government for the way it is handling the economy. </PARA>

The remainder of the money is appropriated through other acts such as the Social Security Act, to name but one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak today about the setting of the 1995-96 budget as a whole, its propriety and its relevance to the economic and social needs of our nation and our people. On all three grounds this budget, I would have to say, fails miserably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is entirely inappropriate to the needs of Australia today. It is a budget based on broken promises, tax lies and deceit. It is a high taxing budget. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has now become one of Australia's highest taxing prime ministers. He holds the undisputed record as the Prime Minister who has broken more promises than any other Prime Minister in our history. Some record! This Prime Minister simply cannot be trusted in anything that he says. His record, particularly in the field of taxation, bears eloquent testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget imposes savage tax increases on business and consumers. It makes it more difficult for business to employ more people. It reduces the available incomes of every Australian. It contains the seeds of inflationary pressures and of interest rate rises. It sells off two prize pieces of the family silver&mdash;namely, 50 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas Airways&mdash;simply to pay for the government's groceries, its day-to-day expenses, rather than to pay off the enormous debt that this government has accumulated, a debt that has risen in the last four to five years alone from $30 billion to a figure in the order of $100 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget does nothing to address our crisis level deficit in our external accounts. It makes the closing of that gaping hole all the more difficult because it has made it even more difficult for our producers of goods and services to be as internationally competitive as they need to be if our living standards are to increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has guaranteed that we will rack up increasing amounts of foreign debt and other liabilities and thus reduce our sovereignty and true national independence. There is no surer way of reducing one's national sovereignty than to put our country increasingly in hock to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the budget of a deceitful and incompetent government of economic failure and broken promises. The budget itself is built on very dubious forecasts. In particular, the forecasts for the growth in the national product of 3 3/4per cent during 1995-96 is a figure that must be taken with an increasingly large grain of salt. There is clear evidence, in talking with businesses and business associations and their members, that the business climate appears to have weakened sharply in recent weeks. The 3 3/4per cent forecast could well prove to be optimistic, and the implications of that for jobs is of great concern. Even at a growth of 3 3/4per cent next year, an insufficient number of jobs would be created to meet the growth in the available work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that the Prime Minister, at the time of his One Nation statement, said that Australia needed 4 1/2 per cent annual growth to provide the necessary number of jobs to at least start to make a hole in the unemployment figures and to provide the necessary jobs for those coming newly into the work force. In the Treasury estimates the other day, the Treasury officers started to walk away from that commitment. They now seem to be saying that we can possibly get the necessary job growth to achieve a sustainable reduction in the level of unemployment with a figure perhaps of the order of 3 3/4 per cent&mdash;that is the one forecast in the budget. But the Treasury officers produced no hard evidence or data at all to support that backflip. It would be a major backflip from the Prime Minister's earlier One Nation statement if the government were to start down that tack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is built on broken promises. It is financed to an important extent by the Prime Minister's broken promise to provide significant tax cuts to every Australian on 1 January 1996. Remember that that tax cut was enshrined in legislation before the 1993 federal election. I am sure everyone remembers how the Prime Minister said that those tax cuts were l-a-w&mdash;law. Equally, people will remember how he attempted to ridicule those who questioned his commitment to those 1 January 1996 tax cut promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have all known for some time, it has now been confirmed in this budget that what was l-a-w has turned out not to be l-a-w but l-i-e. Those tax cuts have gone. Technically, the government says that they have been deferred and are going to be switched into a contribution towards superannuation for employees. But even if we accept that as a proposition, those tax cuts have been deferred for up to 45 years or more&mdash;up to 45 years or more&mdash;by the introduction of a compulsory employee superannuation levy to be matched in a few years time by government contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we would all agree that the encouragement of superannuation is desirable, it should not be achieved by the flagrant, blatant and cynical breaking of tax cut promises solemnly given on the eve of an election, as was the case with this duplicitous government prior to the 1993 election. If l-a-w is law, it should be honoured. The respect for and the integrity of the government of the day should not be shattered by broken promises by transforming l-a-w into l-i-e in the way that this government does as a matter of routine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should also heed the warning, in the context of its savings proposals, of one of the architects of its savings policies, Dr Vince Fitzgerald: without new incentives to save&mdash;and there are none in this budget&mdash;then workers will merely reduce other forms of savings to meet the new compulsory superannuation levy on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must also be pointed out that the government's new compulsory savings arrangements will do nothing at all to assist or in any way benefit large sections of the community, particularly self-funded retirees. Indeed, such people will be penalised because they will have to pay more tax to subsidise those people who receive the government's matching contribution in the years to come. Those existing retirees and those who are approaching retirement have lost forever the tax cut that they were promised they would receive on 1 January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures surrounding this budget are in many ways cooked figures. The government has recorded a so-called surplus of $718 million for the forthcoming financial year by cooking the books. It has cooked the books in various ways. The most important way in which it has done that is by including $5.3 billion&mdash;that is, $5,300 million&mdash;of once only asset sales. It has done this in a way in which the sales and sale conditions, which were explicitly ruled out by the government both before the last election and before the budget, have been transformed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in particular to the government's decision now to sell the remaining 50 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. According to the then finance minister, Mr Willis, a couple of years ago when the government sold off its second tranche of 19 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, the government had given a cast-iron guarantee that it would under no circumstances whatsoever contemplate selling off any of the remaining 50 per cent. Yet in this budget it has announced that it will sell off the whole of the remaining 50 per cent. It is doing that simply because it is desperate to find some cash to fill that gaping hole in its accounts. It has also been forced&mdash;the coalition does not object to this; indeed, we told the government a year ago that it would probably need to do this&mdash;to increase the foreign ownership provisions of Qantas in advance of the forthcoming Qantas float to try again in a desperate bid to get more money into its coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real budget deficit is tucked away at the back of the budget papers. There are literally 1,000 pages of budget papers, and right down there in the last 50 pages or so you find the real budget outcome, as measured by the government's own official Bureau of Statistics. The real outcome is a budget deficit is $8.3 billion. It is not a surplus of $718 million, as the government portrayed on budget night. That $718 million surplus is a figure that has been struck after adjustments from accounting tricks and fiddles; the proceeds of asset sales; and, as I said, the cancelling of the significant $4 billion to $5 billion tax cut that the government promised that Australian taxpayers would receive from 1 January next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the highest taxing budgets that we have seen in our history. The real growth in revenue in 1995-96, as shown in the budget, is going to be 7.9 per cent. That follows growth in the year just being completed of 8.9 per cent. When you take account of inflation, the actual increases each year were several percentage points more than that. If we put together the figures for this year that has just been completed and the year we are just about to start, which the budget is all about, we have the highest growth in two consecutive years in government revenue&mdash;the government tax take&mdash;since the infamous Whitlam budgets of 1973 and 1974 which absolutely wrecked the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this coming year alone, 1995-96, the government is going to rip off the Australian taxpayer an additional $14,200 million&mdash;a huge amount. Personal income tax is set to rise by 13 1/2 per cent. Indirect taxes are going to go up by about 15 per cent. This budget, which will have an effect over the next four years, increases taxes by $17,000 million. Compare that with the Prime Minister's promise at the last election of $14 billion of tax cuts over four years. What he is going to deliver over that same period is tax rises of $18 billion. In other words, the difference between what we have at the end of those four years and what he promised at the start, will be a $32 billion higher tax take by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating now has the uncontested title of the Prince of Broken Promises. I have already outlined some of these broken promises. He also promised before the last election not to put up tax as a proportion of national income. First of all, he said he was not going to put up tax at all and then he hedged his bets and said, `I really mean I won't put it up as a proportion of our total annual national income.' That is another broken promise. In the year in which he made that promise, tax revenue equalled 22.1 per cent of GDP; for the year ahead, the tax revenue is forecast to equal 24.2 per cent of GDP. So an extra 2.1 per cent of GDP is going to go in taxes and that, when translated into cold hard dollars, is more than $10,000 million of additional tax for that reason alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also promised not to put up or to broaden indirect taxes. Since then, we have seen in the last couple of budgets and/or the budget we are now debating, sales tax rates up two per cent across the board. That was in the 1993 budget with effect over a couple of years, the next effect being from 1 July this year. We have seen the sales tax on cars go up in this budget from 15 or 16 per cent to 21 per cent, which is an increase of five per cent in the tax rate and an increase of 30 per cent in the amount taken in sales tax. We have seen certain building materials subject for the first time to a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax. Indeed, sales tax by the end of the coming financial year will have increased by 52 per cent since 1993 and, even after taking out inflation, it will have increased by 43.9 per cent&mdash;an absolutely staggering increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government promised to cut company tax before the last election, and it did. That promise lasted for two years. This budget has now increased company sales tax by another three percentage points, from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, which is a proportionate increase of nine per cent. The election promise to cut personal income tax, which I have mentioned, is perhaps the daddy of them all, in terms of broken promises, but there are many others as well. There was an election promise not to put up the Medicare levy further. What happened? This budget has increased the Medicare levy. And so on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget hits the typical Australian family, the so-called battler, in a way that is almost unprecedented. The battler in Australia under this government has now become the battered. That applies across the board, but particularly to families and small businesses. The complacency of this government in its approach to the real financial and economic needs of this country is absolutely staggering and a matter of the gravest concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: this budget is a bad budget. It is inappropriate for the needs of Australia today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appropriation bills for 1995-96 represent the 13th budget of this Labor government. On 13 occasions this government has brought before this chamber these appropriation bills which are, in effect, statements of financial intent. They are statements of how the government intends to operate within the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the length of time that this government has been in charge of this country's economy, now is an appropriate&mdash;indeed, an essential&mdash;moment to stop and take a good hard look at the economic health of the nation. It is a chance to consider how well served by the government sector are the Australian people. As the owners and shareholders of the wealth of our nation, the Australian public deserves a clear and unambiguous report of the nation's condition. It is no more than any other shareholder in a company would demand, and it is no more than they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic therefore that the first point I regrettably feel I have to make is that, on any reasonable and fair assessment, the accounting reporting mechanisms underlying this budget are, at best, unhelpful and, at worse, misleading. It is not possible for all shareholders, all the Australian public, to understand the budget papers. As these reports are the most visible and public representation of the government's accounts, it is unreasonable to expect that members of the general public should essentially have to have an honours degree in accounting theory to be able to disentangle them and appreciate their meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these comments without&mdash;and I stress this point&mdash;any criticism, implied or otherwise, of the Department of Finance or other officers who are responsible for preparing the budget papers. Those officers are professionals. They deserve credit for the task that they undertake. It must be extremely hard for these officers, when critical decisions affecting the budget's figuring and the explanatory text are not included until four days before the budget is to be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are clearly two factors affecting the work of these people. The first is the very complexities of government accounting&mdash;and I know that the Department of Finance has commenced work on whole of government reporting in the context of the development of accrual accounting. I believe that this work will be earnestly and genuinely progressed, and I wish the officers well in this task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second factor impinging on the quality of the reports is the influence of the government over the structures of the reports. As the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has often boasted, the budget papers are the government's and, consequently, the format of reports and the text of reports are ultimately the responsibility of the government. I have no problem with this arrangement other than to note the capacity of a government to spin a picture to the public in the budget papers that is most favourable to its political fortunes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What alternative is there to these current arrangements? I argue that the only real alternative to the present arrangements commences with the adoption, as a first principle, of the goal of transparency in respect of financial reporting. This would require that the operations and deliberations of central economic agencies be made more open and accountable to the public. Judgment of these agencies should be fully contestable in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While, as I have already stated, I have no fundamental problem with the government of the day including its estimates of the core economic indicators in the budget papers, I do not believe that the public should be misled into believing these estimates are the considered judgments of the professionals in the Treasury. It is possible, I suppose, that the backroom staff of the Prime Minister's office may be better at predicting the future economic performance of Australia than the 500 staff of Treasury. It may even be possible that these same staff from the Prime Minister's office have superior economic skills to those of the entire private sector, such is the science of economic forecasting. Nevertheless, when the numbers in the budget papers are not those proposed by the Treasury, let the government clearly say so; let the government be honest with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, the budget papers should clearly enunciate any qualifications in the accounting basis of the budget reports. I acknowledge that these qualifications are included in the budget papers, but they are not up-front nor are they particularly clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the first formal mention of budget surplus this year appears on page 1-1 of budget statement No. 1 in budget paper No. 1. However, it is not until page 7-2 in statement No. 2 of budget paper No. 1, some 399 pages later, that the budget papers define what the reported surplus means and notes that there are alternative measures which actually indicate that the budget is in deficit&mdash;such as the ABS budget deficit and the adjusted ABS budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In estimate hearings recently, Deputy Secretary Thorn of the Department of Finance summed up the situation quite well when, in respect of what the various measures of the structural deficit meant, he stated, `Different things to different people.' Senator McMullan also indicated on that night, `I do not think that is a problem as long as people explain what they mean when they are using it.' I agree with Senator McMullan that it is important to be clear to all what a reported statistic means. I do, however, believe that there should be a clear and unequivocal agreement as to what reported figures in the Commonwealth budget mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, I believe the budget should split the current and capital accounts in a manner that is generally accepted, both in the accounting profession and in a fashion that would produce reports that are generally understandable to the non-technically literate general public. I note that I have raised with the Department of Finance other matters in regard to the presentation of the budget papers. I am pleased to say that the department has agreed to investigate that and consider it for future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to explore what the figures reported in this budget mean for Australia. I begin with the broad statistics indicating the general state of the economy of Australia. Australia is deeply in debt. We owe the world a vast sum of money. At the end of March this year, the net foreign liabilities of Australian residents totalled $244,125 million. Of these liabilities, net foreign debt represented $166,919 million. That is the amount Australians owed to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in the March quarter, Australia made payments totalling $5.8 billion in respect of income payable on foreign investment in Australia. For the first three-quarters of this financial year, the income payable by Australia on foreign investments has totalled $16.9 billion. This is a disturbing and negligent situation to be in. A debt of this proportion is no gift to our future generations. It is a shackle that, no matter what our constitutional arrangements, will constrain the hopes and aspirations of our children and sadly our children's children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the world has reacted to Australia's debt and the policies that the government has put in place to respond to the level of our debt. The value of Australia's currency&mdash;our Australian dollar&mdash;when compared with the currencies of the rest of the world is a clear indication of how the rest of the world values our economy. At present, on a trade weighted index, our currency hovers with a nervous pulse just above its lowest level ever. In fact, our dollar has even depreciated 13 per cent against the New Zealand dollar since Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestically, the measures of Australia's economic performance are not too promising. At the broad level, our inflation rate is increasing. Australians will have to pay more for their goods and services over the next year. They will need to dig deeper into their savings to pay for the essentials of life. Unfortunately, those savings are declining at an alarming rate. Latest figures suggest that household savings are at their lowest level ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next 12 months, it is forecast that more Australians will have gainful employment. However, recent statistics show that in large measure these new jobs will be part time. This means that, while our pool of unemployed continues to grow, our pool of underemployed also increases. Once again, this is a waste of our most valuable resource and a cause for great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make matters worse for the unemployed, it now seems that a myth is developing among certain sections of the media&mdash;no doubt led and encouraged by elements of the government's propaganda arm&mdash;to the effect that unemployment is not such a big problem and that everyone can have a job if they want it. This perverse manipulation of the Australian public's heart and soul is not merely deplorable but is absolutely dangerous. It opens the potential for the Australian community to walk away from their unemployed brothers and sisters with reckless abandon. Let it be clearly and unequivocally understood that the number one social and economic concern of this country must be ensuring employment for all those who want to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now for the broad initiatives this government has delivered for Australia. Government revenue, that is, money obtained from the Australian people, is forecast to rise by 12.8 per cent in nominal terms, or 8.9 per cent in real growth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first home owners scheme commenced on 1 October 1983 and provided assistance in the form of a subsidy towards mortgage repayments to those on low to moderate incomes to enable them to buy or build their first home. The coalition parties will not be opposing the bill as we have consistently believed the principle behind the devolution of the first home owners scheme to the states is correct and that these amendments are only to finalise a process begun by the First Home Owners Amendment Act 1990 which we did not oppose at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will now turn my comments to reflect on the position of home ownership. I think it is important to note that home ownership dominates Australia's housing picture. It is well documented that 96 per cent of Australians aspire to be home owners, and there is evidence that around 70 per cent of Australia's population either own a home or are in the process of purchasing one. Therefore, this preference for home ownership by an overwhelming majority of Australians does play an important role in making housing affordable during the course of their lives. All governments must take this preference seriously when framing overall housing policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home ownership provides financial security for home owners and families and security of tenure. Home ownership also encourages savings and independence and instils a sense of pride and achievement. It is, of course, particularly relevant to people at the point where they retire or change their circumstances at a mature age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The main issue affecting home buyers, particularly the first home buyer, remains affordability. Affordability depends largely on interest rates, real incomes and house prices. Changes in these factors, any one of them, affect the borrowing and purchasing power of potential home buyers. Increasing the level of home purchase amongst low income earners would reduce the demand for public housing and the associated costs on government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look for a moment at the Labor Party's economic environment and housing policy issues, there are a lot of issues that we need to address. We have now seen more than a decade of economic instability and volatility. We have seen a period of interest rate uncertainty and constant speculation. We have seen a sharp decline in housing finance commitments and building approvals. Building industry activity certainly is slowing, and this has become very obvious in recent time. As builders naturally rationalise their businesses, there are consequential job losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this decade of Labor we have also seen very inconsistent strategies on high deficits. We have seen increased levels of uncertainty about future employment and expected income, particularly for lower income earners. We have seen increased inequality in the distribution of income amongst households throughout Australia and certainly a widening gap between mortgage loan repayments and wages in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, probably one of the major recent factors that are in the minds of many people is that Labor's budget of several weeks ago imposed a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax on certain building materials, higher sales taxes on vehicles, and higher company taxes&mdash;a double whammy, with accelerated payment schedules which may force smaller companies to lift prices further. We have also seen the announcement in the last week or so of significant changes in the area of termite control for housing activity. This will have consequential effects by again forcing up prices and housing. In the community there is a mistrust of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and his ministers on issues that relate to home purchase and the consequences that flow through to other families in the community who must rent their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amidst this environment of instability and volatility, Australians want to, and must, embark on the road of home purchase. First home buyers in the 1990s face many crucial decisions to enable them to achieve home purchase. They are more than likely to be two-income households. The female participation and spouse employment issues have now become profound in the community. Today Australian families will be prepared to delay having children. They will be prepared to buy in the outer suburbs, where housing is more than likely to be affordable. They will trade the distance to work and home size to achieve home ownership. And many Australians acknowledge there will be a limited cash flow for recreation and leisure as a result of their decisions to be involved in home purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very interesting work was done recently by National Shelter on the cost of housing. In April of this year it had a report launched by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, Mr Howe. A fundamental question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How do economic conditions impact on home ownership?</PARA>
<PARA>I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally, people are tenacious in hanging on to homes despite income-to-housing cost ratios. This means housing costs can swallow huge slabs of income to the detriment of other essential needs.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Home buyers in the lowest 40 per cent of income distribution are paying between 16 and 37 per cent of their gross incomes on housing, with many people paying over 30 per cent. Among low-income home purchases, financial problems are worst among poorer single women who pay on average 37.7 per cent of income on housing.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating and Mr Howe showed little concern for the low to middle income home buyers when the government recently manipulated increases in interest rates. Certainly the consequences that flow from the wholesale sales tax on building materials not only will affect low and middle income groups but will very much affect groups in the community such as the ageing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to consider the circumstances of many people who are choosing to retire and how often at that point in their life cycle people choose either to purchase a new home, and therefore suffer additional costs, or to embark on a period of renovation or adaption of their homes. Of course, there is no compensation in this year's budget for any of these people to assist them. This is a real slap in the face to many such people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real tragedy for the nation is that the actions of the Prime Minister are motivated by a desire to stay in power rather than weigh up and properly balance the issues that should be addressed in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to looking at issues of housing, I am often asked: where is the Deputy Prime Minister, the housing minister, Mr Howe? When did the housing minister make a statement on the decline of housing affordability and/or home ownership? His department and a number of agencies have done a lot of work in addressing a lot of reports, but not one bit of it has ended up on the action table of the minister or in the budget statements of the government. There is a plethora of reports. Mr Howe has buried himself in this plethora of reports, strategies, visions, inquiries, agendas and reviews. The lucrative growth industry in construction and housing these days is not in building activity but in the work of consultants under the housing minister, Mr Howe. What are the results of these reports, strategies, visions, inquiries and reviews?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for Mr Howe, on almost a weekly basis, to come out with a new initiative, a new dream, but none of them are transposing into action programs that can be assessed as an improvement in the cost of housing or an improvement in the service delivery to people in tenancies or homes around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe has constantly refused to acknowledge the impact his government's interest rate, high deficit and employment policies have on hundreds of thousands of Australian families. He has been ineffective and has shown absolutely no leadership in recognising the aspirations of Australians who wish to own their own homes or who are forced to accept the consequences of higher rent costs for those who cannot get into the home ownership cycle. Neither Mr Keating nor his housing minister offer any comfort to Australian home buyers and home owners&mdash;or, for that matter, home tenants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that home ownership is under attack by Mr Howe, Mr Keating and the Labor government. The truth is that the Keating Labor government failed to keep its 1993 election promise to keep home purchase within the reach of those who want to buy their own home and to keep mortgage repayments at affordable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison, let me take the bait of some of my Labor Party colleagues opposite who often ask what a coalition government would do in this area. Let me give the assurance that we will establish a flexible, balanced response to the housing sector which can deliver home ownership as a real choice. We will provide alternative options for those who choose not to own or whose circumstances prevent them from owning their own home. We will operate economic policies that will ease the pressure on interest rates. That is the fundamental cost that underpins home ownership, home participation and home affordability in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will develop innovative reforms of financial arrangements in partnership with financial and industry groups in order to assist home buyers. A Liberal-National Party government will not neglect nor turn its back on the Australian community or the hundreds and thousands of Australian families currently sitting on the public housing lists or seeking to participate in an active form of home ownership. We would certainly deliver. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is a relatively uncontroversial piece of legislation which, in the view of the Australian Democrats, the Senate should process with the minimum of fuss&mdash;considering the amount of work we have before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to make minor administrative amendments to two acts&mdash;or, to be more accurate, to one act and a bracket of acts. The first act to be amended is the Housing Assistance Act 1989. The second is the First Home Owners Act 1983 and other legislation related to its purpose, namely, the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982, the Home Savings Grant Act 1964 and the Homes Savings Grant Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Housing Assistance Act 1989 extend a waiver, which was legislated last year, to allow the Commonwealth to provide the maximum level of financial assistance for housing it has set aside for a particular state without that state having to match the contribution, as is required under the act. The background to this is that the Commonwealth provides untied financial assistance to the states under the Housing Assistance Act to deliver housing assistance, predominantly for building or purchase of public rental housing stock but also for home purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The current agreement is at schedule 1 of the existing act; the agreement is currently up for renegotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth-state housing agreement requires states to match Commonwealth untied assistance on a dollar for dollar basis, with at least half of the matching provided through state grants and the balance through the value of loans made under various home purchase assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Difficulties with matching have apparently arisen in recent years for states as a result of a number of factors, including that great euphemism `changed market conditions', which is code for messing up their schemes. New South Wales is the best example. The affected states just have to say that they have been unable to provide additional grant funding to meet their matching obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the amendments made to the act last year, the Commonwealth was required to recover financial assistance provided in earlier years from states which did not undertake sufficient lending under their home purchase assistance schemes. Similarly, where some states indicated that they were unlikely to be able to meet their matching requirements, the act, prior to amendment, required that the minister not provide unmatched funds, reducing untied grants to the level that would therefore be matched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says it considered that either to recover financial assistance already provided or to reduce funding to be provided was undesirable. The Democrats would certainly agree. We believe that the level of funding, particularly for public housing, is already too low. To claw back or reduce funding would further disadvantage those very Australians most in need of assistance. In fact, due to funding cuts, public sector housing commencements have fallen by about 25 per cent over the past three years&mdash;and that number is still falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public sector housing commencements were 11,998 in 1991-92; that dropped to 10,401 in 1992-93; that dropped again to only 8,272 in 1993-94; we are now looking at another drop to an estimated figure which is around the 6,800 mark in 1994-95. Over the same period public housing waiting lists have gone from 202,000 in 1990-91 to 216,000 in 1991-92 and to 232,000, nationally, as at 30 June 1993, the last available figure. We have to ask the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe): whose responsibility is this, minister? Yours? The states? Does it fall somewhere between the chairs? Surely it is about time somebody put up their hand and actually took responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing we do know for certain is that, on top of these figures, changes the government is seeking to make to rental assistance and other measures in this budget will certainly leave at least 410,000 people worse off. But more of that when the time comes, when we discuss the budget bills in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did not expect at the time of the previous amendments that states would continue to have problems matching. Apparently they still do. So the amendments outlined in this bill extend these matching/waiving provisions for what is expected to be the final, and seventh year, of the current agreement. To coin a phrase, it is a matter of not matching/waiving, and the question must be asked of the states: why are they not matching?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says any decision to waive or reduce home purchase assistance requirements will be taken only after careful consideration of the circumstances leading to the need for such a course of action, and that that will occur on a case-by-case basis. The government also says the issue of matching will be addressed in the process of renegotiation of a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the minister to reaffirm that the issue will indeed be addressed and to assure the Senate that states are not being allowed to shirk their commitment to public housing assistance simply as a matter of political expediency. In other words, their lack of matching funding has transparent, genuine reasons attached, not just poor excuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the bill before us concerns the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation. The amendments are only to finalise a process begun by the First Home Owners Amendment Act 1990, which came out of the 1990 budget. Back then the government announced its decision to terminate the first home owners scheme as a part of its plan to restructure the Commonwealth home ownership assistance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation was introduced amending the First Home Owners Act 1983 so that it would not have effect in respect of homes acquired after that date. That legislation also fixed 30 June 1991 as the last date for applications for assistance under the act. However, applicants coming within those deadlines remained eligible for a stream of monthly assistance payments over five years from the date of acquiring their home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in 1994 to the first home owners regulations allowed final payments to remaining eligible clients to be aggregated and brought forward. The bulk of these payments was made in November 1994. After 30 June 1995 there will be ongoing administrative activity only, of a minor administrative nature. In other words, the scheme has been wound up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, this bill amends the reporting requirements of the act to provide that no annual report on its administration and operation will be required after the 1994-95 report. This is entirely sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments are included which are simply to tidy up outstanding loose ends. These include setting a deadline for appeals under the scheme and adjusting the secretary's power to prevent re-opening of appeals. For the very few decisions still to be made, normal rights of review and appeal via the AAT are retained, and clients will be notified of the new set of time lines before appeal rights expire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government announced its decision to abolish the first home owners scheme the Democrats did not oppose it. We were, however, critical of the government's commitment to that scheme and to housing assistance in general. Nothing has changed to dispel that criticism. The cuts continue&mdash;cuts to public sector housing grants and now also to rent assistance. Those cuts are compounded by the continuing effects of financial deregulation, the result of which has been for the government to blithely allow the banks to keep their rates far higher than they should be; and at the same time to jack up fees on a whole range of different transactions and, for a whole range of reasons, on bank accounts of ordinary Australians. Your policies have literally given the banks a licence to print money&mdash;that is, profits&mdash;for themselves at the expense of Australian citizens generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Democrats support this bill, we put the government on notice that rhetoric can get you only so far. Eventually the people of this nation, as they did in the Canberra by-election, will tire of tricks and look at the real bottom line. Time is running out for you to get it right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These bills establish the basis for a national uniform heavy road vehicle registration charging scheme. The collection of charges under the scheme will contribute to recovery of the costs of wear caused by the operation of heavy vehicles. Amounts equivalent to the charges will be paid to the interstate road transport fund and distributed to the states and territories for the maintenance and upkeep of roads used by heavy vehicles. This is part of the reform processes developed by the National Road Transport Commission under the mandate of the Australian Transport Council, which is made up of Commonwealth, state and territory ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an example of pegged legislation, where the Commonwealth passes legislation to apply in its jurisdiction and the states and territories pass similar legislation in their jurisdictions. It used to be called mirror legislation. The charges which are the subject of this bill are due to take effect on 1 July 1995. Similar legislation has already been passed in relation to driver licensing and the carriage of dangerous goods. The legislation will have no budgetary impact. However, it will result in charges increasing in some jurisdictions and falling in others. The charges will be calculated on an annual basis. They are set out in the schedule, which may be amended annually, but with no greater increase or decrease than five per cent per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the removal of the option to nominate an actual distance amount as the amount of registration charge payable and for the removal of the option to pay in instalments. References to motor vehicle and trailer charge monitoring devices are also removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heavy vehicles agreement of the ministerial council foreshadowed the development of a more refined charging method following these initial changes. The new charging approach has the support of industry peak bodies, such as the Road Transport Forum, which wants a simple, uniform one-off charging system. The National Road Transport Commission has issued a discussion paper outlining options for more refined processes. This paper will be the basis of industry consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All states except New South Wales and Western Australia have strongly supported the changes. The previous New South Wales government expressed concern about the financial impact of the changes because the new charges were substantially lower than the existing charges. The new New South Wales opposition believes the changes will be revenue neutral and should proceed. However, Bob Carr, following the very poor example of his close friend, Paul Keating, promised before the New South Wales election to implement these changes by 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in true form, after the election he attached a rider saying that this would all depend on whether the other states and territories were in a position to proceed. Western Australia was originally opposed, due to the cost impact on intrastate operators. However, it has modified its opposition and is examining options for discounting the increase for intrastate operators. However, it may not be ready to proceed by 1 July. Victoria, Queensland and the ACT expect to introduce new charges by 1 July. South Australia and Tasmania are committed, but will not pass legislation until July or August. The Northern Territory will enact but not implement until other states and territories have legislation in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, this is a non-controversial bill which is supported by the opposition as an important part of the micro-economic reform process of the road transport industry. It is important that interstate truckers do not have to go through a raft of bureaucratic mazes to comply with differing state and territory laws. However, it should be pointed out that Bob Carr's about-face will cause significant problems. At the annual conference of the New South Wales Livestock Transport Association a few weeks before the New South Wales election, the ALP transport spokesman, Brian Langton, was asked whether a Carr government would implement these uniform registration charges by 1 July 1995, and his answer was that it would. Bob Carr indeed put this promise in writing to the Australian road transport forum coordinator. Now the New South Wales government is saying it will only implement it when the other states and territories do likewise. All I can say is that that is par for the course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be pointed out that the National Road Transport Commission has calculated that a user pays charge for heavy road transport vehicles equates to 18c a litre in fuel excise. At present road transport operators pay 32.5c a litre in fuel excise. There has been no attempt by the government to rebate the excess. The average semitrailer operators pay $66,400 a year in taxes and charges to the Commonwealth and the states. The 5c a litre increase in fuel excise in the 1993 budget increased this impost by $6,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is significantly decreasing the amount of money that it is spending on roads. In the 1992 budget prior to the last election, the government said it would spend some $1,600 million on roads. In this year's budget it says it will spend only $840 million. Compare this with 1982, under a coalition government, when $150 million was spent on roads, and fuel excise was 6c a litre. With those reservations, we support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, in the south-east of South Australia, the 220 kilometres of line to Mount Gambier would cost only $8 million to standardise but, because it is broad gauge, it has been cut off entirely by the standardisation of the Adelaide to Melbourne line, leaving the people and all the industries of the south-east without rail transport. Despite very considerable efforts on my part in the lead-up to the budget to get $5 million from this federal government to standardise and upgrade that line, the money has not been forthcoming. Yet the Prime Minister could pork-barrel in South Australia to the tune of $130 million within a week of the budget&mdash;an amount which did not appear anywhere in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wanted to make those few remarks on the road transport legislation to draw attention to the fact that, whilst we do not object to this legislation&mdash;it is desirable that there be legislation for uniform road charges and all the other things in the legislation&mdash;there is an urgent need for this government and the state governments to do a great deal more than they have done in the area of rail transport. </PARA>

It was interesting to hear Senator Coulter's contribution about the amount that was announced for that freeway in South Australia but which did not appear in the budget. Perhaps I should put on record here that it will probably come out of the road funding budget for Western Australia, like the $8 million last year that was put into the Subiaco oval. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Human Services and Health and member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) opened it and were grandstanding and congratulating the government about how good that $8 million for the Subiaco oval was.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill which will standardise interstate road transport for heavy vehicles, that is, anything over eight and a half tonnes, as I have had a bit to do with heavy road transport. These bills come forward at a rather unique time as only last week the first standard-gauge train went from Brisbane to Perth. Western Australia held out on this for a long time, and justifiably so because we were not going to be well treated by it in the first place, but I now welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment bill takes away the option of using the actual distance and goes to a flat licence for interstate trucks. I believe that is the way to go. For a start, measuring devices break down; secondly, they can be tampered with. There are a couple of measures I question, though. I understand there are to be no instalments for the 12-month payment of around $4,200, I believe it is, for one prime mover and one trailer. I understand there is to be one payment only. I certainly hope, if it is to be paid in one instalment&mdash;and the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) can advise me of this later&mdash;that at least it does not end up being due on a common date, say, 1 January or 1 July each year. One might say that anyone in transport who cannot afford the one-up payment should not be in transport but, if you have 50 or 60 vehicles, or even two vehicles, it is an imposition to have all the payments due on the same day of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Alston said, New South Wales was a proponent of the scheme in the first place, although it never came in. Before the election in his state Mr Carr said that New South Wales would come into the system, but he is now having second thoughts. Of course, his second thoughts are because of finances. He believes that he will lose $75 million from having these cost charges, for one prime mover with a trailer, come down to something like $4,200 from around $8,000. I am disappointed that he has done a backflip, especially since WA is now coming on board. I suppose that is what we can come to expect of Labor governments: the federal government has done this at times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Western Australia believe that the rise from $2,950 per unit to $4,200 is a massive rise. We are not happy about it. There was opposition to it, but the WA minister, as Senator Alston has said, is looking at ways to ensure that it will not affect the intrastate deal as WA relies heavily on road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the present road transport costs. The National Road Transport Commission has calculated road transport costs at about 18c per litre of diesel fuel used. Yesterday it was mentioned several times that road transporters are paying 33c per litre for on-road use, so we do not know where 14c is going. In fact we do know where it is going; it is going into government coffers. But the road transport industry believes that amount should be returned to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 18c&mdash;that is, 33c that they are paying, less the 14c it is costing them&mdash;only 7c per litre is going towards roads. We believe there should be far more than that going towards the upkeep of Australia's roads, and that that is the reason various states have had to impose their own tax. Western Australia recently imposed 4c per litre, and I believe New South Wales the same amount, due to the lack of federal funding. So this is another tax from this high taxing regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous to the last election this government was talking about a $1.5 billion allocation towards roads. After the election it came down to $840 million, exactly half of what was promised before the election. In Western Australia, because of the massive size of the state, transport is vital for resource development, for mines, for agriculture and for minerals, especially in very remote and distant areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that anywhere in New South Wales you can get more than 600 or 700 kilometres from the capital whereas, in Western Australia, you can easily get 1,600 or 1,700 kilometres from the capital. So the transport issue certainly affects us in Western Australia more than it affects everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport has improved a lot in the last 10 or 15 years with the advent, in Western Australia especially, of road trains with a second or even third trailer in various operations. Contrary to what a lot of people believe, it helps the road system because, per thousand tonne carted along a road, using multiple trailers that are lighter than a prime mover, the wear and tear on a road per kilometre will be far less than with one standard prime mover and a trailer. I do not think anyone can argue that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, to date, those road trains have had to break off 50 kilometres out of Perth&mdash;so the prime mover has to drag in one trailer and then go back and get the other. Eric Charlton, the Minister for Transport in Western Australia, is not someone I have got on well with over the years but as we get older we are learning to put up with each other. He has been a very forward thinking Minister for Transport. I must congratulate him for that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill brings all Australia under the same legislation. I certainly welcome that. It will drag New South Wales eventually into nearly the 21st century on transport. The same will happen with Victoria. Not long ago, Victoria would not allow B-doubles on its roads. They were something new. Anyone would think they had spiked wheels or ran over people at every intersection. I believe they were used as a non-tariff trade barrier. They will now be allowed because Victoria has passed the legislation&mdash;or is about to. If New South Wales comes into this system, it will also get into the 20th century.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some discussion yesterday, and the day before, on whether this should be treated as a non-contentious bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course I accept that there should be easy legislative mechanisms to process technical amendments and corrections to bills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, portfolio ministers today are responsible for a vast array of subject areas and widely disparate enactments that may be proposed for amendment&mdash;for example, the Department of Administrative Services or the portfolio of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner), which has a disparate range of interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the present case, this is compounded by the structure of the bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A responsible senator must, of course, obtain copies of all the principal acts covered by the legislation and read often obscure or unintelligible amendments against those acts. Doubts or queries that are raised on the run can be satisfied only on such examination. In the meantime, certain clear and worthy initiatives, which all members of the legislature are anxious to see implemented&mdash;there are some of those in this legislation&mdash;may be in danger of being held up. This factor may force passage despite proper doubts because we are often told, `This is an urgent bill. It has an early start up date'.

They may be amended several times a year&mdash;sometimes only in small amendments but cumulatively representing major policy and administrative changes to various schemes. It may be that the only remedy for the problem I have indicated is that the legislature should revert to amendments of primary legislation by individual bills.

In the predictable game of bluff, government in its rhetoric will hold the Senate responsible for an outcome vastly more detrimental to all beneficiaries than the proposed Senate amendments might have been beneficial to some. Again, a possible solution is to divide the bill into two or more self-contained bills, making it clear in the message to the House of Representatives that the Senate has given a third reading to one of the bills and postponed the third reading of the other, perhaps referring its provisions to a committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, a House of Representatives bill may contain an assortment of mismatching amendments to one Act, or too diverse a collection of amendments to several Acts. To some of these, agreement or rejection may be easy, while to others overhasty acceptance or rejection may be irresponsible. Like the bill itself, Senate opposition to clauses, or amendments to strike out provisions, can amount to a reversed Hobson's choice. Often, the Senate would be agreeable to passing, say, half of the bill, and seeking time to consider the other half but without delaying enactment of the first half. Again this could be graphically signalled to the House of Representatives by dividing the bill in two, agreeing to one bill, deferring consideration of the other, returning the divided bill by message to the House, thereby placing the onus on it to agree the new bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most dramatic recent example of this political Hobson's choice involved the 1993 budget legislation. An omnibus Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, proposed nine sets of major amendments to seven tax-related acts encapsulating the fiscal heart of the budget statement. Tax cuts were mixed with various tax rises. More than one latter-day Thomas Hobson in government demanded "that or none". The constitutional validity of the bill was challenged by independent legal opinions which concluded that the bill simultaneously <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">imposed tax</EMPHASIS>, dealt with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">more than one subject of tax</EMPHASIS> and dealt with matters <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">other than the imposition of tax</EMPHASIS>, in contravention of section 55 of the Constitution. Eventually the bill was withdrawn and redrafted by the government, ultimately in the form of <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">eleven</EMPHASIS> bills. In any event, attempts were made in the Senate, as a matter of principle, to divide some of these bills in order to place distinct subjects of taxation in separate bills (see appendix 2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar problems may arise in the future. The Minister of Finance, Mr Beazley, MP, (ALP)  has been reported as suggesting that "the political tactic of presenting the [1995] Budget as an interlocked package [will] help the Government put pressure on the Senate to agree to its fiscal plans". It was proposed, he said, to use a deficit reduction structure `very cleverly and very highly focused" to produce such pressure (Financial Review, 6 February 1995, p 5). Indeed, when in 1993, the omnibus taxation bill was recast by the government into eleven separate bills, one was described, drafted, and enacted as <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">a test bill</EMPHASIS> (the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2) 1993). It contains a mixture of provisions similar to those considered by the Senate, its legal committee and independent lawyers as possibly breaching section 55 of the Constitution. That the 1993 test bill was never tested may embolden the government in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividing a bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dividing a bill is one Senate procedure specifically designed to deal with this and other examples of Hobson's choice in legislation&mdash;a way to reshuffle the horses at the stable door by dividing the bill into its constituent parts in the form of, say two self-contained bills and then making it clear that no. 1 is agreed to but no. 2, being unpalatable, is not. Agreement to the provisions of the no. 2 bill can be postponed while it is examined by a committee prior to being agreed to, amended or rejected. Such a process can be used without jeopardising the major structure of the original bill which, in the form of the no. 1 bill, will have been agreed to by the Senate and returned to the House of Representatives for its agreement. Such a new bill, having as part of the original bill received its first, second and third reading in the House, does not need to repeat that process&mdash;the division of the original into several bills is merely an amendment to which the House can simply agree, thereby enacting the no. 1 bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before explaining further, a word of caution&mdash;this is not a procedure for the merely results-driven politician, the architect of great reforms, impatient with democracy and its inevitable tedium of mere process. It is a procedure, therefore it is all process&mdash;the reductive process of identifying the bare essentials of political disagreement rather than exaggerating them. Governments use rhetoric and exaggerate. Senates are at least more inclined to use process and reduce. Public opinion should be aware of the difference and its consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Second reading amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In using the procedure, a first option maybe to move, by notice, leave or suspension of standing orders, or as an amendment to the bill's second reading "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">that the minister withdraw the bill and redraft it</EMPHASIS>" in a specified form (for example, "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">as two separate bills, one dealing with X, the other dealing with Y </EMPHASIS>"); or move "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">that the bill be returned to the House of Representatives with a message requesting that the bill be redrafted by being divided into a bill for X and a bill for Y </EMPHASIS>". This was the course adopted in 1975 on the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill whose length and complexity made it very difficult for the Senate drafter to divide into several coherent bills. A limitation of this approach, however, is that the bill does not reach the stage at which the Senate can demonstrate its agreement to those agreeable portions of it. Thus, it does not reach the third reading stage in the Senate before being returned to the House of Representatives and the Senate's action is, therefore, easily confused with rejection or obstruction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Contingent notice for an instruction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another option is to divide the bill in the Senate. An <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">instruction</EMPHASIS> may be given to a committee of the whole to divide a bill into two or more bills (SO 150(1)). (Several bills can also be consolidated into one.) Normally a notice of motion of the proposed instruction must be given and that motion may be moved immediately after the second reading of the bill (SO 115(2)(b)). A motion for an instruction may also be moved by leave.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice a contingent notice of motion is given&mdash;"<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">that (contingent on the AB Bill being read a second time in the same or substantially the same form as it was read a first time) I shall move that it be an instruction to the committee of the whole on the bill that the committee (a) divide the bill so as to incorporate into two (three, four) bills the provisions relating to A and the provisions relating to B (and the provisions relating to C etc); and (b) report each of the bills separately."</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">the contingent event</EMPHASIS> occurs (ie as soon as the second reading is agreed to) the motion for the instruction may be moved (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"that it be an instruction to the committee of the whole  . . . that the committee divide the bill etc</EMPHASIS>"). This motion may be debated with up to 30 minutes for each speaker and no overall time limit; being a procedural rather than a substantive motion, the mover has no right of reply (Ruling of President Gould, 1 October 1909).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividing complex bills</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some House of Commons precedents (although not binding on the Senate) hold that an instruction is in order only if the relevant bill "is drafted in two or more distinct parts, or otherwise lends itself to such division into parts", (May, 21st ed., p 483). Odgers notes that "[l]ong and complex bills do not lend themselves easily to division" (6th ed., p 461). (This may justify returning the bill to the House of Representatives seeking (in effect from the government) its redrafting as two or more bills: see the Report of the Ninth Conference of Presiding Officers and Clerks, Parliamentary Paper No. 223/1978, p 215).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Usually a bill which amends other Acts can, with a little time and careful redrafting, be reduced to two or more bills incorporating each of the constituent parts of the original bill. A bill which does not amend other Acts may occasionally be more difficult to divide as numerous common provisions may need to be duplicated in the amendment creating the two bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In either case, further amendments must be relevant to the bill in question. The Senate adopts generous rules of relevance to facilitate debate and amendment. But if relevance is in serious doubt, a motion may be moved for an instruction to the committee of the whole <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">to consider</EMPHASIS> an amendment not relevant to the bill but relevant to an Act to be amended by the bill. Where such a problem is anticipated the original notice and motion for an instruction may contain the requirement <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">both</EMPHASIS> to divide the bill <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">and</EMPHASIS> consider certain amendments. If the bill in question is not one amending other Acts, an irrelevant amendment may be moved only after the committee has been empowered to consider it by a motion suspending standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to divide a bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, if the motion for an instruction is agreed to, the committee of the whole is under an order to carry it out, ie to divide the bill. The actual division requires a further motion, in committee of the whole, to bring about the drafting needed to physically create two (or more) bills from one, by a series of amendments. If agreed, a subcommittee of the committee of the whole could be appointed to draw up the amendments forming the two bills, if this was politically acceptable to the chamber (Odgers 6th ed., p 466). Usually though, the Senator moving for the instruction has had the amendments drawn up. Once divided, the committee can agree to further, substantive amendments (or requests) to either or both bills, or report progress on one bill and resume consideration of the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate has never actually agreed to an instruction to divide a bill though numerous motions have been made to achieve the same end. For example, on 4 December 1991 (but using suspension of standing orders rather than an instruction) Senator Parer (Lib) moved to divide the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 into two bills, one relating to political broadcasts, the other relating to political disclosures. His purpose was to separate provisions banning certain political advertising (which he opposed) from provisions requiring disclosure of political funding (which he supported). The attempted division was, therefore, a direct challenge to the Hobson's choice built into the bill&mdash;"the combination of both proposals or none". Senator Parer's motion provided that the first bill consist of the enacting words and certain Parts and clauses of the original bill; that the second bill consist of a certain Part of the original bill; that the first bill be amended to have an appropriate title and renumbered clauses; that the second bill be amended to insert clauses etc; that the two bills be printed and be considered separately on the next day. (The full text of the motion is set out for reference in appendix 1.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another example involved the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993, one of the eleven bills into which the single Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 referred to above was eventually divided <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">by the government</EMPHASIS> after its constitutionality was challenged. On 20 October 1993, Senator Hill (Lib) moved "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">that the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments to the bill </EMPHASIS>", namely that it be divided into four bills, one relating to fringe benefits tax, two relating to income tax rates and one relating to medicare levy. His purpose was to enable clear discrete voting choices on separate, constitutionally valid, bills rather than Hobson's choice on a single, composite, possibly unconstitutional bill. (Even as one of eleven extrapolated bills, the (No. 1) Bill was still a composite of at least four measures.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividing a tax bill by a request</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Hill's motion requested the House of Representatives to divide the bill so that the first bill consist of the enacting words and certain Parts of the original bill; and the second bill consist of a certain Division of the original bill; the third bill consist of a certain Division and Part of the original bill; the fourth bill consist of a certain Part of the original bill; and that each new bill have words of enactment, commencement clauses etc. This proposal was debated in committee of the whole with all the advantages of such a forum&mdash;up to fifteen minutes per speaker on as many occasions as necessary while debate continued. (The full text of the motion is set out for reference in appendix 2.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are the only requests for amendments dividing a bill ever considered by the Senate in committee of the whole. Senator Hill moved this motion in the form of a <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">request to the House of Representatives</EMPHASIS> to divide the bill because, by virtue of section 53 of the Constitution, the Senate has no constitutional power to amend a bill imposing tax or a bill appropriating money for the ordinary annual services of the government. It can merely <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">request</EMPHASIS> the House of Representatives to amend such bills. It was considered that as the composite tax bill imposed a tax, it was unamendable because of section  53, and could be the subject only of requests for amendments <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">even though</EMPHASIS> the amendments sought only to divide the bill into constituent parts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The normal instruction procedure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary then, where time permits, the normal procedure to divide a bill is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">.give a contingent notice of motion that it be an instruction to the committee of the whole to divide the bill;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.this is followed, after the second reading of the bill, by a motion moving such an instruction;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.in the committee of the whole a series of amendments is moved to amend the bill, literally to create two or more bills from it;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.other substantive amendments (or requests) can be moved and progress on one bill reported while the other continues in committee;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the committee reports that the bill is amended by being divided into a first bill and a second bill etc;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the motion to adopt the report of the committee of the whole may provide that the third reading of the second or objectionable bill be postponed;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the first bill may then be given a third reading by the Senate;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the message to the House of Representatives recounts this sequence of events, setting out the amendments made to create the two bills;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the House may agree to these amendments, in effect enacting the new bill to which the Senate has already agreed;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the provisions of the second bill remain under consideration in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Expedited procedures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More often than not, time, tactics, or circumstances render this instruction procedure inappropriate and more expeditious avenues are needed to divide a bill. From the Senate's point of view, the political goals are the same: to divide Hobson's bill into two or more bills to expedite passage; to make voting options clear and unencumbered; and to lay the furphy of Senate obstruction by placing uncontentious measures in one bill, giving it a third reading and returning it to the House of Representatives for agreement, while placing more controversial measures in another bill for further consideration. On such further consideration, that "new" bill could be agreed to or amended and returned to the House, or rejected, laid aside, and/or replaced by an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">entirely</EMPHASIS> new bill (as long as such a new bill <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">can</EMPHASIS> be introduced in the Senate).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expedited procedures invariably involve suspensions of standing orders either to move an instruction without notice or to go further and actually divide the bill in the Senate and have the new bills printed before their separate consideration in committee of the whole (as Senator Parer sought to do).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to divide without instructions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following examples illustrate the use of expedited procedures. On 8 September 1981, Senator Harradine gave a contingent notice for an instruction to the committee of the whole to divide the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1A to 9A) 1981 to incorporate certain measures in a separate bill. He later withdrew this notice and the Senate requested the House to make numerous amendments to the bill. However, on 23 September 1981 the Senator gave another notice that, contingent upon the receipt of a message from the House indicating that it had <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">not</EMPHASIS> made those amendments, he would move that it be an instruction to the committee of the whole to divide the bill to incorporate separate measures in a separate bill as proposed in his previous contingent notice. (The requests were not made and Senator Harradine choose not to use his contingent notice: see Odgers, 6th ed., p 467.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 27 October 1982, after the second reading of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982, Senator Grimes (ALP) moved that so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent him moving that it be an instruction to the committee of the whole to divide the bill to incorporate certain clauses and Parts in a separate bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, as noted above, on 2 December 1991, Senator Parer gave a notice of motion that, contingent on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991 being read a second time, he would move to suspend standing orders to propose the division of the bill. He moved the motion on 4 December 1991 (see appendix 1) dividing the bill. In addition, however, his motion provided that the "new" bills be considered separately, be taken as each having been read a second time (the second reading of the original bill had been agreed to) and be printed as separate bills for consideration in committee of the whole on the next day. When this motion was negatived, Senator Parer used the more usual contingent notice, given on 2 December 1991, to move that it be an instruction to the committee of the whole to divide the bill. The rationale was that the Senate having rejected <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">his</EMPHASIS> proposed division of the bill would have a second chance to propose its own division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly on 9 December 1994, Senator Harradine (Ind) moved to suspend standing orders to enable him to move a motion for an instruction to the committee of the whole to divide the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 to incorporate in a separate bill a schedule dealing with parliamentarians' remuneration. He thought this schedule should not have been intermixed with this bill. The original bill, without the schedule, dealt with uncontentious coal industry reforms which he wished to support while postponing the third reading of his proposed "new" bill dealing with remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Odgers and Whyte v Hobson</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the 1978 Presiding Officers' Conference, Odgers stressed that "dividing a bill is nothing more than amending it" but he characterised the procedure as an "essential" power of "profound" importance to a house of review, the antidote to unfair practices like tacking, combining unrelated matters, mixing popular and unpopular measures&mdash;in effect the answer to Hobson's choice (p 213, 214 and 216). The Tasmanian and South Australian Parliaments have divided bills and agreed to the resulting new bills. The President of the South Australian Legislative Council, AM Whyte, told the 1978 Conference that "the right of the House to split bills where it sees unrelated matters, some of which can be passed without great consideration, and a matter which needs detailed debate and detailed research, is most necessary" (p.233) .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate (in spite of the efforts of some tactically minded senators), while recognising the procedural possibilities of dividing bills, has not yet agreed to divide a bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will impose a total of an additional $13.9 billion in taxes on Australians next financial year. Unlucky 13 seems to have been the government's number in this year's budget. There will be no second round One Nation tax cuts. The l-a-w tax cuts are no more&mdash;it seems there is one law for average Australians and another law for the Keating government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy, which is a tax, will increase again despite the government's assurances that this would never need to happen. The tax office is to crackdown on certain labour relationships, which it does not like because they have revenue implications, even though those arrangements have been entered into by Australians as a result of this government's previous taxation policies. Company tax will increase by three per cent to 36 per cent. This is a 10 per cent increase in tax for Australian businesses, a vast number of which are still struggling to recover from the recession we had to have and the recession that this government actually manipulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New sales taxes will be introduced for a large range of building materials. This will have serious implications for an important sector of the economy. A 30 per cent increase in sales tax will be applied to non-luxury motor vehicles. This is a cynical act that exposes the illegitimacy of the government's actions taken in 1992 to bring the rate down to 16 per cent. In fact, there are 13 pages of revenue measure changes in the budget which will add to the previously announced measures that increase all sales tax rates by one per cent and bring forward corporate tax payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the expenditure side the government has triumphed its tight fiscal outcome. That outcome will see government outlays rise next year by $1.3 billion, if you include asset sales, which is not fair, or by $6.3 billion if you excluded them. This is the most difficult point for the ordinary person to appreciate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Receipts from sales of physical assets are recorded as offsets within outlays to assist the measurement of the net stock of capital assets in the economy. Thus the proceeds from the sale of the assets serve to reduce outlays, which is a measure of the government's economic activity. So this year, after raising taxes by an historical level and increasing outlays, the government has still been forced to turn to asset sales to balance the books. After taking more and more money from the pockets of Australians, this government has found it necessary to sell the nation's assets just to make the books balance. What a sale!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next financial year, the government will sell in excess of $5 billion of the country's assets. Will these sales be used to invest in the infrastructures of Australia? Will the revenue from these sales be used to reduce the nation's bankcard debt? No. This government is an expenditure addict. It just cannot help spending. As soon as money falls into its hands, it has to spend it. Money burns holes in this government's pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the result of this profligate spending can be seen in the monthly bankcard bill, our balance of payments and the current account deficit. We have to pay back not a couple of million dollars per month or a couple of hundred million dollars per month but over $2 billion per month. Unbelievably, this government argues that this is a good result. A good result! One can only imagine what a bad result might mean. It reminds me of the Black Knight in Monty Python's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In search of the Holy Grail</EMPHASIS>. With both arms and both legs cut off, the knight calls out to his slayer, `It's just a flesh wound.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, this is no joke. Our country is haemorrhaging and the government thinks it is a good result. Heaven help the nation if the USA heads into recession and our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures should decline. This government has wilfully ignored our trading plight. No truckload of statistics will change the undeniable fact that our country must act to support business, not destroy it. But what could we expect from a Prime Minister who could not even hold down a basic salesman's job and a government whose ministers have no basic experience in operating even the most simple businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ever improve this trading disaster, the nation must make some hard decisions about where we are going and how we are going to get there. These decisions must be made soon, as the rest of the world, particularly our major trading partners, made these decisions long ago. As long as we hide our heads in the sand, lock ourselves in the bedroom and act with pique and disdain for the world around us, the living standards of all Australians will continue to fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our labour regulation laws must be reviewed and employees freed from the senseless regulation of their lives by the dead hand of bureaucracy, subject to the provision of a reasonable and genuine safety net. We must reduce our fiscal cancer of high government expenditure. Whether government expenditure is high relative to other nations or not, it continues to limit the potential of this country to grow at a sustainable rate to allow for employment growth and low inflation. At present, as soon as our growth rate exceeds three per cent, the fear of inflation pushes up our interest rates and chokes our industry. At the same time, without growth of around four per cent, our unemployment queues lengthen and social misery increases. How, in a country so rich in resources and so rich in innovation and enterprise, can this situation be allowed to occur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the government of Australia took positive steps to give back the nation to its people. It is only the people of Australia who can care for the environment, produce wealth and jobs and look after those who are disadvantaged or incapacitated in any way; it is only the people of Australia who can establish a future for generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this budget bring for the Australian people? It brings higher taxes, lower economic growth, more debt, the sale of the country's assets and more pain for the productive and employing small businesses of this country. This is a budget that only a 13-year-old tired government could have produced. This budget, like the ministers and government backbenchers who will hawk it to the Australian public, is full of rhetoric and hollow, empty promises. Let no-one be in doubt that this budget is a cynical and complacent exercise. While the coalition will not oppose these appropriation bills, let no-one be in any doubt that the coalition believes this is a budget that has failed Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few comments on the appropriation bills, with particular reference to Antarctica. I will refer to comments I made the other night at an estimates committee hearing. My colleague Senator Gibson has just talked about taxation and the inappropriate way in which the government has tackled the budget. I must say that the Antarctic division has been pruned rather severely in the last two years. I have been concerned about the effect that will have on research projects and the day-to-day running of the division. It has also forced the division into a situation where it has reduced its two ship option to one ship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been concerned for quite some time about the effect that might have on the safety of our expeditioners and researchers in Antarctica. I found out at the estimates committee hearing that the budget this year will be cut by almost $1 million. Although it will not have an immediate effect, the director informed me that it will have an effect further down the track. As I said, I have had a more than passing interest in the one ship option and the contracts regarding shipping and the building of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS> a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the estimates committee hearings, I again raised the question of the charter costs of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Icebird</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS>. This year in the budget I noticed the division was expecting another $2.5 million allocation for shipping. After having been told last year that it was going to be a one ship operation and that it would employ another ship every three years, lo and behold, less than 12 months later, the division is looking at chartering the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Icebird</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the name has been changed to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Polarbird</EMPHASIS>. Less than 12 months later the division has changed its mind again. I do not blame the director for this. It is because of the severe cutbacks caused by the government. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has gone again now. As I said, I am concerned about the result of this bill in relation to safety in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major things I wanted to do was find out the cost of chartering the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Icebird</EMPHASIS> last year and how much it has cost in the past. Every time we talk about charter rates the minister throws up his hands and says, `I'm sorry.' In the estimates committee hearing, the director said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>divulge the charter cost&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My recollection is that there is a confidentiality stamp across the whole contract.</PARA>
<PARA>I raised with them the fact that on a previous occasion when trying to find out the confidentiality of Mr Hill's contract with the ABC the estimates committee was of the opinion that the documents had to be forwarded. In this particular case, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It took a particular decision that is not the case in relation to the confidentiality clauses in these contracts.</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the contract of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Icebird</EMPHASIS>. I wanted to find out the difference between the charter rate offered last year and what it was going to cost the taxpayers this year. Unfortunately, that information was refused once again. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there is a very significant risk that the Commonwealth would be in breach of contract if in fact the information that has been sought was disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA>I noticed during the week in an AAP release in Melbourne that a report was tabled in the parliament by the Victorian Auditor-General. He, too, sounded his concerns about the confidentiality of some of the executive officer contracts. He said that he was initially refused access to the required documents on the grounds that the contracts were confidential between the employee and employer. They are not quite the same as a contract between a government department and a shipping company, but the principles of commercial-in-confidence and making these things available still apply. So the Auditor-General in Victoria has raised the same doubts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report of the environment, sport and territories estimates committee, my colleagues and I made some general comments. I will quote from a couple of areas in the report to senators. In 2.1 of the report, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a request by Senator Calvert for information contained in the contract for the charter of the supply ship, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Icebird</EMPHASIS> was refused on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also pointed out that similar situations had arisen at additional estimates on 29 November 1994 when the ABC refused to provide details on the contract of the outgoing director, David Hill. The important part is, as the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that confusion still appears to exist as to the duty of government agencies and bodies to provide information to Parliamentary committees. As this Committee stated in its report of December 1994, the over-riding principle was stated clearly in the report from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABC Employment Contracts</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> and their Confidentiality</EMPHASIS> (December 1986).</PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "authorities must be prepared to account to Estimates Committees for all aspects of their financial management and administration, even when the information sought may be regarded as private or commercially confidential."</PARA>
<PARA>Further in the general comments of the committee, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, it is something for the committee to determine, not the witness.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was not for the minister, nor was it for Mr Moncur, the director of the Antarctic division, to say that they could refuse information that I had requested; it was up to the committee to decide whether I should receive that information. The estimates committee report to the Senate also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A government department or statutory authority has no power to unilaterally withhold information simply because in its own opinion the information should be confidential.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Committee noted in its December 1994 report that, under the revised Standing Orders which came into effect on 10 October 1994, Legislation Committees when considering Estimates, (unlike the former estimates committees)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is where I think the minister may have got his wires crossed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had a formal power to call for persons and documents, although (like the former Estimates Committee) they have no power to take evidence in private.</PARA>
<PARA>At the request of Senator Kernot of the Australian Democrats, the first Senate privileges report highlighted the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on several recent occasions the government has failed to comply with orders and requests of the Senate.  </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee of Privileges came to the conclusion that it is for the relevant house to take action under its contempt powers as it considers appropriate in the circumstances. In other words it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not accept the concept that jurisdiction in respect of the determination of claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity against a house of Parliament or its committees should be conferred on the courts;</PARA>
<PARA>That is rather technical. The second report in March 1995 is more explicit. It dealt with the Casselden Place matter. Page 3&mdash;and these are the very important words when the issue of commercial-in-confidence is raised&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, authorities must be prepared to account to Estimates Committees for all aspects of their financial management and administration, even when the information sought may be regarded as private or commercially confidential. This aspect of statutory authority accountability should be made clear at the time an authority enters into negotiations for any type of contract and should be made clear in the terms of contracts entered into.</PARA>
<PARA>The report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee reaffirms the comments made in its 49th Report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which I referred to just a moment ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that any claims of executive privilege or public interest immunity are ultimately for a House of Parliament to determine . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Then the report goes on to make some other comments. In other words, twice now the Senate Committee of Privileges has put down its view on commercial-in-confidence. From memory, during the last three or four estimates committee hearings I have been refused under the guise of commercial-in-confidence information that I think is important for the parliament to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe taxpayers' interests have to be served. I do not believe contracts have been let and moneys wasted intentionally, but I think I should have had the opportunity to highlight that generous offers were made last year by, in this particular case, the company that owned the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Icebird</EMPHASIS>. By not accepting the offer that was made last year and then having, as a result of government bungling on the budget, to turn around and charter this vessel this year, we might have missed out on quite considerable savings for the taxpayers of Australia. Because this commercial-in-confidence clause has been used, I have been unable to find out about these matters and report them to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I stand here today commenting on this is to bring to the Senate's attention again&mdash;I am sure this will be discussed when the report on the estimates comes forward&mdash;that ministers of the government have been using this commercial-in-confidence power to hide the real story. I believe senators have the right to find out at estimates committees what is happening with taxpayers' dollars. After all is said and done, that is what estimates committees are about: inquiring into where money is being spent, where it is going, what is being wasted and what is being saved. In this case, if these figures had been made available I think I would have been able to show that, because of government budget restrictions and alterations in shipping procedures over the last couple of years, not only have a lot of the government research programs in the Antarctica been put at risk but also lives of our expeditioners may have been put at risk at one stage or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will leave it at that, because I know other speakers are waiting, except to say that when we are talking about the appropriations I think it is also very important to talk about what happens in estimates committees and the way some ministers use different devices to keep cost overruns and the like from members of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us the appropriation bills. It is most appropriate that we now focus on the budget after enduring all this week the obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with turning this country into a republic. We can now get back to what really is important to ordinary Australians&mdash;that is, the state of the economy, taxation and unemployment. As most of you know, only one per cent of Australians think the republic is important; the majority think that what really matters, and what is really concerning this country, is the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget that this government has presented, and that we are debating, is a classic financial statement from the Labor Party. It is a tax and spend budget. We have in this budget the most extraordinary increases in taxation which have not yet sunk into the psyche of the Australian people as they try to get rid of the cloud put upon them by Mr Keating and his republic. But the tax effect of this budget will sink into the Australian psyche and will destroy this government at the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a 13.9 per cent increase in personal income tax in this budget; a 15.4 per cent increase in company tax, which ends up being paid by consumers and taxpayers; and a 13.4 per cent increase in sales tax, which is paid at the end of the day by ordinary Australians. Total revenue to the government is increasing 12.8 per cent. That total is up nearly $14 billion, which works out at $700 for every man, woman and child in this country. That is the effect of a Labor government&mdash;an extra $700 per annum for every one of us, including my two young sons who will effectively be paying another $700 a year to this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only tax but also spending is up. This government is absolutely incapable of controlling its spending. Despite all the evidence that what is required is a public sector contribution to savings, we have more government spending. Outlays excluding asset sales are up 5.4 per cent in this budget, which is about $6 1/2 billion of extra government spending. As a result, the public debt interest bill is up nearly $2 billion a year to over $10 billion per annum just on interest on the bankcard which this government has subjected us to. As my colleague Senator Vanstone pointed out in question time, we are now spending nearly as much on interest on debts racked up by this government as we spend on defending the country&mdash;an absurd situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total Commonwealth debt is now over $100 billion, a figure which escapes the scope of thinking of most Australians. It is an unthinkable amount of money. It has risen $13.3 billion in the last 12 months following a similar rise in the previous year. You keep racking up the debt on the bankcard and future generations of Australians are going to have to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all that, we still have an underlying budget deficit revealed in the budget documents of $8.2 billion, which will just keep getting added to the debt. The government's smoke and mirrors trick was to flog off the silver through the asset sales of an alleged $5.3 billion, which we will believe when we see it. That is all going to recurrent expenditure, which is the equivalent of selling the backyard so you can pay for your friends to come over and have a barbecue with you. That is what this government is doing. There is absolutely no attempt to fix the underlying structural deficit in this country. When all the assets are gone, Australians will start to wonder what this government will do. There will still be the problem of a major structural deficit in the budget. The proceeds of asset sales should be going directly to reducing the massive debt which this government has been building up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that vein, the government should, and a coalition government will, take its lead from the South Australian state government which, among others, has made it quite clear in its budget process that asset sales will go to reduce debt. So you keep asset sales out of the budget process and delineate quite clearly recurrent income and expenditure so that you get a true picture of the state of the nation's finances. The proceeds of asset sales in South Australia are all going to reduce the debt built up by its previous state Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian senator I should and will point out the very perverse effects of this budget on South Australia. It is a direct attack on the problems in South Australia and worsens the problems in South Australia. In particular I point to the one-third increase in sales tax on cars from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. Yet another per cent will be added on 1 July to take it to 22 per cent, which will add $1,000 to the price of an average Holden or Falcon. This really does expose the unbelievably deep cynicism of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government dropped this sales tax down to 15 per cent in the lead-up to the 1993 election only because the GST of 15 per cent that we were proposing would result in cheaper motor vehicles. This panicked the government into making a sudden and electioneering drop in the sales tax rate to match our 15 per cent. Of course, at that time the government dressed it up as a permanent reduction. The word `permanent' was used by the Prime Minister. He talked about how this would help the environment by helping Australians buy more fuel efficient vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, now that the election is comfortably out of the way, we learn what the word `permanent' means to Prime Minister Keating&mdash;it means absolutely nothing. This is yet another broken promise and the tax has been increased. It reinforces the point that we simply cannot believe anything this government says, and that is what will bring about this government's downfall at the next election. It used up all the political capital it had in achieving victory at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision in relation to sales tax on cars particularly hurts South Australia, which most honourable senators know is much more dependent on the car industry than any other state. Two out of the four manufacturers and many of the component makers for the four manufacturers are based in South Australia. Thousands of South Australians are totally dependent on the car industry for their livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that vein, it is an utterly stupid decision. It will very badly affect South Australia, which is still suffering the consequences of years of Labor administration at state and federal level. South Australia, as this Senate knows, has a fragile economy. It has the lowest mainland growth after all those years of Labor rule and it still has a very high unemployment rate. Despite the slight drop recently, 9.7 per cent of South Australians are unemployed. That is over a full percentage point above the national rate, yet this decision will grossly affect the situation in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade unions&mdash;the government's own pals and union mates&mdash;recognise the stupidity of this decision. Paul Noack, the South Australian secretary of the vehicle division of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, has written to all of us asking us to oppose the government's tax. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any harm this tax causes to Australia's car industry will produce a loss to our balance of trade, to employment levels, to wage tax revenue and to our manufacturing base. This potential loss far outweighs increased tax revenue on locally produced cars whose sales are seriously threatened by imports.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Noack goes on to ask us to oppose this tax. I am happy to declare here and now that my colleagues and I will vote against this stupid increase in the tax. We will also vote against the increases in the company tax, the sales tax on building materials and the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really is a king hit on South Australia. It follows the damage done by this government to South Australia in the 1993 budget when it brought in the increases in wine tax. If there are two industries that matter to South Australia they are the wine industry and the car industry. This government in the last two years has king-hit both those industries in the most fragile state economy on the mainland. The government clearly has absolutely no sensitivity to the regional problems in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really highlights one of the major problems with current Labor Party economic policy. It has just one macro-economic policy for six different state economies. There are six economies in this country, despite the government's centralist pretensions. One only has to look at the different growth rates, the different unemployment rates and the different activity rates in the six states to know that that is a fact of life. Government policy is deliberately designed now to slow down the Australian economy. It is deliberately trying to slow down growth and it is doing that by maintaining high real interest rates and high taxation, which I have just outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High growth may well be a problem in Queensland and Western Australia, but I can tell you that South Australians wish they had that problem. It is hardly a problem in South Australia where, as I said, after so many years of an inept Labor government we have the lowest growth rate on the mainland. What South Australia needs is incentives to growth&mdash;not crushing policies out of a centralised approach in Canberra dealing with the non-existent national economy. The answer is a much more responsible macro-economic policy which is much more sensitive to the fact that we have six economies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope a coalition government will introduce the equivalent of New Zealand's Fiscal Responsibility Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that today John Prescott, the head of our biggest and most successful company, has highlighted the real problems in this area. He said that there is clear evidence of reform fatigue in this government. As he said, the cost disadvantages that many companies in this country are facing are greatest on the waterfront and in rail freight for which the Labor government has direct responsibility. He said that government and port authority charges for containers at our most competitive port, Fremantle, were 2 1/2 times those applying in Singapore. Container charges in Melbourne were 40 per cent higher than that. Charges to get a car into Melbourne were quoted at $73.92 in 1992, the highest in Australia, whereas to get a car into Seattle cost $10.48&mdash;one-seventh of the cost of Melbourne&mdash;and to get a car into Osaka cost $13.91. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that your Labor colleague Premier Carr has drawn attention to the idiocy of your unfair dismissal laws, which put the onus totally on the employer and are an anti-employment policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to record my deep regret at the government's failure in this budget to do anything about a matter which I and many of my colleagues have spoken about; that is, the discrimination this government is maintaining against mothers of young children who have sacrificed an income to care for their children at home. Despite all the evidence of the discrimination which we have brought to the parliament's attention, despite the community activity on this subject and despite the Cass report which resulted from the government's very own National Council for the International Year of the Family and which highlighted the discriminatory operation of government policy, the government has done absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to believe press reports, there was considerable anxiety and division within the government on this issue. But, clearly, there was a stalemate and a failure to do anything. So the discrimination continues to exist. It exists in the fact that a mother of two in the paid work force who places her children in child care will receive twice as much from the government as a mother of two young children caring for them at home. That is the bald fact. They receive twice as much. There is no income test for the mother in the paid work force with her children in child care who receives money under the child-care cash rebate. She can earn a million dollars a year and she will still receive support from the government. However, there is a quite severe income test on what was the home child-care allowance which has now been converted to the parenting allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted that the income test has been eased and the mother at home can now earn $30 a week. I am delighted to see that that threshold has been increased. But I note that what is now called the parenting allowance is reduced by 50c for every extra dollar you earn in the range $30 to $70 and then by 70c for every dollar above $70 a week. The income test remains in comparison to the non-existent income test under the CCR quite prohibitive and quite severe. The discrimination and bias remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As John Howard made quite clear in his magnificent speech this week on the role of government, the point is that the issue is choice. The government should not arbitrarily and unfairly interfere with the choice which young mothers make about their work and child-care arrangements. Current policy directly interferes in that choice and directs it in one direction. There is not free choice for young mothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that expenditure on this child-care cash rebate, which has been subject to much criticism within the government, is increasing by 31 per cent in this forthcoming year to $118 million, out of a total of $1,107 million on child care. It is the worst form of middle-class welfare. We advocated at the time it was brought in that it should be means tested, subject to an income test and subject to the same test applying to the family payments system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to the budget increase in the tobacco excise, which is clearly nothing more than revenue raising by the government. It is predicted to raise an extra $70 million in 1995-96. Most of this is taken out of the pockets of what has been described this week as that class of Australians called battlers. Many of the three million Australians who regularly smoke are battlers. I have never smoked in my life and I am not here to defend the act of smoking, but these Australians, many of whom are on very low incomes and whose one joy in life is smoking, are now being hit yet again by this latest government impost. It is these battlers who will pay this extra tax, and they are saying, quite rightly, `Enough is enough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to trace what has happened on the tobacco tax. The government laid out a plan for tobacco excise increases in 1993 with six monthly increases of five per cent finalising in a five per cent increase in August of this year. The government in the budget brought that five per cent increase due in August 1995 forward to budget night, doubled it to 10 per cent and said to all three million Australians who smoke, `Tough luck,' catching all the smokers and the tobacco companies completely unaware in a most capricious, unfair and unjustifiable manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a 35 per cent increase in the tobacco excise since August 1993. It is by far the most heavily taxed consumer product in Australia. The budget night increase is completely unwarranted and unacceptable. The government should stick to the program of budget increases that it announced in 1993. The next and final increase should be five per cent in August 1995 and not the 10 per cent that occurred on budget night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this budget is a complete failure. It fails to deal with our major economic problems, it has ignored them completely. It is a political document to get the government through the election. It fails to deal with the massive foreign debt of $160,000 we have incurred under this government. It fails to deal with the problem of the current account deficit, budgeted to be again $27,000 million in this financial year. It fails to deal with this country's very low savings ratio. It fails to deal with the fact that we still have 800,000 Australians without a job. It fails to deal with what are still among the highest real interest rates in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate failure is this government's admission that it cannot allow the Australian economy to grow fast enough to reduce unemployment to acceptable levels. If it tries to grow at a speed which will allow unemployment to be reduced to acceptable levels, the wheels fall off the economy, the bus starts to rattle and we run off the road. That is the ultimate indictment of this government's economic policy. Instead of fiddling around with our constitution, the government should spend its final few months before it is turfed out of office trying to repair the damage that it has done over the last 12 years to the Australian economy. </PARA>

Although it takes a very long time to find, if we read through budget paper No. 1&mdash;quite a thick volume&mdash;and we go about nine-tenths of the way through, on page 7.3 we see that there is a table called `Table 2&mdash;Adjusted ABS budget deficit'. That tells us the true story&mdash;that, in fact, there is an $8.2 billion deficit in this budget. That is something that needs to be debunked. The people of Australia need to be advised at all times that this is not a surplus budget but, as ABS points out, an $8.2 billion deficit budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in a slip of the tongue acknowledged that the surplus was a psychological surplus.

We have now come to the end of the road where we can just borrow over and over again to fund all the pet projects of this government and then have the government trying to rebuy or repurchase an electoral mandate on every single occasion it goes to the polls. There is a limit to how much we can borrow; we have arrived at that limit. </PARA>

Let me say that yes, it does ease the lifestyle for the Prime Minister and all those who might be in the chamber or elsewhere whose life expectancy might not be very great. But I tell this house and the people of Australia that there is no compassion, no concern, when I know that my three young children will be responsible for paying off the debts which have been incurred by Mr Keating and his government over the past 12 to 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a shameful situation. I know that when my children have to face the burden of the extravagance of the Labor era, they will not be talking about it in terms of it being caring and compassionate. They will be talking about it in absolute anger, because their rightful inheritance has been sold off for electoral frauds perpetrated by Mr Keating. Well may Mr Keating talk about giving Australia some degree of independence and a republic to allow Australians to determine their own future: the simple fact is that my children will not be able to determine their own economic future because Mr Keating has already mortgaged it. </PARA>

If the international bailiff were to come along and say, `We want that $12,000 out of each Australian,' how would we repay that? Each of us would have to make significant and devastating sacrifices. That is for one reason alone: because of the extravagance of the Australian Labor Party.

This is the fourth occasion on which Qantas has been in the budget papers to be sold. This is the fourth attempt that Labor has had to try to sell Qantas. Of course, the Commonwealth Bank sale is in defiance of undertakings given by Labor.

One of her first undertakings was: `There will be no increase in the Medicare levy.' She was absolutely firm. Her credibility was to be determined on that undertaking.

It is worth noting, as Senator Minchin said, that the tax rate on cars was dropped just to match opposition policy for the last election. Now that that is over, the government has increased it and that is exactly what happened with company tax.

The list just goes on and on. If a company has to pay more by way of superannuation or fringe benefits tax, what does that mean? The price of the goods that they supply to Australians unfortunately has to go up.

For a Keating government that is so interested in calling us unrepresentative swill and for the Labor Party that used to have in its policy the abolition of this chamber, what better way of achieving that result than by neutering us and by withholding funds to ensure that we cannot undertake the work that we are required to undertake by the people of Australia. </PARA>

It has gone up to $14 billion&mdash;its highest ever proportion of gross domestic product, and double the percentage that existed when John Howard was the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total tax revenue level, from which these appropriations are being made, is now 24.2 per cent of gross domestic product. That is higher than in John Howard's last budget, despite dishonest claims to the contrary that are continually being made by the government. When it makes those claims, it sneakily refers to higher revenue in John Howard's day rather than higher taxes. The government carefully omits the fact that revenue was higher in John Howard's day because there were many more government bodies providing dividends to the government. They have now been sold off to pay for the extraordinary waste of this government. </PARA>

Of course, that is giving it the best gloss possible from the government's point of view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I particularly want to deal with sales tax because sales tax demonstrates the lie to its greatest degree. Sales tax is a consumption tax. It is the tax the Labor Party would not wear. The Labor Party attacked violently the whole concept of consumption tax during the last federal election campaign. Yet since that time there has been this massive increase in sales taxes&mdash;the greatest increase in sales tax revenue in Australia's history, lifting sales tax revenue to its highest proportion of gross domestic product ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the history of sales tax&mdash;this tax that the Labor government opposed violently and on which it is now relying more and more for its revenue. I think the government will be collecting something like $14 billion from this sneaky consumption tax which is on almost everything that most Australians pay for, even some foods. Sales tax, interestingly enough, and I suppose it is natural, was first introduced into Australia by a Labor government with effect from 1 August 1930. This tax the Labor Party violently opposes as a dreadful consumption tax was introduced by Labor, has been increased by Labor, has been used by Labor and has been the basis upon which Labor has mounted a deceptive and dishonest campaign against a reform of that consumption tax during the last election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a few countries maintain the operation of a wholesale sales tax along Labor's lines. Australia is the only developed country persevering with the operation of this tax&mdash;Labor's sales tax, as I said, introduced by Labor. Naturally you can trust Labor when it introduces a tax not to increase it&mdash;much! When it was first introduced it was 2.5 per cent. Only a year later the then Prime Minister increased it to six per cent. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally, the tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, sales tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has proved most unsatisfactory, but I recognise it is inevitable that we should not only continue to impose it but should increase the rate from 2.5 per cent to six per cent. That alone is sufficient to indicate the unfortunate financial position of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He was so right. It is exactly the same now. Here, once again, Australia is in what could politely be described as an `unfortunate financial position' as a result of this government's incompetence. How is the government solving it? By whacking up sales tax&mdash;Labor's own tax. What did Mr Chifley, Labor's icon, have to say when he tried to improve the sales tax system? This is back in the 1940s when he reduced the number of different scales of sales tax&mdash;it had been three. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recognised that considerable work is involved in the classification of goods into three separate groups and it is hoped that a substantial measure of relief will be afforded by the reduction in the number of rates of tax from three to two.</PARA>
<PARA>So what is Labor doing? I suppose Ben Chifley would be rolling in his grave because the current rates of sales tax are as follows: there is one lot at nil; there is one lot at 11 per cent; there is another lot at 16 per cent; there is another lot at 21 per cent; there is another lot at 24 per cent; there is another lot at 31 per cent; and another lot at 45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is Mr Chifley saying, `You mustn't have this big range of sales taxes' and what does this government do? Exactly the opposite, because this government believes in secretly ripping off the ordinary battlers of Australia by hitting them where they cannot see it, by putting taxes on things like toilet paper, soap, ice-cream and so on that they do not realise exist. As if that is not bad enough&mdash;this huge range of different categories of sales tax, which involves a whole lot of very convenient prosecutions for the government as the tax office keeps fining small businesses, in particular, for putting the wrong rate of sales tax on whatever it is they are selling&mdash;these rates are to go up from 1 July. </PARA>

All those sneaky, secret sales tax rises take place at the end of this month. Would you trust Labor with any tax? You certainly would not trust it with tax promises. What happens once the taxes are in? Up they go. These taxes are simply and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to a booklet called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Sales Tax Challenge</EMPHASIS>, put out by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and written by David Vos FCA.

<PARA>It concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much needs to be done to overhaul the wholesale sales tax. The Federal Government needs to show leadership and reconstruct the taxing base from scratch.</PARA>
<PARA>Before the government can do that, it has to tell the truth. It would not want to do that, would it? It keeps hiding its disgraceful record of sneaky tax rises.

<PARA>In other words, on top of the tax, they had the huge cost of  filling in the forms, collecting them and sending them in&mdash;a 25 per cent added cost burden to small businesses. They are the people with annual sales tax liabilities of less than $50,000. It is small business that this government is hitting hardest with this deceptive Labor sales tax&mdash;introduced by Labor, reinforced by Labor and increased by Labor. Now it is the fastest rising tax in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly no simplification here if compliance costs are 25 per cent for small business. It is a bit simpler for the tax man to operate&mdash;not for small business people, taxpayers, who have to foot the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other people affected by this tax are those in business. There is a huge input cost on business. As a study points out, more than half of the initial incidence of wholesale sales tax is on business inputs. In the end consumers have to pay, but businesses are trying to compete with overseas and are having to pay something like 49 per cent for initial sales tax costs. This burden is passed on to consumers by businesses. However, foreign companies&mdash;the companies that some of our companies are competing with&mdash;do not have that kind of burden. It is a disincentive to business. It is a disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has done absolutely nothing to stop that. In fact, it is like a carrion crow feeding off the people of Australia, the businesses of Australia, the battlers of Australia, the small businesses of Australia, the ordinary consumers of Australia, with this hidden, sneaky sales tax which the government pretended it opposed. It is Labor's consumption tax. As Senator Abetz said, it is the government's own secret GST. That is what it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add a few things to this debate on the appropriation bills. What I would mostly like to add relates to the non-appropriations by this government. I do not have the time to go into all of those non-appropriations in this year's budget and these bills, but I will go into one aspect: drought relief around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, there has been an increase in drought relief to northern New South Wales, parts of Queensland and parts of Victoria. I am glad that at last the government is accepting that drought has a big effect on the state of the Australian economy. When the Hawke government was first elected in 1983, it would never recognise that the reason the economy was down at the end of the Fraser government was the massive drought the eastern states had in 1982 and the drought that followed in Western Australia in 1983. It was a very big, hard, long drought to go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eastern states drought of last year was almost as bad. The government recognised that fact and through the drought relief, which I welcome, made available low interest loans, household support, et cetera. I, along with all my colleagues, said that that aid was nowhere near what was required. With the massive population in New South Wales, the bottom of Queensland and the top of Victoria, this government finally listened to their plight and did come up with a certain amount. It then followed up with some more aid in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to hear what Senator Gareth Evans, who represents the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this place, has to say when the balance of trade figures are not as good as expected. On half a dozen occasions in the last few weeks, he has blamed the drought for those figures. Everyone in the Labor government has always refused to acknowledge the drought at the end of the Fraser years. Former Senator Button was always comparing the situation of the economy but he would never answer an interjection of mine, `What about the drought of 1982?' Finally the government is admitting that drought does knock around the economy and Australia's export income. That is very interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government has recognised the eastern states, it has completely left the Western Australian drought affected areas of East Gascoyne and Murchison out in the cold. I did a big tour of those regions in around mid-March, just before Cyclone Bobby went through. Although they had a very wet season in 1989, they have had continuous years of no rain, let alone little rain, ever since. There was mostly cattle in those areas, and the cattle numbers went down and down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the pastoral industry in Western Australia in the Gascoyne, Murchison and Kimberley regions&mdash;there is also some pastoral industry in the Pilbara region, which is where most of Australia's iron ore is mined&mdash;you will find that not one station has gone into liquidation since the inception of the pastoral industry in those areas, and to my knowledge the pastoral industry started there in about the 1880s. They were resilient people; they are still resilient people. While those pastoralists are in this situation, the government should do something to help them such as offer them low interest loans or what could be better described as an interest subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are not many people in this place who may know that those pastoralists in those areas can never borrow from a banking institution. The simple reason is the tenure of the property of those pastoralists. They are on finite leases and they will all expire in the year 2015. Whether they will be renewed in 2015 will have a lot to do with the Native Title Act, which went through this parliament some time back. But that is not the debate at hand today. We will have plenty of opportunities down the track to debate that. Because the pastoralists' properties are on finite leases&mdash;the banking institutions will not take a station as collateral&mdash;they have to borrow on the stock at hand: cattle, sheep or whatever they may have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only lending institutions for that are the stockbrokers&mdash;for example, Elders, Wesfarmers in Western Australia and Dalgety or whatever it is called over here. They are the only ones. Those institutions have to charge higher interest because they do not have the access to low interest money that the banking institutions have. So those pastoralists are in a harder position than most other pastoralists or farmers who have to borrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government continually refuses to help them. I have spoken to Senator Bob Collins about the situation at various times. I have spoken in this place. The Western Australian government has taken the issue up for those people. Over the last five years, they have had four years of almost nil rainfall. So their stock numbers have got down to 25 per cent. A few stations received stewardship grants, which are about $20,000. That amount means nothing to stations of that size. Mind you, when things are running normally, these stations turn out 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 head of cattle per year. They are not small figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, they are taking up that very important export market of live cattle. One of the reasons there are more and more live cattle going out of Western Australia is that the abattoirs of the north have closed. The antiquated industrial relations system took all the abattoirs out. I believe the only abattoir working now in all of the pastoral industry of Western Australia is at Broome. The nearest one is in Geraldton, or in Perth or in Katherine in the Northern Territory. So they are in a very tight economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still for them, as far as the economic situation is concerned, is that they have had these drought-breaking rains, up to 12 or 15 inches in some places&mdash;Halls Creek has had 30 to 40 inches, but I am talking more about Gascoyne and Murchison&mdash;there is feed as high as this table and they do not have enough cattle. You would think the government would have some commonsense. It does not matter about compassion; leave the compassion bit out. The commonsense approach is that the low interest subsidy could be put into those places. A hundredfold reward would then be reaped when they start moving their cattle out again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond those stations is the big danger that we will lose those markets in South-East Asia. The Prime Minister keeps telling us that our direction is towards South-East Asia. I agree with him that more and more trade with them, without selling our souls, is all the better for us. They are right on our doorstep. But if we lose those live cattle markets to, say, South America or even America itself&mdash;and they like their live cattle&mdash;the only other viable place is South America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to start losing our markets to those places, we would be in trouble. Would it be beyond the realms of possibility that the government could still do something for them now, otherwise we will miss out on many opportunities down the line? I am asking the government to look at that issue again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time available to me, I would like to look at federal government financial assistance grants to local government. As a result of this budget, we are about to get a bill which seeks to alter the system of financial assistance grants to local governments around Australia because the 1986 agreement runs out on 30 June this year. We will have a chance to debate that issue in the weeks to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out to the chamber and the rest of Australia that, under this new legislation, general purpose grants will continue to be separately identified. That is something I have always wanted. This government has gone away from untied grants to local government. Most of my colleagues accepted the untied grants. I certainly never did, and I have been proved to be right. There were only two or three of us who did not accept those untied grants. This new legislation seeks to have those general purpose grants separately identified, and there is a move to tie them too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me is that, when these grants are distributed to state government commissions, the interest rates will still be done by those state government commissions but the allocations will be performed on the basis of national principles declared by the federal minister. I am afraid that we will have another Kelly whiteboard situation if this is not looked at carefully. I urge those people who wish to talk on those bills to look at that. I can assure you that in the weeks and months to come I will make sure that we will not go down that line as directed by the federal minister. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation passed by the Parliament last year as Acts Nos. 146 and 159 of 1994 set the new rate of charge at $27 in respect of departures from Australia after 1 January 1995. At the time that legislation was being considered by the Parliament, the Government also made known its intention to commence negotiations with international air and sea passenger carriers to have them collect the PMC as part of their ticketing arrangements, thereby removing the need for departure tax stamp booths at international departure points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiations with airlines are in their final stages and the airlines' representatives have given their in principle agreement for the airlines to enter into arrangements to collect PMC from passengers departing after 1 July 1995. For the first 12 months of the new collection regime, when airlines will still be establishing collection procedures, the PMC stamp booths will remain at international airports to ensure that those passengers who have not prepaid the PMC as part of the price of a ticket will be able to pay before departing Australia. The airlines understand that at the end of this transitional period the booths will cease to operate and the airlines will assume sole responsibility for PMC collection.

CASA's regulatory functions include standard setting, safety surveillance of the industry and enforcement of standards, entry control and licensing. Its additional responsibilities include regulatory oversight of the national airways system, air traffic services and aviation rescue and fire-fighting services provided by Airservices Australia and administration of the carriers' mandatory death or injury insurance arrangements which the Government announced on 12 October 1994. CASA will also be required to place much greater emphasis on safety awareness and education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia constitute a tripartite structure for providing safe aviation, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system. The Government also intends to introduce separate legislation to increase BASI's capacity to conduct more sophisticated, systemic investigations and analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The target date for the establishment of CASA and Airservices Australia is 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The separation of the regulatory and service-provider functions, as proposed in the two bills before the Senate, will provide a much clearer focus on aviation safety regulation and ensure that there is no conflict with the more commercial goals of the service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 March 1995 the Minister for Transport referred the bills to the House of Representatives' Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for comment. The Committee sought comments on the bills and took evidence at a public hearing during the week commencing 24 April. It issued an advisory report on</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am grateful to that Committee for conducting its Aviation bills inquiry at short notice and for the constructive comments in its advisory report. I will address the Committee's specific recommendations later in the speech.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives' Standing Committee's 11 May advisory report noted that there was broad support for the establishment of an independent aviation safety authority and endorsed this approach. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The creation of a new authority with a new and more specialised board and a new director is a far better solution for the troubled world of aviation safety regulation in Australia than any reorganisation within the existing Civil Aviation Authority."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of safety is reinforced in both bills through a requirement that, in exercising powers and performing their functions, CASA and Airservices Australia must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CASA's leadership, strategic direction and management of aviation safety will be considerably enhanced through its establishment as an independent authority, the appointment of an acknowledged expert on aviation safety as its new Director and the subsequent appointment of a small, expert Board. CASA's Board will comprise a Chairperson, the Director of Aviation Safety and up to three other members. A major priority for the Board and the Director of Aviation Safety will be to address the various management problems that have emerged over the last twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister may give CASA written instructions as to the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers but, in respect of the performance of CASA's regulatory function, the directions shall be only of a general nature. The bill also provides that the Minister may give CASA notices about its strategic direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes provision for CASA to produce a corporate plan that includes objectives, strategies and performance measures, an analysis of aviation safety risk factors and human resource and industrial relations strategies. The Minister must respond to the plan and may direct the Board to vary the plan. As recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee, the legislation has been amended by the House to require the corporate plan to be tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the proposed responsibility and accountability framework in the bill provides a proper balance between the exercise of Ministerial strategic direction and accountability and the day-to-day exercise by CASA of its functions and powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to safety being the most important consideration, CASA will be required to have regard to the environment in the exercise of its functions. This will ensure that, as far as possible, the community will be protected from any adverse effects of aircraft operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the importance of Air Operators' Certificates (AOCs) as a safety regulatory tool in respect of commercial operators, the CASA legislation brings together the main requirements relating to AOCs in a single integrated set of provisions. Currently these provisions appear in a variety of regulatory documents and consolidation of the provisions will make them more accessible both to industry and the regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is made for CASA to be the body responsible for ensuring that all carriers of passengers are insured against their liability for death or injury to passengers. The Government has already introduced legislation to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act to make it mandatory for all operators to be so insured.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced in October 1994, the Government will continue to fund that part of aviation safety regulation that has been identified as the public benefit component, for example, standard setting, enforcement and provision of safety awareness information. Other aspects of aviation safety regulation, which primarily benefit the travelling public and the aviation industry, will continue to be met by a combination of charges and levies on the aviation industry. These proposed cost recovery arrangements for CASA will be reviewed prior to preparation of the 1996/97 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has agreed to a number of initiatives for CASA to enhance its effectiveness in providing safety regulation to the Australian aviation industry. The most important include the Aviation Safety Surveillance Program (which will provide an assessment of the safety health of the aviation industry and enable implementation of follow up responses) and a review of the system of flight crew testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision has been made in the bill for the transfer of assets and for the transfer of staff, under the same terms and conditions that apply at present, from the Civil Aviation Authority to the new Authority. The Government also intends that rights, debts, liabilities and obligations (including insurance aspects) will be allocated to CASA in accordance with the functions transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation provides that both CASA and Airservices Australia must, where appropriate, consult with Government, industrial, commercial, consumer and other relevant bodies and organisations, including the International Civil Aviation Organization and bodies representing the aviation industry. Both the Boards of CASA and Airservices Australia will be asked to provide the Minister for Transport with proposals for consultative arrangements with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the House of Representatives' Standing Committee's Aviation Bills Inquiry, the Government has accepted ten of the twelve recommendations totally or substantially. As appropriate, the bill has been amended by the House to give effect to the recommendations accepted by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, CASA's functions have been reclassified to avoid any confusion between the object clause and the functions clause. The bill also includes a number of technical amendments by the House to accommodate, inter alia, suggested changes proposed by the Senate's Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives' Standing Committee noted that item 28 of the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill omits subsection 10(2) of the Civil Aviation Act. That subsection requires the Authority, in so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, to "have regard to any costs that would arise from complying with the standards". Some industry representatives indicated concern that the ultimate issue of cost might not be addressed and that a focus on enabling more people to participate in aviation would recognise that regulation has its costs without explicit reference to costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee proposed that the object clause be a broad in-principle statement of purpose which should include reference to the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation and that, pending the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill, subsection 10(2) of the Civil Aviation Act be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the Committee's proposed changes to the object clause run the risk of diluting the safety intent of the bill. They seek to establish a dual mandate for CASA by requiring CASA not only to regulate aviation safety but to foster the aviation industry. They introduce uncertainty as to how CASA should "recognise the need for more people to benefit from civil aviation" and they could be used to challenge the validity of safety rules on the basis that they may have an economic impact on industry. In short, they involve the inclusion of the concept of "affordable safety" under another name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also present a real danger of what the Committee described as "regulatory capture"&mdash;which could happen if CASA (the regulator) is seen to be "accountable" to industry (the regulated). As the Committee itself noted:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"CASA should be accountable to the minister, the Parliament and the courts and to no one else."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers the question of costs is most appropriately addressed through the relevant provisions of the Legislative Instruments Bill. Under this bill, CASA will be required to put in place a mandatory consultation process before any civil aviation regulation is made to ensure that all affected persons have an opportunity to comment. CASA will also be required to prepare a Legislative Instruments Proposal which contains a summary of the proposal and its objectives, an analysis of alternatives to meet the objectives, an indication of relative costs and benefits to Government and the affected public of the proposal and alternatives and reasons for the preferred approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the Committee's concerns, the object clause has been amended in the House so that it is a broad in-principle statement of purpose as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The main object of this Act is to establish a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety of civil aviation, with particular emphasis on preventing aviation accidents and incidents."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A written direction will also be issued to the CASA Board immediately upon its establishment requiring CASA to comply with the relevant provisions in the Legislative Instruments bill, pending its enactment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that the purpose of clause 28(2) be elaborated. This clause provides that the financial position of the applicant is one of the matters that CASA may take into account in issuing an Air Operator's Certificate. Clause 28BC(3) enables CASA to take into account the financial position of an AOC holder when making a decision to impose or vary AOC conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the broad strategy to improve air safety regulation in Australia, the Minister for Transport issued a written direction to the Civil Aviation Authority that it should establish a formal system which would trigger an automatic increase in safety surveillance of any operator found to be in financial defaults.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that CASA has a safety regulatory role: it does not provide CASA with the powers of an economic regulator to control the entry and licensing of operators in the industry or to monitor their financial affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill, nevertheless, allows CASA to take into account information about financial viability in order to assess whether the applicant can meet other provisions, for example, the requirement to maintain an appropriate organisation, with a sufficient number of qualified personnel and an effective management structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial problems do not necessarily imply that safety standards are not being met. However, the bill empowers CASA to have regard to information about the financial viability of a particular operator in deciding whether or not to conduct a detailed safety audit of the operator. To make it mandatory to consider the financial position of an operator would interfere with CASA's responsibilities as a safety regulator since CASA would be required to undertake a financial viability test before it could suspend or cancel an AOC, with consequent, and potentially damaging, delays in CASA taking the necessary regulatory enforcement action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 20A of the Civil Aviation Act contains offences in relation to the flying or operation of aircraft in a manner likely to endanger life or cause danger to person or property. The Director of Public Prosecutions advised that it was difficult in some circumstances to obtain a conviction under this section, principally because the risk of danger that would have to be proved would be substantial or probable danger, even to the extent of actual injuries being sustained. The bill therefore contains amendments to section 20A along the lines proposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns have been raised that the proposed amendment casts the net too wide in that legitimate aviation activities, such as training pilots, could be in breach of the revised provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the Government has withdrawn the amendments to section 20A from the bill, that is, the current position stands. I have</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">asked the House of Representatives' Standing Committee to look specifically at the issue as part of its broader inquiry into air safety standards in the commuter and general aviation sectors with the aim of striking an appropriate balance between the public interest in preventing dangerous flying and the legitimate needs of the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, senators will be aware that there are a number of inquiries into aspects of aviation safety at present, including the Standing Committee's Aviation Safety inquiry and the Staunton inquiry into certain aspects of the operations of the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to Seaview Air.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the significance of the structural changes encompassed by these bills, the Government is unwilling to delay their implementation until the outcome of these inquiries is known. However, the Government will give careful consideration to the findings of these inquiries and report to Parliament on its proposed responses, including any necessary legislative amendments. I note that the House's Standing Committee accepted the need for the two bills to be passed in the current sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that this legislation package will give a clearer and stronger focus on aviation safety and restore public and industry confidence in the safety of aviation operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AIR SERVICES BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my second reading speech introducing the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, I said that the two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia, together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, will constitute a tri-partite structure, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to establish Airservices Australia as the airways service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airservices Australia will be established as a government business enterprise (GBE). Its functions will include the provision of airways facilities and air traffic services, an aeronautical information service, a national aviation rescue and fire-fighting service, an aviation search and rescue service and radio navigation and tele-communications. Additionally, Airservices Australia will be required to undertake specified environmental functions such as noise monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the performance of its functions, Airservices Australia, like the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration. Subject to this requirement, the bill makes provision for Airservices Australia to perform its functions in a manner that ensures that, as far as is practicable, the environment is protected from the effects of aircraft operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airservices Australia will be governed by a Board comprising a Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer and six other members, appointed on a part-time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The finance provisions in the Air Services Bill, including those relating to the corporate plan, are consistent with provisions contained in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1995 which establishes core accountability and finance provisions for Commonwealth bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions relating to Ministerial direction, the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and miscellaneous matters are adapted from those provisions applying to the former Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives' Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure's Aviation Bills inquiry in an advisory report, dated 11 May 1995, commenting on this bill and the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, recommended that the corporate plans of both organisations be tabled in Parliament within 15 sitting days of the Minister receiving the final version. I have accepted this recommendation in relation to CASA because of the nature of its plan </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a broad strategic document rather than a business plan. However, the Government considers that such a recommendation in relation to Airservices Australia is inconsistent with Government policy that such documents remain confidential between the Minister and the GBE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like the Civil Aviation Authority, Airservices Australia will be required to pay payroll taxes but will not presently be liable to pay other taxes under any law of a State or Territory. I propose that a review be conducted next year to examine the nature of the Airservices Australia enterprise and its capital structure. The application of all State and Territory taxes to Airservices Australia, consistent with the Competition Principles Agreement agreed by Commonwealth, State and Territory leaders at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in April 1995, will also be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill further proposes that Airservices Australia will inherit the rights, debts, liabilities and obligations (including insurance aspects) and assets of the service provider functions of the former Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relevant staff will be compulsorily transferred from the Civil Aviation Authority to Airservices Australia on its establishment under the same terms and conditions that apply at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of Airservices Australia, without the regulatory function of the former Civil Aviation Authority, will enable the new body to continue to serve Australia and international aviation by providing world class aviation services and facilities. The Government looks to Airservices Australia to build upon these achievements in the future.</PARA>
