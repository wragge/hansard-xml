That is not a part of the record but there were people in the chamber who heard me say that and it could be regarded as a reflection on the government, the Manager of Government Business (Senator Faulkner), the whip and the Parliamentary Liaison Office. I want to point out to the Senate that, in fact, my office was briefed and I am reminded that I also was briefed. I do apologise that my mind at that stage was 2,000 miles away.

<PARA>Clause 4 of this bill allows a carer pensioner to accompany the person they are caring for overseas for up to three months in any one calendar year and continue to receive their pension. This is certainly a step forward because until now, except in limited circumstances, carers have lost their pensions as soon as they leave the country. It remains the case, however, that the portability of the carees pension is much greater&mdash;12 months in most cases, and occasionally longer. In other words, under the government's proposal, carers will lose their pension much earlier than the person they are caring for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that the carer pension should be portable for up to 12 months, and this is what my first amendment seeks to put in place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Woodley points out, the Australian Democrats are seeking these amendments to the provision dealing with the portability of the carer pension. The government's bill provides that a carer pensioner would be able to accompany their carer overseas, without loss of qualification, provided the period of absence does not exceed three months in a calendar year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats propose that this three-month period be extended to 12 months in line with the current wife pension and that other provisions relating to the portability of both pensions be brought into line. The justification is that the Department of Social Security has stated to the committee that there will be a small number of people involved, and hence the costs will be small. The inquiry is seeking information that cost implications have not confirmed this assertion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What these amendments are about has been clearly explained by both Senator Woodley and Senator Patterson. The government is opposing these amendments. The argument has been put that one of the reasons for these amendments is that when carers were overseas it was actually during the carer's respite period and a carer would not be treated as in respite if the carer was, in fact, caring for the caree on the trip overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments introduced in the bill would address the unintended consequence by allowing the payment of the carers pension for up to three months while the carer accompanies the caree on a temporary absence from Australia.

<PARA>Honourable senators will remember that in November last year we debated the legislation introducing the widow allowance for women who were widowed, separated or divorced after they turned 50. In the course of that debate I moved an amendment which would have made the widow allowance more widely available; in particular it would have allowed women who were widowed, separated or divorced after they turned 40 to claim the allowance after they turned 50, provided that they had not had any recent work force experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very minor amendment and certainly does not go anywhere near as far as I would like to go but, if one cannot take the giant leaps which are required, then one takes smaller steps in the hope that others will follow. As I said at that stage, the practical effect of my amendment would have been that a woman who lost her husband when she was, say, 45 years old would have had five years to test the job market and, if she could not get a job in that time, she would have had the option of changing from the jobsearch allowance to the widow allowance. These two payments are made at the same rate, but the great advantage for older women is that there is no requirement under the widow allowance for women to look for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, however, voted against my amendment and I recall that the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security gave absolutely no reason for the government's position.

That petition was not widely distributed but, even with the limited distribution it had, we got 15,000 signatures. That certainly indicates to me that, in the mind of the community, there is an injustice occurring, an injustice that this parliament alone has the power to correct.

There is increasing pressure of economic arguments being placed on women in particular, and in this instance we are thinking about women who are suffering the grief of widowhood. The pressure of economic arguments is forcing the government to reduce its responsibility in this area, and it is something that we do not agree with. We are not necessarily convinced, as Senator Woodley has said, that this is the best measure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to place some comments on the record. Widow allowance was introduced on 1 January 1995 to provide an income support option for older women who have lost the support of a partner later in life and who have no recent work force experience. These women made career and life choices under more traditional expectations of their labour market participation and are now particularly disadvantaged in facing the labour market for the first time because they spent long periods out of the work force caring for their family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is increasing, the work force participation rate for women over 55 remains significantly lower than for those aged between 45 and 54. The age restriction on widow allowance avoids the problem that existed with the old widow B pension, where a woman could become widowed or separated at age 40, for example, work between 40 and 50 and then retire, claiming a pension at age 50. There is no reason why this particular group of women should be able to retire earlier than the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that women who lose the support of a partner at a younger age will generally be more able to participate in the work force and would benefit most from other measures designed to assist and encourage work force participation. I am interested in the letter that Senator Woodley read out. In that woman's case, she went back to work. She has recent work force participation. She has not been out of the work force for many years. Far be it from me to be diagnosing across the chamber, but the grief seemed to be a significant part of that person's problem, not an absence from work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now very much the case that many more women have not had very long periods out of the work force by the time they are 40. An increasing number of women have had work force experience to that time. It is also true, in the government's view, that jobsearch allowance remains a better option than either widow allowance or partner allowance because it provides access to a full range of labour market programs, including the job compact. One of the significant changes the government has introduced with its labour market changes is that people are not forgotten or ignored. It is not a case of just taking your money and off you go. Under those programs, not only is information and access to courses and other programs available; there is also the opportunity that your name and information are available so that you are not forgotten and left alone to drift. We have been told by a lot of long-term unemployed people that that has been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to encouraging and supporting women to participate in the paid work force to best ensure their financial security. The government considers that long-term dependency on any form of income support is not something the community should support or can afford to encourage. Long-term dependency can also be isolating for people. If a woman widowed at an earlier age has been unemployed for at least 12 months at age 50, the requirements to report efforts to look for work are considerably relaxed, compared to normal requirements imposed on younger unemployed people. In fact, for those women the general requirements for continued receipt of newstart allowance are only marginally more than those applying for widow allowance. I think this is also very important, and I hope Senator Woodley's letter-writing people are aware of those sorts of important differences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older women who do not qualify for widow allowance may also qualify for other forms of assistance, such as disability support pension or sickness allowance if there is some medical reason why they are not able to look for work. It is important to say that these changes are not a matter of a heartless government, but a government that is trying to be exactly the opposite, trying to remain encouraging and supportive of people continuing to feel part of the community and participate in it, rather than effectively being given a ticket to retire at a very early age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for her answer. In the minister's case and probably in the government's case I understand that they are trying to do the right thing and we commended the government when it introduced the widow allowance last year. But I need to say to the minister&mdash;I want to ask a question in a moment but I will make these remarks&mdash;that all of the great hopes that she has for these particular women we are talking about are not shared by those same women. I am not talking about just a handful; I am talking about thousands of women, certainly hundreds who have contacted me by letter and by phone. They are aware of the complexity of the issue. Some of these women have become very well informed throughout the whole process, particularly in Rockhampton in Queensland where a group of them are very active. They are now a resource for the Department of Social Security in that place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there are still issues. One of the problems, minister, is the fact that, although the government puts in place what it hopes will be policy amendments that will help people, these do not always percolate down through the system. For instance, the very good initiative by the government to allow women over 50 to report only every 12 weeks has now been interfered with by the whole issue of case management. Many of the case managers go to women who have a 12-week reporting period and tell them that that is not so. The women are told that they have to be under the control of the case manager, often someone who is many years younger than them, and have to do this, that and something else. So the practice often is not following what the government hopes might be the case. There is a real issue there and I hope the government will take account of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe that our amendment will solve all the problems. In a sense it is a little like what Senator Chamarette is saying. We are wanting by this amendment to signal that there are still many problems and we intend to press the amendment for that reason. But I have a question for you, minister. Let me not get too eloquent at this point. The question is this: minister, I understand there is to be a major revaluation of the phasing out of the widow B pension to be undertaken next year. I know that many of the women who have contacted my office are keen to let the government know of the difficulties they often encounter. Could you inform me as to whether or not there will be an opportunity for members of the public to provide input into that evaluation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I am terribly sorry you said that because I have not known this to be much in your character, but that level of behaviour, the puerile attacking of people in this place, is one of the reasons why I would turn to eloquence. I thought, actually, that that was amazing. Even people in the kindergartens of this country are not that nasty. Correcting people for mispronunciations of language, or words, as you understand them, senator, does not do anything for you. It is not a very edifying spectacle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley, as I say, a case for eloquence is reinforced by the minute. Can I say, senator, about your point that people only have to go back every 12 weeks to check, if that is being contradicted by the information that people are getting through the office, then that is a matter of concern. I will make sure that that report from you is passed through to the minister's office so that he can follow that up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the opportunity for people&mdash;particularly the Rockhampton group, but others as well&mdash;to be able to put in information, if you like, so as to be part of the consultation process regarding evaluation, I do not have that information. I am not able to give that assurance to you, but again I will certainly make sure that I will pass that on to the minister to see whether there is anything further that I can bring back to you. On the face of it, it would certainly seem, as you say, that these people have a lot of information, so it would seem reasonable to hear from them about the proposed changes. </PARA>

I did not take the opportunity to speak in detail on clauses 41 to 75 and left it for the debate on clauses 76 to 137. But the reasons are the same for our opposition to clauses 41 to 75.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation arises because the provision dispenses with the need for a department decision as to whether the client is payable or not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Division 18 of the bill contains a provision that seeks to effect two separate objectives. The first is to provide that, subject to the existing provisions in the act, once qualification is lost, the pension, benefit or allowance&mdash;as the case may be&mdash;ceases to be payable. You can check that in section 71AB, a new section inserted by clause 42. The second is to provide a period of grace for those social security customers who incur a maximum payment rate debt but who have complied with their notification of obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple principle underlying the qualification amendments is that a social security payment should not be payable once qualification for the payment is lost. Most people would expect this to be the case. It is important not to confuse these amendments with provisions dealing with recovery of debts to the Commonwealth. These amendments will make any payment made after qualification ceases a debt. They do not affect customers' rights of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments do not preclude waiver of the resulting debt if it was due to administrative error by the department; and they do not mean recovery will be pursued against the customer if that would cause financial hardship. The amendments provide for greater accountability. They ensure that the department takes prompt action by requiring it to record and report on debts that arise in situations where payments continue beyond qualification. On the other hand, the view expressed by the Welfare Rights Centre, if followed, would allow the department to rest on its laurels because the centre says there is no debt, no matter how long the department takes to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 18 also contains amendments to benefit customers by creating a period of grace for maximum payment rate debts. These amendments will provide that if a customer incurs a maximum payment rate debt&mdash;that is, if the client is paid more than he or she was, in fact, entitled to but has notified the department of the relevant change of circumstances as required&mdash;then no debt arises in the notification period. An example is section 73B inserted by clause 45. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public's confidence in the welfare system will be undermined if the Australian Democrats are successful in preventing amendments that seek to give legal force to the commonsense notion that welfare payments should not be paid to people who are not qualified for them and should be recoverable if they are paid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to draw the attention of the committee to a particular case. It is one that is of great concern to the National Brain Injury Foundation. It is about a woman who has been struggling to support herself and her two teenage children for four years since her husband sustained a severe brain injury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a valiant battle to survive, the husband is now permanently and inappropriately accommodated in a geriatric nursing home, despite the fact that he is relatively young. I hasten to add that the nursing home is of the highest standard in every respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person concerned initially had a superannuation payout of $30,000, which is managed by the Public Trustee. The wife works full time to provide for her children. She also provides her husband's clothing and other items relevant to his comfort and care at the weekends. Because she is earning a modest salary which must meet all expenses&mdash;rent, household expenditure, food, education, clothing, et cetera&mdash;her husband is denied his full pension and, therefore, his pension does not meet his nursing home costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this now because the Minister for Social Security, Peter Baldwin, has been written to about this matter but to no avail. In addition, the mother's carer's pension has been cut due to the fact that she earns a salary. The amount held by the Public Trustee continues to reduce their ability to meet the balance of the nursing home costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One solution put to her was to pay approximately $180 per fortnight towards his nursing home costs&mdash;money she simply does not have. An alternative suggestion put to her was to divorce her husband, which would then mean his nursing home costs would be covered&mdash;an unthinkable act for her and her children to consider. She is, however, being pressured into this course of action because of financial circumstances. What a suggestion to make! What is wrong with our social security system if it says to these people that they should get divorced and then the whole thing will be covered? That is an unthinkable thing for this person and her children to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family do not live in their own home. The National Brain Injury Foundation was able to assist in obtaining housing trust accommodation, but the house is so small&mdash;no built-ins&mdash;that what little furniture they did own is being minded, was sold for a pittance or was given away in the desperation of leaving, with little notice once the housing trust house became available, the home they had all shared prior to the husband's accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their only assets are a motor vehicle in his name, the most meagre of household possessions and the remains of the superannuation held by the Public Trustee, to which the wife has no access. There are weeks when she has a nil balance in her account while struggling to meet rental, living and schooling costs. The National Brain Injury Foundation says that it is personally aware of these details&mdash;and I will not go into that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wife and her children are trying to cope with the unrelenting grief that comes with the loss of a loved one through brain injury, where the person is still alive but different and unable to function in the `normal community'. However, he has certain functions and is being cared for. The National Brain Injury Foundation is very concerned about the wife's state of health and that of both children. They were once quite comfortable, but now they must battle with these endless practicalities and also with the loss of the husband and father they once knew, who is now in a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks the following has happened to add unbelievable strain to this family. The wife received a letter from Social Security advising that between March 1992 and September 1993&mdash;and this is where the relevance of these particular amendments comes in&mdash;the wife had been overpaid $3,139.90. This is at a time when the family was in shock. She had no recollection of how this could have happened, nor any proof that it in fact did. At the time of the accident she had been working part time and, to manage financially, took an offer to work longer hours. However, she believed Social Security was always kept in the picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter stated that she was required to pay this amount of $3,139.90 as quickly as possible and preferably before 22 July 1995&mdash;a week following the receipt of the letter from the Department of Social Security. She contacted Social Security and spoke with a particular person whose christian name is mentioned here&mdash;I will not say it in the parliament&mdash;a very caring member of staff and, as best she could, she explained this very complicated and heart-breaking position. It was agreed that papers would be sent for her to negotiate the payment of $10 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person concerned then received a letter dated 10 August stating that her pension of $123.80 per fortnight had been cut to $1 per fortnight&mdash;$1 per fortnight! As she had given approval for Social Security to request any information from her employer at the time, she believed that she may have suddenly earned an amount over the threshold and thus these payments had been cut. This proved not to be the case and the stopping of the payment was related to the stated overpayment of $3,139.90. Worse was to come as her pension was also cut but later reinstated&mdash;and there is more of that to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter that I have indicates that the National Brain Injury Foundation understands that an agreement has now been made to repay $10 per fortnight, but not before the stress of all this has had the most detrimental effect on this woman's health and the health of her family at a time when her daughter was suffering the prospect and then the effect of surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately one month ago she went to the family chemist where an account is operated for her husband which is paid by the Public Trustee. Their daughter was about to enter hospital for fairly major surgery and she therefore asked to add to the account a toothbrush, toothpaste, a wet-pack bag and some ointment for her skin allergy. She had added similar creams and ointment items for skin treatment on approximately three occasions and, at her husband's request, some aftershave for his son's birthday. It should be noted that the wife is, of course, his sole guardian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was grossly embarrassed when the chemist said she was not able to provide anything on the account. She was humiliated beyond imagination in front of other customers and was told that the Public Trustee had contacted the chemist on two occasions and had said that she could not add anything to the account other than the items specifically for her husband. Although the Public Trustee had contacted the chemist, he had not contacted the wife with the information he had given to the chemist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go much further because much of this relates to the Public Trustee. But I do want to raise this question because it does show the great concern that many people have and the effect that the interpretation of the legislation has on a particular individual about whom the National Brain Injury Foundation has written to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I do not think the Minister for Social Security has responded to those letters. The National Brain Injury Foundation stated in its letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People in her position are exhausted by the medical system which denies their loved ones rehabilitation, by the legal system which is a mystery to them, by the constant hospital and nursing home visits, by the need to be mother and father and carer 24 hours of every day, and by the constant financial battle. As one person who knows this battlefield well has so aptly stated&mdash;"They are set up to fail".</PARA>

I would like to build on the relevance of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section of the bill we are debating is basically one where the department is raising the capacity to provide for the raising of a debt to the Commonwealth under certain circumstances in which people are paid amounts of money to which they are not entitled. It has been pointed out that this can be a highly difficult proposition for some people who have been in the position of the woman who was being discussed earlier, and who should be a symbol of what we are trying to do in being more fair with our social security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was actually the Welfare Rights Centre that pointed out the inequity of raising a debt action against a person when the miscalculation was the fault of the Department of Social Security either by way of not processing client provided information or miscalculating rates of payment. Clearly, such a situation cannot stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair to the Department of Social Security, it has pointed out that where a person in good faith continues to receive a payment to which they are not entitled and does not inform the Department of Social Security of relevant changes there is no mechanism to raise a debt under the act as it now stands. However, under the act, as it would be amended as we are discussing today, raising a debt administratively and pursuing recovery would be two separate steps of the process. Where the client has acted in good faith and the fault lies with the Department of Social Security, debt recovery would not be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this whole basis of putting people into an indebted situation that leads to the kinds of concerns generated by people in the position that Senator Harradine has cited. That is the point I really want to make the connection with because, while there is a difference between the actual amendment and the position that is being presented here and that of debt recovery, the minute people get into an indebted situation they fall into the same dilemma that has been vividly illustrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case where a client has provided information which has not been acted on, the new provisions would allow that the debt would start accumulating at the end of the notification period during which the change of circumstances occurred, not on the day after the change occurred. This is provided as some sort of incentive for people to report changes. Once again, the Welfare Rights Centre points out that not only would it be unjust for the Department of Social Security to be able to raise a debt against a person when the mistake has been made by the Department of Social Security, but such a provision could also lead to a slackening of the DSS internal controls if raising a debt becomes so much easier and holds no backlash for the officer raising the debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DSS has been arguing that in a situation where the client does not notify the changes&mdash;which would now result in a debt being raised&mdash;this provision will provide an incentive for DSS to be more diligent because the means of recovery would be available. It is using a structural and system based approach. I believe that we need to look at it from the client perspective. We ought to be considering the situation in which we are assisting the department to have a technical capacity to make people indebted. Even though we are not considering the recovery process&mdash;and we have some guarantees from the department that, where it is at fault, it will not pursue the matter&mdash;the very principle that we are instituting is one of indebtedness to people who may not deserve to have the debt placed against them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995 contains several separate provisions. There are, in fact, five main provisions, each of them different from the others.

The coalition will not be opposing the migration bills. We support most of the provisions in the bills, but there are some comments I want to make about certain aspects along the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the first of the issues is concerned&mdash;that is, amendments to detention procedures&mdash;the Senate will recall that in February 1994 the Joint Standing Committee on Migration tabled its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, Border Control and Detention</EMPHASIS>. Two of the main recommendations of that report were recommendations 10 and 11. Recommendation 10 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unauthorised border arrivals who claim refugee status be held in detention during the determination of their status, including during administrative processing, administrative review and any legal appeals, but that there be a capacity to consider release where the period of detention exceeds six months.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in cases where unauthorised border arrivals who claim refugee status have been held in detention for more than six months, and the continued detention has been brought about by a lack of action or administrative error by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in accordance with the Minister's powers under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Migration Reform Act 1992</EMPHASIS>, give consideration to including such detained asylum seekers in a prescribed class of detention non-citizens eligible for the grant of a bridging visa, which secures release from detention.</PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering whether to include in the prescribed class all or any such detainees, the Minister have regard to the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether the applicant has a special need based on age, health, or previous experiences of torture and trauma;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether the applicant has satisfied appropriate health, character and security checks;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the likelihood that the applicant would abscond if granted a bridging visa;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether there is a reasonable basis for the applicant's claim to refugee status;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the timeliness of the lodgement of the application for refugee status;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the extent to which the applicant co-operated with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the provision of information relevant to the applicant's claim;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether there will be adequate support arrangements if the applicant is released into the community; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>This part of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) now before the Senate seeks to implement recommendations 10 and 11 by providing the minister with a non-delegatable, non-compellable discretion to declare a person eligible for release if certain conditions are met. The provisions of the bill will ensure that only those illegal entrants who have been detained for more than six months due to the failure of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to process their applications or determine their status in that time, will be eligible for release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another aspect of these amendments to the detention procedures which I think is not unimportant, is that those unlawful non-citizens who remain in detention after their cases have been fully determined by the department and by the other processes that are available because they seek judicial review, will not be part of the release provisions. That is an aspect with which the coalition agrees. In respect of these provisions of the bill, the coalition has no difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second part of the bill relates to the migration agents registration scheme, commonly known as MARS. The bill seeks to extend by one year, until September 1996, the operation of the present provisions to allow the government time to consider and respond to another report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and to provide time for the passage of any relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration covered the inquiry into the operation of the migration agents registration scheme. That inquiry was conducted earlier this year. I think the report was tabled in the Senate in May or June. The committee recommended in the report that the scheme be extended for a three-year period so that its operation could be further examined. The registration scheme has only been in operation since 1992. It was subject to High Court challenge for most of that period. It is only relatively recently that that challenge has been removed in the sense of the High Court's decision to throw out the challenge to the validity of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has been operating freely without challenge on a small time scale. It was the view of the committee and certainly the strong view of the coalition that the jury is still out in many respects on the operation of the migration agents registration scheme. More time is required to assess how worthwhile it is and how appropriate it is. The committee recommended an additional three years of operation because it did not think there had been sufficient time to judge whether the scheme, as a long-term proposition, was the most desirable to meet the necessary objective of achieving a competent and efficient migration agents system within which the professionalism and integrity of the participants is of the highest order. I think there is total agreement on that objective. The question is how best to get there and whether the scheme, as it presently operates, is the most desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing legislation, the scheme is due to end in September. Therefore, if it is to continue, it is necessary to have an extension. The government is going for a one-year extension. From the way the legislation is drafted and from what the minister has said in relation to the reasons for extension, it intimates that a decision is still to be taken by the government as to what might happen beyond September 1996. It would certainly be the case with a coalition government by that time that we would want to carefully look at all aspects of the scheme before deciding what, if anything, to do about it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect of the bill before us relates to passenger cards. The bill seeks to add more flexibility to the required questions on the passenger card. If the bill is passed, in future the questions will not be limited to topics stipulated in the Migration Act. At present, the Migration Act states that questions regarding a non-citizen's health, criminal record, purpose of visit and the like, including any unpaid debts to Australia and any previous deportations or removals from Australia or another country, are exclusively required to be asked. Questions outside that range cannot be asked. The government is seeking more flexibility in relation to the possible questions that it may ask and, according to the department, that is necessary. We have had discussions with the department and we accept the proposition at this stage that this provision is an acceptable one&mdash;in other words, one which will add more flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passenger card is one of the security measures used to protect our borders. It is filled out by inbound non-citizens and collected for use at immigration clearance at the port of entry. Many changes are occurring in the whole processing of the entry of non-citizens to Australia. I am sure that there will be many more changes in the future. Elements of that, including the whole question of our universal visa system, are being examined at the moment by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and, I am sure, by the government. I am sure that we will be seeing more changes of this nature in future. It is something that we need to keep a close watch on so that we enable the necessary flexibility to be built into the system whilst, at the same time, having a system which enables us to have confidence in the integrity of our border entry provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth item in the bill is the repeal of the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act 1992. With the implementation of the provisions of the Migration Reform Act 1992 on 1 September 1994, the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act 1992 also came into effect. The tax imposed under this act was intended to serve as an incentive for visa overstayers to come forward at an early stage to regularise their status. The tax act imposes a tax on an application for a visa made by an unlawful non-citizen who has been unlawfully present in Australia for a period or periods adding up to at least 12 months. The minimum amount of tax imposed is $3,000 a year for each year that the person has been unlawful at the time of the application for a visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department and the minister claim that it has subsequently become apparent since the introduction of the act which, as I say, only took effect from 1 September 1994, that this intention may not have been achieved through the act and that in some cases the tax may even act as a deterrent to illegals coming forward. I would have thought that that was blindingly obvious to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the explanatory memorandum to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995 it was stated that this objective was better achieved through other legislative and procedural mechanisms. So the bill seeks to repeal the tax act and if any tax has already been collected it will be refunded to the taxpayer, but the advice I have received is that no-one has as yet paid the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose this provision. However, I think it is yet another example of legislative incompetence by the minister and by his department. The act has only been operating since 1 September 1994. The bill that we are now debating came into the House of Representatives in March of this year, so within a period of six months or less the government decided that the act is inappropriate and needed repealing. If such a short period was required to make that judgment, then there was obviously something wrong with the whole process in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the fifth element of the bill before us is amendments to the Immigration (Education) Act 1971. Due to what is described as an unintended oversight, certain visa classes created on 1 November 1993 may have been given a statutory entitlement to 510 hours of free English language tuition. The bill intends to remove this entitlement prospectively upon enactment. However, I understand approximately 100 people have already accessed such classes and will have such access revoked but not be required to refund the cost of the course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government states that this was an unintentional oversight. That may well be the case. However, it is difficult to understand why the applicants under the 818 or 816 categories needed English training at all, given that one of the requirements for the granting of an 818 or 816 visa was the passing of an English test. So, whilst we do not disagree with the proposal, again it does seem an act of incompetence on the part of the department and the minister that this is necessary at all. It also raises the question of the appropriateness of the entry criteria which have been required of some of the special visa groups, in particular 816 and 818. Having said those things, I reiterate that the coalition will be supporting the bill before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995. The bill has a number of purposes. One of the main ones is to allow the release from detention of people whose migration status has not been promptly dealt with. The bill will amend the Migration Act 1958 to enable a person who has been held in detention for more than six months following a visa application to be declared, at the minister's discretion, an `eligible non-citizen' so that he or she may be released from detention. I note that the WA Greens intend to move an amendment to reverse that onus, to in fact make the release automatic unless the minister objects to it as a matter of public interest. I believe that approach has a lot of merit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also limits the circumstances in which people will be entitled to free English language tuition. It seeks to amend the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 to make it clear that the Commonwealth is not obliged to provide such tuition to certain visa applicants who already enjoy a high proficiency in the English language. I would put on record the Australian Democrats' view that this is eminently sensible but, if that in any way provides some resources which would otherwise have been used in this area, then there seems to me a good case for increasing the number of hours of tuition being provided to people who have not got that particular proficiency. The Australian Democrats certainly believe that recent restrictions that have been introduced in this area are ill advised, and we would call on the government to increase the provision of English language tuition and reduce the cost to people who have not got the proficiency in the language. </PARA>

<PARA>All these amendments relate to the central principle of the  determination that a person is an `eligible non-citizen'. This relates back to the recommendations of the committee to which Senator Short referred earlier. As Senator Short and the chairman would be aware, at the time the decision was made that there would be mandatory detention for non-citizens who were not considered to be eligible for bridging visas I made very clear in a dissenting report that I considered that the mandatory period of six months was far too long and that it should be a much shorter period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular change that has been made in this bill is that, after that six-month period has expired, the minister should have the discretion to be able to make that person into an eligible non-citizen, that is, a person who may be able to make an application for a protection visa. The purpose of the amendments already foreshadowed by Senator Spindler is to reverse the onus or burden of proof of that. We are asking the minister to make that determination in cases where he thinks the person should not have release and to have the principle of automatic release for everybody else after that six months. I have not got any illusions about the degree of support that change can expect in this chamber, but I would be very encouraged if it did receive more support than I understand it will gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, what I am saying on behalf of the Greens is we understand that there are some reasons for detaining people who arrive as asylum seekers and refugees on our shores, to make certain of their identity and to look at certain health and quarantine matters. The fact that we are imprisoning&mdash;by our detention&mdash;young children, elderly people and people who may be in need of medical care, and putting them in situations that may well be replicating the situations of torture and trauma that they have experienced and from which they are fleeing, is something that we in Australia should be very concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of six months of that is, in my view, intolerable. I am ambivalent about even supporting this bill with that capacity. However, I am forced to do that as the minister should be able in some situations to make sure, in the public interest, that people are not released. What I am wholeheartedly hoping for is that those who are no threat whatsoever in the community and who are in the process of being assessed for their refugee status should certainly be released into the community to those community agencies that have expressed the view that they would be glad to support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the thrust of this amendment is that, unless the minister thinks that a release would be contrary to the public interest, that release would be an automatic one. I am glad that Senator Spindler in his speech in the second reading debate foreshadowed some support for that notion. I would urge that this chamber consider it, look even further at what Australia is doing by its mandatory detention for such a long period as six months and support the use of a bridging visa, not only for humane reasons, but also for the practical ones which seem to carry more sway in this day and age with both the government and the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such reasons would include the economics of keeping people in detention when there are community resources available to assist them at far less cost. They could stay in a place where they could actually be nurtured and supported, where they could look at their future and even cope with negative decisions, if necessary. They would also be prepared in a better way than by simply moving from one difficult situation, one of fleeing their home country, to another, detention and maybe even return.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are of the view that the government should choose a different option from the detention option that it is currently pursuing with such vigour. We believe that people seeking asylum should be released into the care of responsible community organisations, mostly church based organisations, which are prepared to accept responsibility for these people and which can assist them in their quest to stay in Australia and, more particularly, to overcome the trauma that clearly they have suffered in fleeing their country of origin and seeking asylum in Australia. It would be a much more humane policy to follow. While there may be some isolated exceptions to that rule, it is a rule that I believe Australian citizens would want our government to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These amendments moved by Senator Chamarette go some way towards that by putting a limit on the detention that the government is implementing. I think it is eminently sensible for the government to allow people, after six months detention, to be released into the care of responsible community organisations and to stop that only if there are public interest considerations which would militate against that course of action. For that reason, the Democrats will be supporting the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) needs to explain to the committee why the amendments moved by Senator Chamarette should not be accepted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The refugee convention imposes an obligation on this country, and every other signatory country, to give protection to those persons who have a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. It is to be determined whether that is a well-founded fear. But we have people coming to the country, asylum seekers, many of whom have gone through enormous sufferings to get here. And what happens to them? They are locked up in detention centres up on the isolated north-west coast of this continent, far from any possibility of their communicating in their own language with people who may be sympathetic towards them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not criticising in any way the officers of the department. That is not the point. The point of these amendments is that if there is to be detention&mdash;and, as has been expressed around the chamber thus far, this is a second-best alternative to those people being cared for by certain community groups or released to certain community groups who would be responsible for them whilst their application is being heard&mdash;and the period of detention is for a period of more than six months, the detainee should then be released into the custody of community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been indicated&mdash;and we have all heard from those organisations&mdash;they are prepared to assist. They are prepared to give succour to the people until such time as those asylum seekers are determined to have a well-founded fear of persecution on any one of those five grounds. That, as has been indicated by Senator Chamarette, should appeal to the government's and the opposition's economic sensibilities, and, indeed, to all of our sensibilities, when it comes to taxpayers' money. It will save taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to the minister. If the minister thinks this determination would be contrary to the public interest, then these amendments proposed by Senator Chamarette will enable the minister to make a determination and have it tabled in the parliament to set out why the determination has been made and to set out the minister's reasons for thinking that the determination would be contrary to the public interest&mdash;that is, to say the release into custody would be contrary to the public interest. I think this is an eminently reasonable proposal that has been put forward. I would like to hear what the minister has to say, but it certainly appeals to me. </PARA>

It was also given the task of discovering whether we are really in breach of our international commitments by actually detaining people in a prison-like setting when they could be found to be refugees who have fled their countries for very justified reasons and who have already experienced torture and trauma and therefore deserve asylum rather than be subjected to a repeat of that trauma.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the minister that, even though the report made the recommendation for a six-month mandatory detention period, there was a clear understanding that that was to be the maximum period. If it was to extend beyond that&mdash;and that would be the fault of the department&mdash;it was clearly undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my point of view, even though the minister stated that this bill deals with the recommendations of that committee, it was not necessarily part of that recommendation that the six-month mandatory detention period be a minimum amount which can be automatically extended. It was clearly the reverse&mdash;that more than six months was undesirable. What we are debating here is the mechanism by which we determine that period. That is the point the amendment is addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really very important that the people who are still in detention are the responsibility of the minister. He should be aware of those who have stayed in detention for more than six months and he should not just be able to assume that the whole of the detention is valid no matter how long it lasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to ask the minister a question and then complete my comments after foreshadowing it. How many of the people who are in detention at the present moment have been there for longer than six months? It is very important that this parliament be aware of that fact and know the kinds of numbers about which we are speaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention that the quality of care in detention centres in Australia is not an issue here. Far be it from me to criticise the attempts that all the people who have been involved in this difficult problem have endeavoured to bring to that situation. It is not a question that there is any criticism implied here about the quality of care, but neither is it the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have visited a Hong Kong detention centre and seen the conditions there. I have visited Port Hedland on two occasions&mdash;once in the early days when there were some difficulties in the regime there and people were suffering quite considerably from them and again when people were much happier with the way in which the whole program was being administered. I have no complaints whatsoever about that. However, it was very noticeable when I went back and the conditions were improved that the psychological distress of the people under detention was actually worse than it was when the conditions were bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the change, in a way, is that not having enough cutlery or crockery, it being very hot or having difficult situations with supervision, et cetera, distracted people from their own internal distress as to what they were going through. When they received very fair and good handling, the real distress from which they were suffering was more apparent to the rest of us. We could see that the pure psychological impact of detention on people who have already come here in a distressed situation was what we should be concerned about as well as the humanitarian impact of detention on those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would disassociate myself from any criticisms of what is being done. I am critical of the fact that this parliament is in a position to say to people, `Anything more than six months is undesirable, and if that period comes around it should be possible for a bridging visa to be given.' The purpose of this amendment is really to put the onus of that onto the minister so that if there is anyone who, for public interest reasons, should not be released, it is in his hands and he will know that person.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we can be sure that we are not contributing to an out-of-sight out-of-mind situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each person who has been held in detention for more than six months will be somebody of whom the minister is aware because he will have actually laid before each house of parliament a statement as to why a determination has not been made to release them into the community's care and support which would help them to adjust to whatever the decision may be. The statement will set out the minister's reasons for the determination and for the public interest aspects involved in it. That will prevent us from escaping our responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also, I believe, fulfil the spirit of the recommendation of the committee. While it decided that six months was an appropriate period of time&mdash;and I have already said that I was not happy that it was such a long period of time&mdash;in my recollection of what took place there was an understanding that anything longer than six months was inappropriate. By reversing this, we will know who has been in there for longer than six months so it can be brought before this parliament and assessed. That will mean that nobody will be overlooked, there will not be any oversight, and we will actually be carrying out our responsibilities as an international citizen in relation to refugees and asylum seekers in a far better and more responsible fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I ask the minister: how many people are we talking about here? Why is it that we cannot actually allow the bridging visa to be an automatic measure after six months, with those who are not eligible to be clearly notified to the parliament and for the minister to have the capacity to make the determination and give us the reasons for it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 [No. 2] makes certain amendments to the Migration Act retrospective to 1 November 1989 in an attempt to ensure that certain provisions of the act are consistent with what the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, and his department claim are their previously understood effect. This bill has been re-presented to the Senate after its defeat in this place on 9 November 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned on behalf of the coalition when the bill was debated last year, the bill is an attempt to deal with an issue that has plagued successive immigration ministers in this government. I stress the point that it is a problem entirely of the government's own making. It is only due to the fact that this incompetent government, and this incompetent minister, cannot get its legislation right that we have to keep revisiting issues such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition has recognised the government's dilemma and, at all times, has attempted to take a principled and responsible stance to its consideration of and its responsibilities in these matters. Our stance on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), this second time, continues in that vein. Although we will not oppose the passage of this bill on this second occasion, we will criticise and, where appropriate, seek to defeat or amend any legislation which we consider to be significantly or fundamentally flawed. Under this government we have seen this to an unprecedented degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the defining characteristics of Senator Bolkus's administration of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs&mdash;indeed, it goes back to the latter part of the administration by his predecessor, Mr Gerry Hand&mdash;has been his legislative incompetence. The saga of this bill is only one of many examples. It is staggering to note that there has been an average of five bills in each of the years of Senator Bolkus's administration of the portfolio which seek, in some way, to amend the Migration Act; that is, almost one bill for each month of sitting days that the minister has been in charge of this portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, the implementation of the Migration Reform Act&mdash;major changes to the whole of the migration system&mdash;was deferred for a period of almost two years because of difficulties that the government had in really getting its act together to achieve what it was trying to do legislatively. Even though the reform act's implementation was deferred for two years until September 1994, even with that extra time the department still could not provide the regulations to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in advance of their release as, I think I can accurately say, had earlier been promised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there have been a large number of bills introduced by this government which have had to be amended by the Senate at the instigation of the coalition to ensure that they actually fulfil their stated purpose. Fourthly, we have seen the constant problem that the government has with its legislation being challenged in the courts. There are numerous examples of this. The bill now before the Senate is, by the Government Solicitor's own admission, likely to be challenged&mdash;in fact, almost certainly to be challenged&mdash;and quite possibly overturned by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the High Court decision to dismiss an appeal by the minister for immigration against an adverse decision by the Federal Court over the interpretation of the department's own 273-day maximum period of detention for boat people. We also saw the government's difficulties over the definition of `refugee' and China's one-child policy. The minister's handling of that issue was all over the place from the start. Initially, in December 1994, he claimed that he was going to introduce urgent legislation to deal with the matter. However, the legislation he introduced was so poorly drafted that most witnesses appearing before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looking into the bill believed that, if enacted, the legislation would fail its stated purpose. They are just some of the examples of the incompetence that we have now come to recognise as flowing from this minister and from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The events which have led to the creation of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3)&mdash;the bill now before the Senate&mdash;and the background to that bill are relevant to this debate. This aspect of the bill applies only to illegal border arrivals or boat people who were detained between November 1989 and May 1992. They were detained illegally, but according to the government this illegal detention was caused by a technical fault. The government's first attempt to solve the problem by limiting damages payable to those illegally detained to $1 per day of illegal detention was subject to constitutional challenge. The majority of opinion suggested that such a challenge would be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been plagued by such `technical' faults&mdash;to use its word&mdash;in the whole area of immigration law for a long time now. It is a matter of great concern that the government is continuing to run into these problems. It must say something about the method of preparation of proposals within the department, particularly the drafting of legislation. I think it is fortunate that the Senate is diligent in its examination of legislation to ensure that more mistakes do not get through the system than is now the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Detention policy and the onshore processing of asylum seekers alone have been plagued with costly technical errors. As I mentioned previously, the government was defeated last year on what has become known as the 273-day case. In that case the department misinterpreted the amount of time that this legislation allowed for lawful detention of illegal immigrants. That was compounded by the fact that it occurred after the commencement of the Migration Reform Act&mdash;an act which was meant to make Australia's detention policy much more watertight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in late 1994 the government's previous inaction and its blurred and inconsistent signals contributed very significantly to the arrival of hundreds of Sino-Vietnamese boat people who believed that, because they were getting such mixed signals from the government, one way or another they would be accepted in Australia for merely seeking a better life. The government had ample time to address that problem, yet either through incompetence or neglect it waited for the problem to escalate and to stretch to breaking point before any action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the incompetent two-year delay in the implementation of the Migration Reform Act. Today we are dealing with yet another immigration portfolio disaster. By detaining some 450 illegal boat people without proper legal authority, the Keating government has potentially made the Australian taxpayer liable to a compensation bill of up to tens of millions of dollars. When this bill is passed, as I think it will be, it still appears likely to be subject to successful High Court challenge, if you can believe the government's own legal advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this point, the government has refused to pursue any avenues other than the legislative one, to solve its problem. Until now, the minister has claimed that section 54RA, the clause implemented by Migration Amendment Act (No. 4) 1992 which limits any compensation payable to $1 per day, has restricted them from entering into an out of court settlement with the plaintiffs. With the passage of this bill, that section will be removed, thus removing the impediment to settlement. I believe that is an avenue which the government should consider pursuing. An out of court settlement may indeed be the best way to address this issue and to save taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's original opposition to this bill was a protest against a bad legislative response by the government. The bill, at the time of its introduction 10 months ago, was claimed to be most urgent. The bill actually stemmed from another bill&mdash;namely, Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994&mdash;which was introduced more than a year ago and which was withdrawn and replaced by bill No. 3 for purely political reasons. That further delayed the consideration of what the government was trying to claim was urgent. This bill was originally defeated in November last year. The government has failed to have it debated until this late stage, despite its so-called urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is yet another example of the Keating government's inability to manage its Senate program. It is an indictment of Senator Bolkus, who has failed to ensure that this and several other migration bills are debated within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's original decision to vote against the bill in November 1994 was made, on balance, because of its retrospectivity. As I have already mentioned, the bill had been introduced in an attempt to cover past policy and administrative failures by the Labor government. At the time, however, we were conscious&mdash;and said so&mdash;of other considerations, particularly the potential cost to the public purse if the bill were defeated, and the community concern about paying compensation to people who arrived in Australia illegally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since taking that original decision, we have all been made aware of growing community concern about what many people in the community perceive, rightly or wrongly, as rewarding illegal immigrants with compensation. We have also been made aware of increasing community concern generally in respect of arrivals by boat in recent times, many of whom do not prima facie appear to be genuine refugees. Although the recent arrivals of boat people have nothing to do with this bill, they have served to highlight strong community concerns about the integrity of our national borders and Australia's right to decide who can and cannot enter Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding, on balance, not to vote against the bill on this second occasion, we have taken account of the clearly expressed community views, particularly at this time when we are calling on the government to do much more to contain its expenditures. The government has its budget in one almighty mess. It is the single most significant problem facing the economic management of this country. It is incumbent on the government to do all that it can to reduce the horrendous budget deficit of more than $8 billion that it is inflicting on the Australian community this year. It is a budget that looks like blowing out still further as the year progresses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, having said all that, we remain strongly concerned about the retrospectivity contained in this bill. We stressed and expressed that strong concern on the previous occasion when the bill was debated. I want to place that on the record. The strength of that concern as expressed on that previous occasion should be noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition will not vote against the bill this time, I want to make it absolutely clear that we remain highly critical of the Keating government&mdash;and this Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in particular&mdash;for the legislative incompetence surrounding this whole issue of unlawful detention. I remind the Senate that it is through the Keating government's mishandling of Australia's immigration detention regime that it has exposed Australian taxpayers to the possibility of millions of dollars in compensation payouts. I repeat, in conclusion on this section of the bill, the hope that the government may now consider and work towards an out of court settlement on this matter. There is no technical reason, once this bill has passed, why that should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also proposes to amend the Migration Act so as to stop the use of repeat applications for protection visas by non-citizens to delay their removal from Australia. The bill will effectively stop a person from making a repeat onshore application for the same protection visa whilst in Australia. The minister will, however, have the power to exercise non-compellable discretion in favour of allowing a particular individual to lodge a repeat application if he thinks it is in the public interest. This component of the current bill is a recent addition. It was originally attached to the government's ill-fated Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, which I understand has now essentially been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing the repeat application clause. We accept the arguments that have been put for it. We stated our support at the time, and that support has not changed. We are of the belief that applicants who have been unsuccessful in their applications for protection visas should abide by the umpire's decision and depart. We do not support the unlimited access to our onshore protection visa processing facilities. Such unfettered access would be a misuse of a very important and expensive program. We believe all applicants should be processed in accordance with the act and regulations, and any abuse of those regulations should be dealt with firmly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs public hearings on the original bill, several groups expressed concern that this will only lead to the limiting of access to Australia's processing system to applicants with genuine concerns. In such cases the minister has the ability to grant consent to repeat applications if he believes it to be in the public interest. We in the coalition believe that this is an adequate safety net to ensure that those applicants whose situations clearly change or who have fresh evidence may lodge a fresh claim. However, it would be reassuring to have the minister state in this place what he sees the relevant criteria for the initiation of these powers to be. On that voiceless note, I think I might cease. Thank you. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has happened since this bill was debated previously in this chamber is that parliamentarians, from my state in particular, have felt a white heat from the electorate. When the opposition previously decided to oppose the earlier bill and allow for the possibility of a windfall gain to a large number of illegal migrants to this country it truly had sections of the population up in arms. I certainly felt the heat of it. I did not feel it as warmly as those colleagues of mine on the opposition benches because I supported the original bill. They rejected it, and in so doing left open the possibility of a $96 million windfall gain&mdash;and that is not a government estimate; that is an estimate made by one of the very vocal advocates of boat people in this country, Dr Mary Crock. She made that estimate in the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee. </PARA>

I am not going to repeat that. The magnanimity of this very important event that we will be witnessing here this afternoon hopefully when the bill is passed&mdash;which undoubtedly it will be with the weight of numbers in the chamber&mdash;tells me that we should all be good together, that we are today acting in the best interests of the electorate and of the community by blocking this possible windfall gain to people who did not have a right to be here in the first place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to bring to the Senate's attention the dilemma that some of my constituents in Western Australia find themselves in. Indeed, it is more than just a dilemma, it is a dire situation. This has its origins in the investment by a number of people in Western Australia in two schemes involving Century Insurance Ltd and Mineral Sands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of 1990 and 1991, approximately 65 investors in that state invested a total of $3.5 million in those two schemes, via Quentin Ward Investment Services. This matter has been the subject of some attention by the press; but I believe that this matter should not slip away unnoticed and that it behoves me, as a senator for Western Australia, to put to the Senate the plight that these people find themselves in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of these investors are elderly and they were investing funds to accommodate their retirement. It does not necessitate any explanation to convey the concern and anxiety that such a loss would cause people in that position. The investors I mentioned were introduced to these schemes by Mr Quentin Ward. As I understand it, he was a financial consultant who was known in the areas of the Avon Valley, Northam and Beverley, and the environs thereabouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investment money in this instance was under direction in Australia to be placed with the CMI medical group&mdash;the Clerical Medical Investment Group&mdash;which is a large and respectable insurance company in the United Kingdom. This investment money did not reach its destination and, in fact, Century Insurance Ltd&mdash;the company I mentioned&mdash;proved to be a $1 company set up by a Mr Donald Davies in the Cook Islands. A number of complaints were made by the people concerned to the Australian Securities Commission in 1991 and 1992 when the fraud was realised. These complaints did not result in any action. Some 50 of these investors combined to form a group&mdash;the Quentin Ward Investors Action Group. As such, they instructed corporate investigators and asset recovery specialist group McLernon Group Ltd to carry out investigations on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These investigations revealed that between 28 March 1990 and 5 November 1990, $2.1 million worth of funds were transferred from trust accounts under the control of Quentin Ward to trust accounts of, firstly, the New Zealand Guardian Trust Co. Ltd and, later, its wholly owned subsidiary NZI International Trustee Co. Ltd. Both accounts operated from a Sydney bank. The moneys were not disbursed as directed to the Clerical Medical Investment Group but, instead, were invested as follows: $1.2 million to either Don Davies or companies controlled by him; $669,000 to pay out 50 lapsed insurance policies with the CMI Investment Group; and $200,000, being the balance, paid to professional appointees of Don Davies, including an accountant in Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the CMI Investment Group&mdash;and you should remember that that was the group that these investors had directed should be the recipient of funds for the purposes of investment&mdash;had never at any stage had a business relationship with Century Insurance Ltd or Don Davies. Moreover, they had not given any authority for their name to be used in any brochures advertising for potential investment. That is crucial because it shows that the CMI Investment Group were not aware of this aspect of the investment which was going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McLernon Group Ltd has now compiled two detailed reports which have concluded that some of the foreign companies who acted for and advised Century Insurance Ltd in Australia were not registered to do business in this country. Both of these detailed reports have been provided to the Australian Securities Commission, who advised in April 1995 that the matter would be handled by its Brisbane office. When the McLernon Group contacted the Brisbane office on 17 July 1995, that office declined to act and suggested that the complaint be dealt with by the Western Australian office of the ASC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that a meeting between the ASC and the McLernon Group took place on 25 August 1995. That was a meeting set up at the invitation of the ASC. I am further advised that the Quentin Ward Investors Action Group wanted, and still wants, the ASC to investigate both New Zealand companies I mentioned for unlawfully doing business in Australia, contrary to the companies code; to investigate Century Insurance Ltd for unlawfully doing business in Australia; and to investigate the conduct of Don Davies in relation to Century Insurance, with particular reference to him holding himself out to be a director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the McLernon Group that, notwithstanding the merit of the complaint, it was advised that, due to the ASC's policy position and lack of resources, the matter would not be investigated. It has also been put forward that, as this matter is the subject of investigation by the Queensland fraud squad, it is better left to the Queensland police to investigate. As I understand it, the investigation in Queensland does not pertain to the matters that I raise today and relates to other activities of Mr Davies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do understand that the Quentin Ward Investors Action Group did make a complaint in December 1994 to the Queensland police, and that has resulted in this action. What is being sought is action by the ASC, because what we have here are the actions of two New Zealand companies operating out of Sydney, and Century Insurance, a company doing business in Australia, albeit it was registered in the Cook Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say that I am at a loss as to why the ASC will not take this matter any further&mdash;a matter which was first complained of some four years ago. Therefore, I call upon the minister representing the Attorney-General in the Senate: firstly, to either deny or confirm the merit of the complaints made by the Quentin Ward Investors Action Group; and, secondly, to confirm whether these complaints cannot be investigated due to government policy or lack of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is the case that this matter cannot be investigated due to government policy, I call upon the government to tell the Senate, to tell the investors involved, what that policy is. I call upon the government to tell the Senate what the criteria is that is used in these instances. Which complaints are dealt with? Which complaints are not dealt with? Is there some sort of general policy that the government has put in place and which the ASC has to abide by?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as lack of resources is concerned, I would put it to the Senate that the government has to account to the people of Australia as to why it will not resource such an important area of law enforcement. We have here some 65 people who have lost $2.1 million, which they can ill afford to lose&mdash;money which was intended, in the main, for their retirement&mdash;and we have no action on behalf of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore call upon the Minister representing the Attorney-General in the Senate to give this his urgent attention and I call upon him to answer the questions that I have put. These questions certainly require answers if not for the community at large then formthe 65 Australians I have mentioned who have lost the money concerned&mdash;money, as I said, which was important for their retirement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Northern Territory)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (12.55 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity of the matters of public importance debate today to address the important issue of the implications of statehood for the Northern Territory and point out where a recent visit by a senior Australian Labor Party official to the Northern Territory, in fact the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, got it horribly wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Usually, before a minister visits a particular electorate, he receives a brief from his own department on the issues that ought to very properly apply and that will arise in the course of that visit. On the occasion of Mr Beazley's visit this month to the Northern Territory he obviously did not read a departmental brief. In fact, we must question very seriously where he got his information. Mr Beazley got it horribly wrong. I must call into question, therefore, his credibility, particularly on telling the truth, and question whether that is a matter like the debate that has proceeded here in this parliament over the last week or so about Dr Carmen Lawrence, or whether it is about the Northern Territory's funding. It is very obvious that Mr Beazley is taking a lot of licence in not being very deliberative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking to Fred McHugh, a senior journalist with the ABC, in Darwin on 17 August, Mr Beazley said two things about statehood that either foreshadow a drastic and dramatic change in established funding arrangements for the Northern Territory, or they indicate that he is getting very poor advice. Let me quote from that particular interview. Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think I'd be very concerned in pressure for statehood that I wasn't moving too far ahead of Commonwealth commitment of resources. I think it would be unavoidable that were statehood to be achieved then there would be a consequence. You could not sit down with the other states and justify the level of subsidy in per capita here if statehood had actually been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote indicates two issues that need to be addressed: firstly, that the Northern Territory could not justify the level of per capita subsidy should statehood be achieved. This is nonsense since there is absolutely no connection between the two matters. The Northern Territory receives a higher level of federal funding not because of its constitutional status but simply because of territory and remote disabilities such as distance, disbursement of population, the high Aboriginal population and similar factors. Not one of these factors will be changed in the slightest by the grant of statehood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Australian Labor Party would start treating us territorians like another state financially and that would produce a very substantial reduction in federal resources. Let me quote Mr Beazley again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'd be careful about getting into a position where a finance minister like myself could sit down, and my successors as the years go by could sit down and say, `That's pretty cool, now we'll start treating them like another state.' That would produce a very substantial reduction in federal resources.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where Mr Beazley has been for the past seven years, but the Northern Territory has been treated like a state since 1988 when we were included in the pool of financial assistance grants. It is true that, much like the states, as a territory we have suffered continuing cuts from the Commonwealth over that period. But becoming a state will have no bearing whatsoever on whether such unjustified funding cuts continue. As territorians, we have just about given up on the Northern Territory's federal member, the quisling Mr Snowdon, who never acts or talks like a territorian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Teague)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! It is not parliamentary to refer to a member of the other chamber, or of this chamber, as a quisling. I ask Senator Tambling to withdraw that. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the comment, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. We certainly have no confidence whatsoever in Mr Snowdon as a federal member. He never acts or talks like a territorian when funding or statehood matters come up. In fact, he said recently, on 9 June:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of proceeding towards statehood for the Northern Territory is incidental to the process for getting to a republic and that's been made very clear.</PARA>
<PARA>It is altogether too much when the Deputy Prime Minister continues that line of drivel about statehood. Obviously, he took his brief on that particular day from Mr Snowdon and not from his own Department of Finance. Territorians can only hope that Mr Beazley will come back to Canberra to get briefed by his Department of Finance about the facts of Northern Territory funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was raised in the Northern Territory parliament on the same day as the radio broadcast. A question was asked of the Minister for Constitutional Development in the Northern Territory, Mr Steve Hatton, and I take the opportunity to quote from Mr Hatton's response on that occasion. Mr Hatton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . funding for the Northern Territory, under the Commonwealth/State tax-sharing arrangements, are now on the same formula base as that used in relation to every state in Australia. It is correct that we receive higher per capita funding, and as we all know in this House, or should know, that is because it costs a great deal more to deliver the same standard of service in many of the rural and remote, scattered communities of the Northern Territory, which is what the Grants Commission assesses. We are assessed for assistance under the same formula as every state in this country and, since 1988, the funding comes from the Commonwealth/State tax-sharing pool, not from a separate allocation of funding as is used in the early days. There are no differences in those financial relationships between us and the states.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hatton went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What amazes me is that somehow Mr Beazley . . . obviously does not understand that, which is a matter of some concern in a minister in the federal government or, if he does, he is deliberately lying and scaremongering in the Northern Territory. Either way, it is totally unacceptable to suggest in any way that there are any financial constraints to statehood.</PARA>
<PARA>I can only reiterate Mr Hatton's opinions, and I am concerned that Mr Beazley is revisiting the ALP scare tactics in the late 1970s before self-government was achieved for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, is most unfortunate and unnecessary. It is very much going to the issue that this parliament has been addressing in considerable detail this week about truth: in parliament, out of parliament, in the media and anywhere else, for that particular instance. The statements by Mr Beazley on this occasion give us a great deal of concern. Mr Beazley will quickly find that there is absolutely no connection with the statehood question and the funding question which he has raised by misusing the truth and getting off the proper bandwagon. I hope that he will set the record straight. </PARA>

I refer to the unfortunate circumstances caused by cystic fibrosis, and the fact that tomorrow the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is reconsidering its earlier decision to give controlled listing of pulmozyme in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This particular drug has shown, in some cases, that it has great potential in reducing the effects of cystic fibrosis, a very debilitating affliction, on young people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this particular matter is going to be reconsidered by the PBAC tomorrow. I would like to quote from a few articles that have appeared in our local paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS>, where their health reporter, Mary Rose, has brought this to the attention of not just the public of Tasmania but to a lot of politicians. I was contacted by concerned general practitioners, namely, Dr Derek Mitchell, Dr John Saul and Tim Jackson from Lauderdale and Lindisfarne respectively and I have received many letters from constituents concerning the affordability of this drug. Yesterday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS> I read an article which reminded me of a family's desperate plea earlier this year for access to this new drug. Verne and Clarence McCauley from Risdon Vale spoke out about their family's predicament in not being able to afford this particular drug.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The selling of Australian icons overseas has become a matter of concern, I think, for many Australians. The fact that even iced vo vos are now foreign owned worries a lot of Australians, and vegemite has been owned by an overseas company for many years. But the rush on Australian icons by overseas interests has really only arisen during the years of this so-called nationalistic Australian government, an Australian government that is so nationalistic that it wants to change the flag, change the constitution, make Australia more Australian and all the while it is busily selling off the farm or, should I say, the piggery. That is the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have this Australian government standing over a situation where not only are more and more of Australia's icons being sold overseas but, according to the latest figures, Australia is going into bigger and bigger debt in order to pay for this government's incompetent economic policies. It is the terrible thing: not only are we selling many Australian icons but we are also now massively in debt. The great bulk of our food industry is now owned overseas, and massive proportions of our mineral and oil industries&mdash;the areas of greatest potential growth in Australia&mdash;also appear to be dominated by overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, we have not sold off enough of the farm to pay our bills. We keep having to borrow more and more, as I think today's figures of our foreign debt show. As Senator Calvert says, we are having to pay interest on the interest. In fact, the interest bill alone is now about $1,000 million a month net. This is a disaster.

Not only is he encouraged by his economic policies of selling off the farm, he himself is selling out to make a quid&mdash;to make a quick quid while the shareholders of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which still includes the Australian public as well as direct shareholders, have suffered a substantial loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am raising this is that there are many matters of concern that emerge out of the total sale now of the Keating piggery&mdash;which was to have been a joint venture with Danish interests&mdash;to overseas interests at huge profit to Mr Keating. We know that this sale was from Mr Keating, via an intermediary, to foreign interests. I gave notice this morning that I intended to move tomorrow a motion in relation to this, because of the way an intermediary was used to hide the fact that Mr Keating was selling out to foreign interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating owned half of this piggery group. He told the parliament he was selling to his partner, when the documents we have now seen, which have been filed in various courts, clearly show that, three days before Mr Keating made that sale, an agreement was reached with the Indonesian interests involving the sale of Mr Keating's half interest. Mr Keating must have known of that agreement before he sold. Here we have a situation where because, I presume, he did not like the political consequences, firstly, of his being involved in `selling out the farm'&mdash;apart from having encouraged it from many Australians&mdash;he did not want to be seen to be selling out the piggery to foreigners. Also he did not want to be seen to be in the position where he really was: in a potential for conflict of interest where he stood to gain from a decision by the Foreign Investment Review Board and his own Treasurer (Mr Willis), to whom the Foreign Investment Review Board reports. He did not want to be seen to be in a position to be gaining from such a decision by his own government and so he interposed this intermediary, with the result that if it were not for my investigations the Australian public would not know that Mr Keating has received a substantial benefit from a decision by one of his own government's bodies, the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying whether it is right or wrong that the FIRB should have approved this sale. My view is that it would probably have been quite wrong for the FIRB not to have allowed such a sale, because after all it is allowing everyone else to sell out. It is allowing the disposal, if you like, of so many Australian icons that you wonder what useful purpose it does actually serve. But it does raise questions about why the Prime Minister, who is supposed to be leading our country with propriety but who has a curious approach to the truth, judging by his role in the Carmen Lawrence affair, should be allowed&mdash;without comment&mdash;to get away with using this facade to avoid the reality, to avoid revealing that he sold out to foreigners for a huge profit, despite the fact that his piggery was suffering substantial losses. These matters I think should be looked at and it is up to the Prime Minister to come clean at last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put these sorts of matters before the Prime Minister repeatedly in this chamber and we never ever get a substantive answer. All we get is that Baume is up there smearing this beautiful, perfect Prime Minister who never does anything wrong. Talk about St Carmen; we have St Paul now. The ludicrous thing is that he is prepared to hide behind this facade and, if anyone dares to suggest that it might be a good idea if he tells the truth, that person is personally smeared&mdash;as I have been&mdash;as being a person of no repute, telling lies about him, and so on. All I ask the Prime Minister to do is to come clean and to answer these substantive matters. There is one very serious substantive matter in particular and that is the question of what happened to the $20 million the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was owed by the piggery group while Mr Keating was its half-owner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know from court documents that the group owed something like $13 million last year after a takeover by Indonesians. We know that this amount is made up of something like $7 1/2 million from one company&mdash;I think it is Hunter Valley Piggeries Pty Ltd&mdash;and another $2 million or so from Darling Downs piggery. I do not know where the rest comes from&mdash;probably from a company called Rincraft, although who knows what has happened to Rincraft, which was the borrowing company for the Brown and Hatton group, because it has disappeared off the face of the earth. There are no proper returns filed for the Brown and Hatton group, the group that Mr Keating half owned. I cannot blame Mr Keating for that because the failure to file the returns took place after he ceased to be a half owner, but the shonky relationships within that group and which resulted in continual breaches of the Corporations Law while Mr Keating was half-owner of the group have continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important about this is that clearly there has been an agreement or a deed or some kind of registered mortgage to take over this debt because, as I said, we now see that the companies which have acquired the assets of the Brown and Hatton group&mdash;that is, Hunter Valley Piggeries Pty Ltd and the Darling Downs piggery under the Euphron structure&mdash;have an arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank resulting in substantial borrowings. The borrowings are at least $7 million for the Hunter Valley piggery, $2 million for the Darling Downs piggery and, presumably, some other amounts from other members of the group, if any. As Mr Constantinidis told the court recently, that gives a total of around $13.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is that there is a letter dated 1 March 1995 from Mr R.E. Griffiths of the Commonwealth Bank to the directors of the Hunter Valley piggery and the Darling Downs piggery noting:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We refer to our letter dated 14 February 1995 regarding interest on the Piggery Joint Venture debt for the month of February payable by 28 February 1995 to CDB and CBA for the total sum of $105,057.54.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The non payment of the above amount constitutes an event of default under Schedule 2 paragraph 3 of the Restructure Deed dated 11 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>This kind of document should be, if it is a registered mortgage, reported by the companies involved. The Senate would not be at all surprised if I reveal that neither Hunter Valley Piggeries Pty Ltd nor the Darling Downs piggery nor, naturally, Euphron have reported such a deed. I cannot check the existence of such a deed with the former companies who owned these activities&mdash;that is, the Brown and Hatton group; there are four or five in that group&mdash;because they have failed to put in their annual returns for the year to 30 June 1994. Surprise, surprise! What is new about that? Just continual breaches of the companies law by Mr Constantinidis who was shown as the director and who, in the past, filed all these accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we do not know whether Mr Constantinidis still owns these companies which he is alleged to have acquired from Mr Keating when he acquired the rest of the interests as a letterbox as part of the transaction when Mr Keating sold out to the Indonesians. A company called Rincraft, another called Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd, another called Brown and Hatton Wholesale, another called Brown and Hatton Rural and another called Belesdan have simply not lodged proper documents with the Australian Securities Commission revealing their latest state of affairs . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the shroud of secrecy behind which this Prime Minister has hidden in his relations with this infamous piggery arrangement continues. I simply hope that the Indonesians who own the piggery group in its entirety&mdash;Indonesian interests through companies registered in Singapore, with directors who appear to be in Hong Kong&mdash;and have now taken over the operations, will behave in a manner which is in total contrast to the improper behaviour of Mr Constantinidis. I note, at no stage has Mr Keating ever criticised or endeavoured to distance himself from the improper activities of Mr Constantinidis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has always simply said, `I'm not in charge of running the thing. Therefore, I can't be blamed for anything that's done.' He has never, ever sought publicly to distance himself from it, to criticise it or to say, `Yes, I admit, that's not proper practice and I would rather it had not gone on.' Instead, Mr Keating has always sought to slander me when all I have been doing is providing details available from the Australian Securities Commission when they are ultimately made available by this reluctant company.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that I wish to raise is the ongoing saga of the National Media Liaison Service. I have been pursuing the question of the National Media Liaison Service for some substantial period of time. In fact, $1.5 million of taxpayers' money has been allocated to it. This service is allegedly a government information service designed to give timely information about government programs. However, as former Prime Minister Hawke's press secretary Barrie Cassidy has clearly indicated on national television, it is a propaganda unit for the government and the Labor Party and it is used for that particular purpose. The shadow minister for administrative services, Senator Rod Kemp, has been pursuing this matter with me now for some considerable period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will recall that, as a result of the vigorous questioning and the exposure of the activities of the National Media Liaison Service, its head, Mr David Epstein, was removed from having the role of overseer of the National Media Liaison Service and was to be only involved in the Ministerial Media Group. Before that, he was responsible for both the Ministerial Media Group and the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that, despite the fact that this Mr Epstein had signed letters indicating that he was both Director of the National Media Liaison Service and Director of the Ministerial Media Group, in front of the Senate committee he denied that he had that dual role. However, the weight of the facts were so overwhelming that, ultimately, the government had to do the right thing and ensure that the National Media Liaison Service and the Ministerial Media Group were separated, housed separately and a separate person appointed to be in charge of the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, people such as Senator Rod Kemp, the shadow minister for administrative services, and I considered that to be a bit of a victory and thought that at least proper standards of government accountability would once again apply to the National Media Liaison Service. It will, of course, be recalled that when the Auditor-General tried to audit the National Media Liaison Service the government set up all its defences so as not to allow the Auditor-General to check up on the activities of the National Media Liaison Service which, of course, from our point of view on this side of the chamber, was an admission of guilt as to the sorts of activities that the National Media Liaison Service engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament has a communications directory, as most senators would be aware. In the February 1995 edition for the autumn sittings, there is an entry on page 127, under communications and facilities branch. Underneath that is listed the National Media Liaison Service with director, adviser, media advisers, secretary, et cetera. These are all listed for all of us to see and make contact with. Since then, of course, there have been the exposures of the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, I had some interest in looking up the spring sittings communications directory to ascertain how the National Media Liaison Service would be described. Under communications and facilities branch, all of a sudden the National Media Liaison Service no longer appears. It is no longer in the index. You can no longer find the National Media Liaison Service in the communications directory. The National Media Liaison Service is supposed to be a master of communications and it cannot even get itself listed in the communications directory. The interesting thing is that, in the place where the National Media Liaison Service used to be listed, we now have the Ministerial Media Group. The Ministerial Media Group is unashamedly a propaganda machine for the ministers and the government. We do not necessarily, on this side of the house, take umbrage at that; that is their role and good luck to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, the government used to say the National Media Liaison Service was distinct from the Ministerial Media Group and that they would not get involved in that sort of tacky politics that the Ministerial Media Group might get involved in. Once we had exposed the National Media Liaison Service for being what it is, they said, `We're going to separate the two and make sure they operate separately.' But, what do they do? They replace or substitute the Ministerial Media Group for the National Media Liaison Service. Under the Ministerial Media Group, the former director of the National Media Liaison Service, Mr Epstein, is listed as the director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adviser in the Ministerial Media Group is Mr Terry Counihan. It is interesting that, when you read the February edition of this communications directory, under the heading of National Media Liaison Service, who is the adviser in the National Media Liaison Service? None other than Mr Terry Counihan. So what have they done in separating these two bodies? They just get the adviser, Mr Terry Counihan, out of the National Media Liaison Service straight into the Ministerial Media Group, exactly continuing the activities that we alleged the National Media Liaison Service were engaged in, but now under the cover of the Ministerial Media Group. We go through this February edition of the communications directory: secretary, Ms Olga Ivancic. We then move to the August edition and, under the Ministerial Media Group, all of a sudden this same lady appears, yet again, under the Ministerial Media Group&mdash;out of the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government really is going from bad to worse in this ongoing saga of the National Media Liaison Service. First of all, it tried to deny that these people were engaged in party political activities. It tried to prevent the auditor looking into its activities. It obfuscated at the Senate estimates committees and this Senate had to pass a special resolution, as you would recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, for a supplementary hearing of Senate estimates into the National Media Liaison Service to require the minister to answer the questions which we, in this Senate, believed were pertinent, were proper and reasonable to be asked. Even then, we had real problems in getting answers and, in fact, we got conflicting answers because the minister and Mr Epstein and Mr Beazley, the minister responsible, all got their stories wrong. It really became a bit of a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Labor Party thought that we might be moving into election mode, about the time that they got rid of the liability Mr Howe, the Deputy Prime Minister, and installed Mr Beazley, they also, at about the same time, got rid of the liability of the National Media Liaison Service, took Mr Epstein out of it, said that it was going to house them separately and treat them separately. From then on, the National Media Liaison Service would be purer than the driven snow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But a little telephone call was made yesterday to the directories people in Parliament House and a simple question was asked, `What is the extension for the Ministerial Media Group?' The answer was 6090. We then asked, `What is the extension for the National Media Liaison Service?' Guess what&mdash;6090. Exactly the same telephone number, yet again! This is the sort of farce that this government believes that we ought to accept, as the people who are responsible for overseeing this $1.5 million that the people of Australia pay towards the National Media Liaison Service. This sort of behaviour by this government is indicative of a government that has become arrogant, a government that thinks it is no longer accountable, that it can do whatever it likes and treat the people and, indeed, this place with distain. It is exactly the same behaviour Senator Baume complained about prior to my speech in relation to the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to his private investments, where the Prime Minister expects a standard of all members of parliament other than himself. For some reason he is somehow different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Media Liaison Service will continue to be an interest of mine and, I am sure, of Senator Kemp and others on the opposition side, until such time as it is run in a fair and proper manner and abides by the terms of reference under which it is supposed to operate, to provide timely information on government projects, and not do the sort of hatchet work that it has engaged in against the opposition over a substantial period of time.

I have to thank many members of the media who have, in fact, made selective leaks to people such as Senator Kemp and me, indicating the underhand activities of the National Media Liaison Service and its operatives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that I raise is an important one because it is a fundamental principle of our democracy that there be no taxation without representation. Increasingly, we are finding in our society today an abrogation of that principle. We have all come to expect that the way taxation is levied&mdash;by imposing taxes on income, which involves bringing to account assessable income, and the allowability of deductions&mdash;is determined by legislation properly passed by the two houses of parliament and approved by the Governor-General. Alternatively, matters of detail as to how it is going to be paid are imposed through regulation. It is mandatory, of course, that those regulations be placed within this parliament within a stipulated time so that they can be disallowed&mdash;a perfectly democratic principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we are increasingly finding that people's opportunity to participate in representation is being taken away, because what the tax office is doing is determining rulings. So, for example, a deduction that was available last year is not available in the current year. I would like to speak briefly to a taxation ruling known as TR95/21 which applies to deductions for the real estate industry. It is quite blatantly saying that a deduction is allowable for expenses incurred by real estate employees before 1 July 1995. So what has been legitimate? Before 1995, a taxpayer could claim, providing he could substantiate the claim with the relevant documentary evidence, those expenditures. However, for the year 1995-96 and later years, those expenses are not deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This appeared a perfectly good law in the past. Suddenly, we have this cut-off and we are told that in the future, without reference to the parliament, by way of a tax ruling that has limited circulation, people in the real estate industry will be denied deductions. I presume that, if this sort of tax ruling is applying to this particular occupational group, there are similar rulings that apply to other occupational groups. It is time the government took heed of what is happening, because it is a very serious issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 1995-96 and later years, these expenditures are not deductible: advertising, club sponsorship, gifts, greeting cards, property presentation and wages. It appears that every employee around Australia is being categorised as if they were a public servant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, public servants do not normally have to employ staff to help them enhance their businesses by keeping records and so on, or by way of letterbox drops, clerical assistance and so on. In the past, if you paid your wages and had the proper group certificates, and it was genuine, not private&mdash;like child minding while you were going out and doing legitimate work&mdash;you could enhance your commissions and claim all those sorts of things. But, as from next year, expenditure on employing people for these sorts of purposes will suddenly be denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand that, if you work within the tax office, your wages are not going to be increased by employing your wife at home or doing letterbox drops, because that is not in the character of that occupation. What we seem to be overlooking is the manner in which people earn their incomes, and the expenses which are necessarily incurred in gaining those incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is up to the tax office to say to a person, `You should not employ staff to enhance your income; you have just got to do that yourself. You have just got to burn the midnight oil, and walk twice as fast to make the appropriate deliveries into letterboxes.' For example, a number of estate agents spend money on mowing the lawns of the houses they have responsibility for selling, so that, when the auction day comes along, the places do look presentable. People will be denied those expenses. I would have thought it would fit within the parameters of section 51 as an expense that is necessarily incurred, because of the nature of the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, we have advertising. We all know that real estate agents have cards printed and circulated around the neighbourhoods for which they have particular responsibility. But, in future, these cards will have to be produced by the employer, not by the employee or the commission agent. Advertising might be a letterbox drop, a signage, bunting and all sorts of razzamatazz. I would have thought that that was perfectly legitimate. But here, by a tax ruling, everybody has been constrained, and you cannot do this and get a tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is absolutely abhorrent. I will certainly be working with the Real Estate Institute to look into this, because I think it is an abrogation of the ordinary principles of democracy. What are we doing here, if laws are being made by the tax office&mdash;beyond our reach&mdash;and the denial of deductions is among them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have greeting cards or introduction cards printed yourself there is no tax deduction. Of course, a deduction is allowable for the cost of attending conferences, seminars and training courses&mdash;I am very pleased to see that that is something that has been retained&mdash;but a greeting card is no longer allowable. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) takes this on board as a matter of principle. I hope that he looks into this and that he reports back to the Senate at the earliest opportunity. This is a principle that, as senators and as a house of review, we cannot allow to go unchallenged.

We cannot always take one month's figures; the critical issue is that we are seeing the longer term trend develop. Our total borrowing from overseas is equal to the gross foreign debt and more than half of that foreign debt is private debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have private corporations in Australia making commercial judgments about the moneys they need to borrow. Some of it is borrowed offshore. These private corporations seek funds either from overseas or the domestic capital market in Australia. The various financial institutions that lend money are doing so on the basis of the financial strength&mdash;the assets, income, profit and loss, and various other financial indicators&mdash;of these various Australian corporations. The government cannot deny private corporations access to capital. I hope that is not what the opposition is suggesting as one of the solutions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the private foreign debt that is owed by Australian companies, these companies use that money from overseas to finance investment projects. Presumably, these projects that investment is occurring in have a rate of return that justifies the repayment of that debt. These private borrowers&mdash;not just companies&mdash;are responsible for paying the interest and the principal on these borrowings. A large part of Australia's foreign debt, around $25 billion, is owed by companies owned by state and Commonwealth governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the case with private companies, these public trading enterprises use their borrowings to finance investment projects that benefit Australia, and there are numerous examples of this. We have electricity corporations that borrow money offshore and this is supported and sustained by the earnings of those corporations. Australian individuals and companies not only borrow from overseas but also lend funds to overseas companies. Taking this lending into account, Australia's net foreign debt is approximately $167 billion. When we talk about billions, it sounds like a lot of money</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but we have got to put it into perspective. The important issue is whether we can sustain the debt and what our debt is comparative to other countries. If you cease interjecting for a few more minutes, you will learn just what our relative debt is and how we can sustain it. What I would emphasis is that 61 per cent of this debt is owed by private companies not by Australian citizens or by governments. It is owed by private companies and corporations. Only a small fraction of this foreign debt, 4 1/2 per cent, is Commonwealth government debt. This reflects the fact that the Australian government has not borrowed money in overseas markets since 1987. We have a very successful record as a government of not borrowing money in overseas capital markets. We have not borrowed a dollar as a government in eight years. That is a remarkable record, particularly in comparison to those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, most of Australia's government foreign debt is state government debt. The state governments have a total foreign debt of $42.5 billion. That is not a consequence of federal government policy. The best way to get a clear understanding of the size of the foreign debt is to compare it to the size of the Australian economy. Since September 1993, the size of the foreign debt relative to the size of the economy has fallen. I wish those opposite could understand the significance of that. It has fallen from 43 per cent to 37 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are much higher than the criteria of impartiality and maintaining the appearance of impartiality that we apply to ordinary affairs of community or employment life. Any analogy based on sex discrimination legislation or comparable things of that kind, which was sought to be called in aid yesterday, comprehensively misses the point. A judge in a court proceedings has always sought to disqualify himself if he is in a family or defacto relationship with a particular person appearing before him or if, in some other way, the nature of the relationship could be seen, whatever the manifest integrity of the participants in the process, to be in issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Vanstone had no difficulty at all in that context about making a series of very fierce points about the need for the appearance of impartiality, of integrity, of propriety to be maintained in processes of this kind, notwithstanding all the issues that might normally be thought to arise in a sex discrimination context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation here where the question of the appearance of a possible less than impartial approach to this is particularly relevant because of the highly politically charged nature of this particular enterprise and moreover the highly political impact of a series of decisions which have been made in recent days about the actual conduct of those royal commission proceedings&mdash;decisions in which counsel assisting have been manifestly closely involved because of the nature of the particular role played by counsel assisting.</PARA>

Of course, it does not. These ministers should be protecting these officials rather than attacking them in this way. They should demonstrate some respect for their reputations rather than seeking to drag their reputations down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this minister does today in refusing to withdraw his accusations and refusing to apologise is not only letting himself down but, in effect, because of his position, letting all senators down and letting the parliamentary institution itself down. That is a particular responsibility and that is why, if he is going to stand by his comments of yesterday, as he has chosen to do today, we have a responsibility to act. Anything short of that would be an abdication of our responsibility in this place. We have a responsibility to demonstrate that we recognise that parliamentary behaviour of his type yesterday is intolerable and, when this occurs, we will so act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that Senator Gareth Evans's attack of yesterday on the professional reputation of these individuals is somewhat out of character. We have always heard from Senator Gareth Evans that what he does is to come in here to stand and protect individual rights, not to attack them under the protection of this chamber. We have here before us someone who on occasions has purported to aspire to judicial office; yet yesterday he came in here and, in this protected environment, sought to attack the integrity of these individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would he do this? Why would he act in a way which would appear to be out of character? The motive, of course, is the political objective.

It might tell us something about whether he would be suited in due course for judicial office. What an example of political opportunism. It is regrettable that he has debased himself in this way. What he has done is reduce himself to the Richardson level where the outcome is what counts, not the method of achieving that outcome.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us take it step by step. The first response of this government to the royal commission was, without hesitation, to use taxpayers' money to seek to close it down by taking it through the courts to try to destroy it. Even when the mass of lawyers said that, on the basis of the Western Australian Supreme Court judgment there was no point in seeking to take it to the High Court, this government did not hesitate to take that extra step&mdash;again at taxpayers' expense&mdash;in order that Dr Lawrence might not have to appear before that royal commission. Of course, it failed. What was found was that the royal commission was legal and legitimate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, what the Prime Minister; Mr Beazley, the Deputy Prime Minister; and Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, sought to do was to communicate that they would disregard its findings no matter what those findings were. The trouble with that&mdash;after they had read the editorials and wised up a little bit&mdash;is that it meant that, in effect, they had to excuse lying. In other words, they will not attack the motive but, if the royal commission came to a finding and they were not prepared to take cognisance of that finding, then they were going to condone lying. So that became a little awkward for this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third step was to try to discredit the commission itself, the lowest possible step the government could take.

I remind you all that questions as to the management and conduct of the commission are the responsibility of the royal commissioner.

The record ought to be put straight for a start as to what exactly I did say yesterday. Let us at least have a clear foundation of recollection about that, not a highly coloured and highly charged one, before we go any further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have a look at page 528 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which contains the relevant passages. First of all, I began by raising the simple question of the appointment to the position in question and by identifying who she was. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it a matter of propriety or is it just a matter of coincidence that the counsel assisting the royal commission, the person whose job it is to recommend to the commission the way in which the evidence is to be prepared, as well as the person whose job it is to write the draft report of the commission, happens to be the sister-in-law of the shadow Attorney-General in this country?</PARA>
<PARA>That was just stating perfectly neutrally what the nature of the problem was. Is this a matter of coincidence or are there issues of propriety raised by that? A little further down, I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Impartiality, as a matter of propriety in Australian public life&mdash;and I am asked a question about propriety&mdash;should not only be present in these kinds of proceedings but also be seen to be present.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the nub and substance of what I was saying yesterday; propriety should not only be present but should be seen to be present. I also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can it be seen to be present when the sister-in-law of the shadow Attorney-General is playing this sort of decisive role and is producing decisions of the kind that we had yesterday to not allow Carmen Lawrence to appear before the commission?</PARA>
<PARA>Then, a little further down again, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . yesterday we had a decision where a request was formally made to bring forward her evidence to respond to the allegations that are being made; and when you make a formal request and it is absolutely denied for no discernible good reason, it is appropriate that these questions be asked.</PARA>
<PARA>What I was doing yesterday&mdash;you will not find any other language that goes further than that&mdash;was drawing attention to this relationship and the appearances generated by that relationship and saying that it is appropriate that questions be asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not confining my statement to that effect to this place, which you describe as the cowards castle. I was asked this morning on radio whether I stand by what I said yesterday. I repeated the nub and substance of it and said it is crucial in proceedings of this kind that not only the existence but also the appearance of impartiality be maintained. That is what is in issue here. That is what I have said publicly. I am perfectly happy to state it publicly outside the door. I have stated it publicly. Check the record. That is the end of the first part of the censure motion, which is that I am not prepared to say outside what I am saying inside. The reason I am prepared to say it outside is that a serious matter of public policy is involved here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standards are high, have to be high and should be high in the conduct of judicial proceedings and quasi-judicial proceedings of the kind that royal commissions quintessentially are. That has always been understood and accepted by those who participate in those proceedings. Questions of family relationship and de facto sexual relationship and all sorts of other associated matters of that kind that would be extraordinarily colourable if they were to stand in the way of something taking place in an ordinary employment situation are routinely raised as barriers for particular relationships to be maintained or particular positions to be accepted in judicial or related proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the time, judges are disqualifying themselves from appearing in matters in which counsel or litigants may be involved with whom they have some relationship. When they do not do that, it is a proper occasion for concern. Senator Vanstone, in this March in this place, was full of enthusiastic vituperation on this subject. Without going into any more detail about it, on 9 March 1995, with regard to a family court case, she was saying that what matters is not the actual integrity or the impartiality of people involved&mdash;that may not be contested in a particular case&mdash;but the appearance, and that that appearance must be observed. If it is not observed, there has been some fundamental failing for which some political responsibility must be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone is on record as saying that. It was a quite proper thing for her to say. I do not in any way criticise her for saying it.

In other words, what he has done is demonstrate that he cannot separate his political prejudices from any capacity to reason or exercise judgment. The critical issue here is this: if matters of appearance are important, if you, Senator Evans, are genuinely concerned about the role that counsel assisting or the royal commissioner might play, why did you not raise the matters months ago? This royal commission was set up months back. In fact, it was about six weeks ago that Zoltan Kovacs first gave evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did we hear a complaint from Senator Evans that Zoltan Kovacs should not have been called at that point in time? Did we hear any complaints about the order of witnesses in the weeks following? No. What we had in that time was a furious attempt by Carmen Lawrence to close down this royal commission by hook or by crook, using taxpayers' funds to do so. There was never any complaint about the integrity of the royal commissioner or the political, perceived or actual bias of counsel assisting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has changed? Why is it that suddenly Senator Evans wants to raise questions in the mealy-mouthed way that he expresses them? He is not raising questions; he is making snide political criticisms under the guise of asking questions&mdash;a very low tactic. But why is he doing it now? The reason he is doing it now is that he has had to sit there and watch about a dozen of Carmen Lawrence's former colleagues go into the witness box and give evidence on oath, evidence that has been highly critical of her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What upsets you more than anything else is that these people are putting integrity before politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once these people went in there and gave that damning evidence, Carmen Lawrence suddenly decided that it was about time for a significant change of strategy.

But the royal commission itself makes a decision on good grounds that she should not be given the opportunity to be heard right now, she ought to take her place in the queue, and she ought to be able to hear all of what is said against her and given the opportunity to refute it.

He said, `I do not want to be taken as undermining family values on the principle that the family that preys together'&mdash;and he had to spell it out for our benefit so we all knew how grubby he really was. He wanted to make a very cute little point that he probably hoped would get a run on the television. So let there be no doubt what he was up to. He said almost a week ago:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cast no public aspersions on Mr Marks for taking up this particular job. That is a matter for his own conscience and he can live with that.</PARA>
<PARA>Let's just think about it. Are you seriously suggesting that anyone who takes up a political appointment to head up a royal commission must be politically motivated? Are you saying that because they get paid to do it somehow they are compromised? Are you saying that it is not proper?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what Stephen Smith said, of course. Stephen Smith gave a very non-oblique warning that anyone who cooperated, anyone who took the job, would be held to account by the Labor Party. I understand those `Keatingesque' tactics; that's the way he operates. But is that what Senator Evans is seriously suggesting? I don't think it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Evans has been careful up until 24 August to not criticise Ken Marks who has an impeccable record, a long and distinguished career as a judge of the Supreme Court in Victoria, who takes on a job knowing that he is likely to be subjected to very heavy political criticism. But in no respect is there anything you can point to since he has taken up that position that would constitute political bias. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do you now say? Once you get a decision that does not suit Carmen Lawrence's political interests you then turn around and argue that counsel assisting must be biased and because she is related by marriage to someone in politics that somehow is a basis for her standing down. What an appalling suggestion. Talk about guilt by association! Someone who has built a career at the bar&mdash;not just six months relying on Slater and Gordon to feed you a few dock briefs but someone who actually has practised the law for many years to take the brief to do the job that has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing for you to complain about the basis of the royal commission being set up. I can understand why you squirm on that subject. Senator Evans says there is no precedent for matters of this sort. I seem to recall the Petrov royal commission was very much looking at the conduct and role of Dr Evatt. You might squeal about that. In fact, there was a trial of a certain judge that resulted from an inquiry in this very chamber that resulted in criminal charges being laid. So there are plenty of precedents for investigating improprieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You see, the alternative espoused by Senator Evans, and no doubt of course enthusiastically adopted by the Prime Minister, is that, really, the place for these matters to be played out is in the parliament.

Did you do that? Of course you did not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does Senator Evans wait until now? It is because he is playing the dirty, grubby political game that Mr Keating plays.

Are you saying, for example, that any one of those former ministers or former staffers is lying? Are you saying that they are not doing their best to tell the truth and that somehow they have been suborned by the royal commission and somehow are out to get Carmen Lawrence, irrespective of the truth? I have not heard anyone say that yet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Lavarch was concerned about an issue recently&mdash;that is, the question of cabinet confidentiality and the ruling that was made. Did he go out there and say, `I know what this Marks is on about. He is politically motivated. He is just doing it so he gets Carmen Lawrence'? No, he did not. Effectively he said, `I debate the merits of the issue.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One has to go back and ask the question why this royal commission was set up. It was set up for two reasons and two reasons only. The first reason was to traduce Carmen Lawrence's reputation because she was a federal minister and a political asset to the Labor Party. There is no question about that. That is one of the reasons it was set up. That is the reason. That is the truth. It was set up for that reason. It was not set up when Richard Court came to power in March 1993, for such a critical reason. It was not set up in August 1993. It was not set up in December 1993. It was set up in May 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was not an urgent issue as to what occurred in parliament some months before the Court government came to power. It was not a matter that pressed them to have a royal commission straight away. It was a matter when Carmen Lawrence came to federal parliament and the Liberal Party wanted to traduce her reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second reason why the royal commission was set up&mdash;that is, the Western Australian Liberal Party was in a total mess and a diversion was required. I am not going to go into the details of that mess. I always believe you hunt and kill your own, and that is the responsibility of those on that side. The Western Australian Liberal Party went through turmoil. Whether for good or bad reasons, and I do not make a value judgment, they assassinated the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), they disposed of the member for Moore (Mr Filing), they have gone through all sorts of internal brawlings and now they have got rid of a sitting senator. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is the Western Australian Liberal Party was in a mess and needed a diversion. The person who really needed the diversion was Premier Court because he was part of all this. There is no use in his stepping aside now and saying he finds Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Campbell or someone else distasteful. He was part of the machine. He was part of the plotting. He was part of that internal viciousness that saw sitting members challenged and dumped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not make a comment on whether their successors are better or worse candidates, but they are in the headlines every day. John Howard, the federal Leader of the Opposition, went over to Western Australia. He addressed them. He could not get out of town fast enough. There was never a faster plane that left Western Australia than he took that particular day to get back to a function in New South Wales. He scuttled out like a slimy, skunky dog to get away from Western Australia because he could not stand the mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons why this royal commission was set up are twofold: firstly, to attack Carmen Lawrence and, secondly, to divert attention away from the internal problems of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party. We know that this decision was not made by the Premier. How do we know that? We found out yesterday. The Premier was asked, `Did you consult with John Howard?' He could not remember that, but he did say that the reason why he could not remember it was that he consulted with so many people. With whom did he consult in order to set up this royal commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this a decision of the government of Western Australia or is it a decision of the Liberal Party of Western Australia? With whom did Mr Court consult? We know he consulted with the leader of the National Party because he had to reduce the terms of reference otherwise the government may have been tangled up in the matter. We know the Premier discussed it with a whole range of people. It is not as though the government has made a decision in principle. The government made a decision to hold the royal commission almost two years after it came to power. That is how urgent it was. The real urgency is in the internecine warfare in the Western Australian Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about standards of behaviour we should look at the Fremantle by-election. Go back and read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and see what was said in the House of Representatives. Have a look at the disgraceful comments made by Wilson Tuckey and Eoin Cameron. Those comments were repeated in this chamber and Senator Hill, the great silent leader in this place, sat there and said nothing. Then he comes in today and pompously says that he wants standards of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great silent man, the leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, sits there and says nothing when these accusations are made.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a valid question of the order of the witnesses. I think any reasonable person would agree perhaps Carmen Lawrence would not appear just now. I can understand the opposition's argument on that because there are court cases and other things. But fancy holding a royal commission and not calling the person who put the petition down in the first few weeks! Fancy doing that! Fancy not calling the clerk of the Legislative Council who helped draw it up and who has great knowledge of these things! Why not? Why doesn't that happen if it is such a decent royal commission? Why won't they call those people? Why does Mr Halden have to defend himself and others in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> today? Because he will not be called to give evidence!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this royal commission is a political exercise. It is a perversion of what royal commissions should stand for. We have had some problems in the past with royal commissions because of the evidence rules. Royal commissions are different from courts and the rules of evidence that apply there. As a result, we reserve royal commissions for very important occasions. Senator Evans has gone through them in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have never had a royal commission into the behaviour of a parliamentarian. That is a matter for the parliament to determine. The parliament has an inquiry, it determines the matter, and it is over. But, no, in this case we have a royal commission set up. Normally royal commissions look at issues of criminality, security, corruption&mdash;all those sorts of things. There is nothing suggested in this case that involves those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hypocrisy and the double standards of this opposition! Who introduced these matters into the Western Australian parliament? They have not commented on it once. In 1986, who probably breached the Family Court Act and dumped all this onto the public domain? Mr Richard Court did so, and two of his colleagues later expanded on it. We have a 14-page speech on this stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, the terms of reference are very carefully crafted not to go to these particular matters&mdash;that might be embarrassing. It might be embarrassing to get Mr Court there and say, `Who gave you the information from this Family Court case? Why did you put it on the record?' I might go to Mr Lightfoot and all those others who did so. But, for the royal commission&mdash;the fair royal commission whose process Senator Alston supports&mdash;the terms of reference do not go to any of these matters. Why don't they? It does not suit the self-interest of the Liberal Party of Western Australia to go to any of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions of conflict of interest are difficult ones for this chamber or anyone else to deal with.

If anyone deserves to be censured in this place, it is Senator Hill, the leaderless leader of the Liberal Party in this place, because he enforces no standards whatsoever; none whatsoever.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Evans stood up and did yesterday&mdash;which I noticed Senator Alston has said he has had plenty of opportunity to do from the beginning of the commission&mdash;because his government perceived that they were in trouble over this issue, was to engage in a shameful attack on someone simply because of whom their relatives are. By doing that, he impugned the integrity not only of the commission and its staff but also, I might add, of myself. It is not possible for the allegation to stand that there is some collusion between me and my sister-in-law unless you come to the conclusion that I would stoop to interfere in royal commission proceedings. You must come to that conclusion in order to make that allegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since last year I have tipped off the Attorney-General's Department on something that they did not know&mdash;that is, they had a hole in their e-mail system the size of Texas&mdash;and since I returned to them in disk form what, if printed out, would have been the equivalent of a small truck load of documents, I am somewhat amazed that this government would stoop to challenge my integrity in the parliamentary process, let alone that of my sister-in-law. I have always believed that actions speak louder than words, and those actions speak for themselves. Let me move on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attack yesterday was the sixth or seventh in a series of attacks. First of all, when the announcement of the commission was made, we had the attacks primarily by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), but then by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who issued a dark warning to any judicial officer or former judicial officer or member of the profession who took part in these proceedings. The message was you will regret it if you do. That is how this started off: you will regret it if you do. The Prime Minister was a party to that attack; he probably set up Stephen Smith. But it does not matter which one set up the other; they were both in it up to their necks. It was a clear warning to any member of the profession, any member of the judiciary, any former member of the judiciary: you take part in this and you are fair game; we will tear you down. As Senator Ray says, we will go for hunt and kill. That is where it started. That is only the start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second attack was to say that it does not matter anyway because this is a witch-hunt. Government members seek to rely on the fact that the commission was set up this year to say that it is obviously out to get Dr Lawrence because she is a federal government minister. They seem to misunderstand that Dr Lawrence is somehow entwined in this royal commission not because she is a federal government minister but because she was a minister, the prime minister, the Premier at the time these matters arose. Senator Ray put much store on the timing. He said that it was not done immediately; that there was no urgency, otherwise it would have been done immediately. The fact that completely escaped his mind was that the royal commission into WA Inc.&mdash;set up by Dr Lawrence herself&mdash;inquired into matters around 10 years old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Royal commissions are not knee-jerk reactions. They are not something you pull on one day to do the next and to satisfy some immediate political need. They are a final resort. They are something you are drawn to when all other processes have not worked. When the community has lost faith in the political process, that is when you go outside parliament, that is when you set up a royal commission, that is when you look for independent counsel to assist the commission, and that is when you look for an independent commissioner and set up a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the second attack on this commission was that it was a witch-hunt. They sought to say that it was only called because she is a federal government minister, neglecting the fact that her involvement in it is because she was the Premier at the time, because all other processes have not been able to resolve the matter and because Western Australians are entitled to know whether their Premier at the time lied to them. That is an essential matter to the functioning of the proper parliamentary system. It simply does not work if cabinet ministers are allowed to lie and get away with it. If the truth cannot be got through the parliamentary process, one necessarily shifts to a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the third attempt? The third attempt at denigrating this commission was trying to scuttle it by tipping heaps and heaps of hard-earned taxpayers' money into it. They are people not earning as much as anybody here. The government has said, `Let's take their taxes and put $10,000 a day into Carmen's case to see whether we can scuttle this commission.' That was the third attempt at denigrating this commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was apparent that that attempt to denigrate the commission was not going to work immediately, they moved on to the fourth attempt, which was to pursue injunctive proceedings to shut down the commission. They were not happy when they lost that in the Supreme Court, so where did they go at taxpayers' expense?&mdash;all the way to the High Court, using hard-earned taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said, `Let's see whether we can shut this down. We failed at attempt one, we failed at attempt two and we failed at attempt three, so we will go all the way to the High Court and see whether, in the fourth attempt, we can shut this commission down. We don't want to hear what people have to say. We don't want to hear what former Labor ministers, close colleagues and staffers of Dr Lawrence have to say. We must shut this commission down.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when that did not work, they moved to chuck weapon No. 5 on the bonfire. They said, `Let's have a go at the commissioner. Let's ask him, through the Leader of the Government in the Senate, whether he can sleep happily at night with his conscience. Let's cast some doubt on the integrity of the commissioner. When all else has failed, let's go to the commissioner and see whether we can bring him down. Let's implement the first threat: to hunt and destroy any member of the profession, any member of the judiciary and any former member of the judiciary who goes anywhere near this commission.' They tried an attack on the commissioner. They asked him to check his conscience when he lays awake at night and worries whether he is doing the right thing, as though he would not every minute of the day be concerning himself with whether he was doing the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When attack No. 5 did not appear to work, they moved on to No. 6. That is where they got stuck into the commission for its process. As Senator Hill said, perhaps Senator Evans did this by appearances in the magistrate court. How he ever got his QC appointment we are at a loss to understand. I note that Senator Hill rightly points out that my sister-in-law got hers by hard work, not by ingratiating herself in the political process. Nonetheless, the sixth weapon was getting stuck into the processes of the commission. They said, `We do not know all the witnesses or what they are all going to say. We who want to scuttle it, shut it down and denigrate it will now take the high ground and say that we know how to run it. Furthermore, because you are not running it the way that we want it run, you must be a pack of politically motivated royal commissioners and staff because you now will not do what we want.' I think that was the sixth attempt to in some way to damage the commission. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the precedent for going to South Australia to get counsel assisting in a Western Australian commission was set by Dr Lawrence herself. Can we believe it! We'd better believe it, because it is true. What would have occurred to these people on the other side, who purport to have a brain&mdash;especially those in the B-team behind&mdash;is that Brian Martin QC was the Crown Solicitor in South Australia. My sister-in-law went to work for the Crown very early in her career, in 1979. She spent something like a decade, give or take a year or two, working for Brian Martin and learning from him. </PARA>

You would think that since Attorney-General Sumner was the Attorney-General for most of, if not for all of, those years, someone would have thought to say to him, `Hey, what do you think?' It is perfectly clear what he thinks. He took the opportunity to make a comment when she was made a Queen's Counsel. He made it clear that his government had decided they would not appoint any more Queen's Counsel. Of course, we are still waiting for Gareth Evans to give his up. But, nonetheless, he made it clear that his government had made that decision. He went on and said, `If you are going to have a Queen's Counsel, Ann Vanstone is an excellent appointment.'</PARA></TALK.START>

And Senator Evans, ill-informed as he is, says there is no precedent for this sort of commission with someone's sister or brother&mdash;sibling&mdash;acting in that commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, those opposite have forgotten the Fitzgerald royal commission and are not familiar with what is happening now in the New South Wales commission into the police.

I have yet to hear someone try to traduce Mr Crooke's reputation for the job that he did in the Fitzgerald royal commission. I have yet to hear that. It is a history lesson Senator Evans is yet to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I move on to highlight the peculiar nature of this vicious and unwarranted attack on my sister-in-law. As the point has been made with respect to Justice McHugh, who in this place queries Justice McHugh's entitlement to sit in the High Court simply because his wife has a job in the House of Representatives? Who over there is prepared to query that? Who is prepared to say that whenever the Commonwealth is a participant in High Court proceedings he should have no opportunity to form part of the bench on those occasions, or hear matters in the first instance as a single judge? Who over there is prepared to say that? Who over there is prepared to say that there is bias in that matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you why you are not prepared to say that. It is because the relationship between Justice McHugh and his wife is open and on the table. There is nothing to hide; it is all open for us all to see. That is why Justice McHugh did not disqualify himself, for example, from being part of the bench in the political ad bans case. Why would he? He was appointed on merit; the relationship with his wife is open. It is there for all to make an objective assessment about. There is nothing underhand about this. It is not like, I might say, the case I raised earlier this year where the judge had what was described as a serious and close relationship&mdash;I think that means sleeping&mdash;with a fellow who was a solicitor for one of the parties, and that relationship was not disclosed. That was the problem in that matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to the Gai Waterhouse amendment that I notice Senator Evans trying to squirm out of in one way or another.

It is a bit thin now, is it not, since this government wants to preach lack of discrimination against someone on the basis of the identity of their relatives but does not want to practise it&mdash;something we see so often in this place. </PARA>

Because they think they will want to denigrate the findings. Why would they think that? Because they suspect they know what the findings will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will recap&mdash;for the benefit of Senator Evans, who seemed to lose count&mdash;before I conclude.

No. 2, calling it a witch hunt&mdash;`Let's pretend this is not about parliamentary integrity; let's pretend it is all about Carmen Lawrence and her political career.

Attack No. 6, get stuck into the commission processes, even though this is the commission you do not want and do not want to be a part of&mdash;the commission you want to shut down&mdash;and then not worry about that because you will be entitled at any point to jump up and say, `I know better than any of you guys how to run this, and now I, Dr Lawrence, want to come on first but, by the way, I've got some witnesses that have to come before me because I think I know how to run this.'

It will have the safety valve of being able to do that and keep Dr Lawrence in office. That was your vicious slur yesterday, pathetically disguised today.

It is important that those questions were asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But before I turn to the detail of that, one of the things that I do agree with about this whole circumstance is that there is a massive injustice being perpetrated here. The massive injustice is not the injustice that is the subject of this motion. The massive injustice is the injustice that there is a royal commission at all into this affair in Western Australia and that the Senate has not moved to condemn the holding of that royal commission or the government that gave rise to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is true is that the government of Western Australia is mortally divided about the efficacy of holding this royal commission in the first place. We know that the deputy premier exercised considerable disquiet within the cabinet about that and leaked his disquiet to the Western Australian media. We know that the leader of the coalition party&mdash;the National Party&mdash;Hendy Cowan, did the same. They did it because they were concerned about the impropriety of the Premier of Western Australia dragging his government down the road of holding this royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the offence? The outstanding offence here is this royal commission. The fact that it is a judicial function and is steeped in judicial powers should not deflect anyone from recognising that, nonetheless, its origins and birth give rise to a political purpose that, as has been said in this debate, has nothing to do with whether or not anyone conducted themselves in a manner in which they abused their powers in office; nothing to do with whether anyone conducted themselves in a way that would endanger the national security; nothing to do with whether anyone was involved in financial mismanagement; and nothing to do with whether anyone misconducted themselves in terms of the exercise of executive power. It has nothing to do, in fact, with what have been the grounds, historically in this country, for the holding of royal commissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it has to do with is a political assassination of the reputation of the minister for health in this government, because she is a successful minister. As Senator Ray pointed out, we waited three years for this royal commission to arise. It was not urgent when the Court government came to power; it was not urgent in the first or second year of office. Suddenly, this royal commission is put on for the very reason that Carmen Lawrence is a successful minister; and she has to be destroyed. Also, we know it was put on to cover the massive disputation within the Liberal Party of Western Australia over the so-called&mdash;and I recognise him opposite&mdash;Noel Crichton-Browne affair which was disrupting the party. They needed a smokescreen to deflect public attention from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the details of the allegation. I will do so by starting with the words of Senator Amanda Vanstone when she talked about what has to happen in terms of justice being done and justice being seen to be done. Earlier, Senator Evans said that when he asked his questions he did so in order to establish not whether justice was being done, but whether&mdash;appropriately and properly, as a principle of our justice system&mdash;it was being seen to be done. On that subject, what has Amanda Vanstone, the shadow Attorney-General, said? I quote from an adjournment debate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on page 1716. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to distinguish between a finding of appearance of bias and actual bias. A finding of appearance of bias at law will overturn a decision on the basis that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done. The threshold for overturning a decision is therefore the appearance of bias. The question of whether actual bias was displayed need not be addressed. Confidence in the judicial system will be lost if there is a public perception of bias in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not an island opinion, isolated just to that occasion. She said further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the judge's action in creating an appearance of bias could in itself amount to misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA>So when you ask the question, `What is the relationship between two people who have a family relationship but are both key actors in this issue,' it goes to the very issue that Senator Vanstone herself was raising&mdash;the appearance of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an area of well-travelled judicial principle, an area in which there is great concern for precision and certainty. It is an area in which there was some doubt, given the principal roles of the actors, and needed to be put beyond doubt. Therefore, it was a reasonable question to ask. Has it been answered? Have we got a clear declaration from Senator Vanstone about it? Has she put it unequivocally beyond doubt that there is no discussion, or any sort of discussion, and things are acting in a way in which propriety holds all and the well-travelled principles of legal conduct are beyond dispute? No, she hasn't. She had her opportunity a few minutes ago to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Did she come out unequivocally and do it? Absolutely not. Given that she had her opportunity, why didn't she? She was invited to by Senator Gareth Evans, but she squibbed it. She did not say it and the question still hangs while she dodges it. The issue is: if she is dodging it, why is she dodging it? She was given a clear invitation and she should, to rightly and properly clear up this mess, say so openly. But it is now a matter of record in the Senate that she did not. One can only assume, since she knew, that she dodged it; and, therefore, that does raise a significant question, and one that ought to be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other questions that were asked in that exchange go to issues that are in the mind of ordinary people&mdash;the plain person, the man or woman on the Pentonville omnibus, the person who forms what is a reasonable person's view of what is appropriate in these circumstances. There are questions about this commission that ought to be properly asked. Given its birth, given the controversy of it, given its purpose, given the political inspiration and witch-hunt character of the way in which the Liberal government in Western Australia set it up, there are a series of questions about its conduct that now should be asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are the witnesses being streamed in the way in which they are? Why are people who are being traduced in the public debate, like Carmen Lawrence, who speaks out for herself, getting a warning from the commission that if they do so they will be in contempt? No-one else got a warning. Everyone else was speaking out. Editorial writers were opining away. Commentators on television were giving views. It was a matter of notorious public debate. But as soon as Carmen Lawrence said, `Hang on. I am the victim of all this. I'd like to say my piece,' the commissioner says, `If you do, you'll be in contempt.' What are her rights? She does have them. She is entitled to some respect. This is not a trial, as Senator Alston would say. It is not a trial, although he claims it to have been a trial. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the normal course of any judicial function in a circumstance like this, the foundational thing would be to give that person, at least, the right of funding so they can defend themselves in the process. Has the Western Australian government funded Carmen Lawrence after having set up a royal commission to attack her? They have not. As soon as we, as the federal government, say, `This is one of our ministers who is being attacked because she is one of our ministers, and for no other reason, so if they won't do the right thing we will,' we get attacked by the opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that the government has woven a web of deceit, starting with certain comments and each time the issue keeps going they have to add to this total package. Let's look at what the motion actually says. It has nothing to do with the royal commission. It has nothing to do with Dr Lawrence's behaviour. It has nothing to do with the opposition. The motion deals with Senator Gareth Evans's cowardly and unfounded attack upon the integrity and reputation of Royal Commissioner Marks and counsel assisting, Ms Ann Vanstone QC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook and others have tried to assert, as did Senator Evans, that all they were doing was raising questions. Allow me to read from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of yesterday&mdash;and it is very telling because Senator Evans starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not want to be taken as undermining family values&mdash;-</PARA>
<PARA>Then he gets cut off on a point of order. There is half a column of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and then Senator Evans continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I was saying, I do not want to be taken as undermining family values on the principle that the family that preys together&mdash;spelt `e-y-s'&mdash;stays together.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what Senator Evans did was pre-meditated. He thought about it. It was not a spur of the moment assertion, question or allegation. He had thought about it. He had pre-meditated and tried to assert that because Amanda Vanstone and Ann Vanstone are related through marriage, somehow they had `preyed' together and set out to somehow corrupt the royal commission and the outcomes of that royal commission. That is what we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully accept that in the heat of political debate one can make a silly comment and that after some hours one can say, `Look, I have made a mistake. Yes, I do apologise.' That is what Senator Robert Hill gave Senator Evans today. He gave him the opportunity to apologise for that gross statement about Ms Vanstone QC. The sort of honour that would be required of a UN general secretary, the sort of honour that you might expect from a High Court judge, is not to be found in Senator Evans. After 24 hours reflection, there is an incapacity to apologise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, he digs himself in deeper by trying to assert that all he was doing was raising a question. He did more than raise a question. He made the direct allegation that the family that `preyed' together stayed together. The implication was very clear for the Vanstone family. Senator Evans, you ought to be ashamed of that. You ought to have the integrity to apologise, but, unfortunately, you do not. Senator Evans's contributions on this matter in recent times make a pig's grunt sound eloquent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we were to accept that there is some hint of bias, they have not answered the question about Justice McHugh, who is married to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. His Honour has to sit on the High Court bench and make determinations on federal legislation which has a profound effect on the Australian Labor Party and this government. Yet nobody on the Labor side of the chamber is suggesting that he ought to resign or, indeed, that Ms McHugh ought to resign her ministry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The brother of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, is a member of the Labor Party. Should John Howard's brother resign from the Australian Labor Party because he is related to John Howard, the Leader of the Liberal Party?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, to err is human. We can all make mistakes, but when you are given the opportunity to apologise you ought to have the good grace to apologise. If Senator Evans did that, we would have had the full question time today. Of course, the grace to apologise does not rest in the soul of Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in case people think that this is a Liberal beat-up, because that is the way those speakers opposite have tried to present it today, let me quote from Mike Seccombe. I have to say that in my 18 months in this place I have not known Mike Seccombe to be an apologist for the Liberal and National parties. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funny that they&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should think the kind of defamatory slur that got them in this mess should get them out.</PARA>
<PARA>The defamatory slur is what started this mess, and they have perpetuated it right through. They continued it yesterday and repeated it today. What Mike Seccombe did was point out that somehow they think that if they repeat the tactic they will get themselves out of the trouble that that sort of defamatory slur got them into in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are the attacks on the royal commission because of the timing of the calling of witnesses. Let us remember that the minister, Carmen Lawrence, did not want to appear before the royal commission. She wanted to abolish the royal commission. Now, all of a sudden, she wants to appear. As I have said in this place before, I think it is highly appropriate that any witness that might give evidence to which Dr Lawrence might wish to respond, ought to give his or her evidence first to give Dr Lawrence the capacity to respond. Procedural fairness would dictate that. There is no way that one could argue against that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would Dr Lawrence be saying if she was the first witness called and then there was a cricket team of witnesses giving evidence contrary to her evidence which she did not have the opportunity to respond to? She would have to be called again and again. What absolute nonsense. Senator Evans ought to know a lot better about procedural fairness. I have spoken about Mike Seccombe's comments, but what about Peter Cole-Adams from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>? He says about your behaviour, Senator Evans:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one point, Evans went over the top, in an ugly reference to Ann Vanstone . . .</PARA>

<PARA>that is, about the principle of impartiality. He then went over the top. Senator Vanstone then reminded him about the legislation that this government is supposedly supporting whereby it would be illegal to discriminate against somebody on the basis of whom they are married to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could talk about the royal commission. We could say that it all started because Dr Lawrence wanted to torpedo Richard Court and that it has backfired. It has blown up in her face. That is not the content of this motion. This motion talks about the cowardly and unfounded attack on the integrity and reputation of Royal Commissioner Marks and counsel assisting. That is what we have to confine our remarks to today. I have referred to the comments of Mike Seccombe and Peter Cole-Adams. I believe every other decent thinking Australian would say that we should keep those sorts of relationships out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is an arrogant government. This a government which had people such as Graham Richardson, who said, `Don't worry about morality. The only question is whatever it takes.' Senator Robert Ray told us that in the political process `we hunt and kill our own'. What a great statesman, what a man of great stature, what a man of great morality, what a man of integrity, to come into this house and tell us that all these things are somehow political virtues. And when he tells us about the Batman preselection, `It is not about fairness; it is about outcomes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the way Senator Evans has behaved in this matter. He is not concerned about fairness to the royal commissioner. He is not concerned about fairness to Ann Vanstone QC. He is about trying to keep Carmen Lawrence alive politically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You ought to realise, Senator Evans, that you do not build Carmen Lawrence up by trying to chop the royal commissioner and counsel assisting off at the knees. You do not build up Dr Lawrence in that way. You ought to be concerned about fairness. Dr Lawrence will stand or fall on her own evidence, on the outcome of the royal commission and on the judgment of the people of Australia. But you do not make her task any easier by attacking the royal commissioner and the counsel assisting. Senator McKiernan, who I note is sitting opposite in the chamber, suggested that Dr Lawrence ought to go before a royal commission and ought to be giving evidence and things of that nature. But, as I have said, that is not the issue in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray, in his contribution today, was unusually quiet and lacking in substance. He was unable to deal with the basis of the motion. The only time he got near it was when he tried to make an attack on me relating to questions during Senate estimates. I thought he was wrong at the time and I said so by way of an interjection. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 21 June 1994 will disclose that. He mentioned a person's name in this house, a person whose name I never mentioned at all during the questions at Senate estimates. My question at those hearings was:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have seen today is the most extraordinary behaviour by Senator Evans, because Senator Evans concluded his speech to this Senate by saying that he made no apology for anything that he said yesterday. That is what this censure motion revolves around; it revolves around Senator Evans's conduct in question time yesterday; it revolves around whether his remarks were a proper comment to be made and also whether Senator Evans's conduct was befitting an officer of the Crown, a person holding high office, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. That is what this motion is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not about Carmen Lawrence. I could talk about cricket teams against her, but it is not about that, so let us leave that out of it. It is not about Carmen Lawrence; it is not about Richard Court; and it is not about Carmen Lawrence exercising her rights to challenge the inquiry with $10,000 of our taxpayers' money. That is irrelevant, too. All the things we have heard from the government side in defence of Senator Evans are irrelevant as well, because the defence we have heard from the government's side today is what I call the bus driver defence; that is, you pile everybody into a Brisbane City Council Brookfield bus and you drive them around and around in circles and you never get to a conclusion. Senator Evans would probably be pretty pleased with that because, if we got to the conclusion, Senator Evans would be in grave difficulty because the fact is that Senator Evans has refused to apologise&mdash;not once, but twice&mdash;for his grotesquely based comments about Ann Vanstone QC in this Senate chamber yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just so everybody knows how gross and base those comments were, I am going to remind Senator Evans. He started off by saying, `I do not want to be taken as undermining family values,' and then he was interrupted&mdash;not once, but 11 times&mdash;by the President, Senator Ian Macdonald, Senator Hill, Senator Knowles, Senator Bob Collins and Senator McMullan. Then he continued and said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, I do not want to be taken as undermining family values on the principle that the family that preys together&mdash;spelt `e-y-s'&mdash;stays together.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on to impugn the impartiality of the commissioner, Mr Marks QC, as well impugning the impartiality of counsel assisting, Ann Vanstone QC. This was a deliberate, premeditated attack on&mdash;not one, but two&mdash;highly reputable Queen's Counsel. I stress&mdash;not one, but two of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a deliberate attack, but we gave him the benefit of the doubt. We said, `Maybe Senator Evans was full of passion, in the flow of anger or whatever it might be. We will start question time today by giving Senator Evans the opportunity to apologise.' Senator Evans not only failed to apologise; Senator Evans embarked on another disreputable attack on Ann Vanstone and a disreputable attack on members of the opposition as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worthy of note that this attack&mdash;an attack which alleges collusion; an attack which borders on alleging a conspiracy to corrupt a royal commission&mdash;must also be an attack upon Senator Vanstone. Whether one agrees with Senator Vanstone's politics or not, Senator Vanstone's actions, her undoubted integrity, speak louder than any words that Senator Evans can throw at her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody in this place can accuse Senator Vanstone of anything less than the highest standing of political integrity because last year, given the opportunity to gravely embarrass the government by being presented leaked material, she instead took the task of exposing the flaw in the government's security and returning the documents to the government without ever disclosing to anybody what those documents were. That is the integrity of Senator Vanstone and that too has been impugned by Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see that what Senator Evans has been involved in is a most disreputable, a most grotesque and a base attack on the good reputation of three people. And he failed to withdraw those allegations. But it is worse than that, because in his defence, Senator Evans said, `I want to put on the record what I said yesterday,' and then proceeded to quote very selectively from the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He spoke about how he had said that maybe it was just a matter of coincidence that counsel assisting the royal commission was the sister-in-law of the shadow Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he went on to say that he had said yesterday that it was not just that propriety occur but that propriety be seen to occur. This is the grave sin that he committed today. He said to the Senate, `And I said nothing stronger than that'. Of course, he said something stronger than that. He accused Senator Vanstone and Ann Vanstone QC of conspiratorially preying on people. That is what he did. So he has misled the Senate as well. In his desperate effort to defend himself he has misled the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans had the opportunity to withdraw. He did not withdraw. Senator Evans had the opportunity to put the record straight in a full, frank and honest way, and Senator Evans has failed to do that. That is not the standard of conduct that is befitting the Leader of the Government in the Senate and that is why Senator Evans should be censured by this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is more than that, because Senator Evans was defended by his mates, who said, `We're proud of what he did. We're proud of the way he is defaming people.' Senator Cook got up and said that he was proud of what Senator Evans did. Well, I am ashamed of what Senator Evans did, even though I sit on the other side of the chamber. If we are going to start defaming people or slurring their integrity because of their family relationships, then heaven help the good governance of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we going to slur Mr Justice McHugh? I hope not. Are we going to slur Justice Elizabeth Evatt on the basis that her father was a Labor minister and her uncle was leader of the Labor Party federally? I hope not. Are we going to slur Mr Gary Crooke? I hope not. So what are we going to do? Are we going to allow this particular matter to go unpunished&mdash;one of the gravest slurs that I have heard in this chamber? It is not just a slur against a member of the opposition&mdash;we are used to that from the Labor Party; this was a slur against two eminent Queen's Counsel and a member of this Senate whose integrity has never before been impugned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gravity of the attack that we heard from Senator Evans is truly despicable. The suggestion that either Ann Vanstone QC or Mr Marks QC is manipulating a royal commission is thoroughly despicable and made without any basis at all in fact, based only in Senator Evans's prejudice and dripping vitriol. We are being asked by the other side not only to endure that but also to vote with the other side and condone it. What Senator Evans did can never be condoned in this chamber. It is about time that the integrity of the Australian Senate was maintained by censuring Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by highlighting some of the comments that were made by Senator Faulkner who said that he was disappointed that the Senate was being used to malign the reputations of people who did not deserve to be maligned. I agree with Senator Faulkner in that. The Senate was used yesterday by Senator Evans in a premeditated and despicable fashion to undermine the integrity of three very fine Australians who certainly did not deserve to be maligned. I believe that, if Senator Faulkner had the courage of his convictions, he would vote with the opposition in support of the censure motion and vote to ensure that Senator Evans is brought to book for his disreputable conduct in question time yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise if we did not understand, Senator Baume, that you were giving a personal explanation in relation to the debate. When you began to speak, we thought it was on an earlier matter. I think it is appropriate just to wind up the arguments in relation to this particular debate, which is the censure of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, for his cowardly and unfounded attack upon the integrity and reputations of Royal Commissioner Marks and counsel assisting, Ms Ann Vanstone QC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just foreshadow that the Greens will be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Kernot to delete the words `cowardly and' and will retain our support for the censure motion. The basis for doing that&mdash;it is a very serious matter in the midst of a whole series of rather untasteful slanging matches within question time of the last few weeks&mdash;is that, it is important that when a royal commission is set up and when somebody who is involved in that is working, they should not be impugned because of a relationship they might have with somebody who has the misfortune of being on the political scene and working here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add, and this is one of the concerns that Senator Margetts and I had, that we did feel there was a measure of legitimacy to the comment raised by Senator Evans yesterday, which was to defend the perception of fairness and openness and to step aside from any conflict of interest matter. To that degree he could have gained our support. However, the way and the manner in which he did that was absolutely outrageous. We may well be used to these kinds of attacks going across the chamber to one another. I believe it was an attack on Senator Vanstone rather than on her sister-in-law or on the royal commission, but it certainly became an attack on them. I believe that is not something that we should support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have often said that accusations always reveal much more about the accusers than anyone else. I just wonder whether the imputation we might make from the accusation that Senator Evans made was that, if a family member of the ALP were involved in something like that, it would be impossible for them not to communicate information with each other. I was pleased to see several members of the front bench repudiate that when they said that it would be utterly inappropriate if that should happen. I think because that is so, they should not make those accusations themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another comment that was made was a repeated kind of running down of the royal commission. I have often said that I do not necessarily agree with the setting up of the royal commission. However, there is no question that there was a legal basis for it being set up. The reason for the delay, which was raised many times as though there were some kind of Liberal Party plot that it had taken three years for the commission to be set up, does need some reminding about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the government has forgotten that, if the royal commission could have been called when the now Premier, Richard Court, were the Leader of the Opposition, it may well have been done except that it was not possible at that time. Maybe when Mr Court became Premier he could have set it up at that time; he would have if he had been able to have any evidence. Actually, it was two former cabinet ministers who provided the evidence, and that was the timing that was involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that as a way of justifying it; I am just pointing out that there are lots of accusations flying around that are not appropriate. I do not want to put any more remarks on the table but simply to say that it is with regret that we support this censure motion. We do feel it is appropriate. It is a good reminder that the level of this debate needs to be more focused on proper conduct within the parliament and needs to refrain from taking advantage of our parliamentary privilege by slinging accusations at other places like royal commissions and courts of law. For that reason, we will be supporting the motion. </PARA>

Therefore, it is extremely important that the small daily opportunities that exist for the real work of the Senate to take place continue to happen. We are using this opportunity today to move to suspend standing orders so that the work of the Senate can continue, that scrutiny and accountability can continue today and that the public basically will see, for some of today, what we believe we are really here for, which is to do the work of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Needless to say, the government will be opposing this suspension of standing orders. We faced a rather unusual situation in the Senate this afternoon when, just shortly after 2 o'clock, Senator Hill proposed a censure motion. It has taken three hours to complete that debate this afternoon. Senator Hill, even in moving this censure motion, did note how unusual it was to move this at the commencement of question time. This is what was said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an extremely unusual action for us to take. It is some years since we interrupted question time, which I guess demonstrates how important we regard this matter to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Gareth Evans</EMPHASIS>&mdash;It replaces question time&mdash;you understand that?</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the government will not support the suspension of standing orders to have question time now. The opposition does have a right to move a censure motion or propose the suspension of standing orders at any time. That was a right that Senator Hill exercised at the commencement of question time today. He did so knowing full well that question time would not be held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone is aware that a censure motion of a minister or the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) would normally take longer to debate than just the hour of question time. The option was open to the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hill, to obviously move a censure motion at some later stage of the day, or earlier in the day, and perhaps not interrupt the processes of question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that Senator Hill has the capacity to move the suspension of standing orders at any time. But all senators need to acknowledge that, if such a motion is moved at the commencement of question time, there ought to be no expectation from any senator, particularly any opposition senator, that question time will proceed after the conclusion of a censure debate. I believe no-one could seriously suggest that you could have it both ways in this regard. </PARA>

She has said, `We will not only change the procedure about when we will have question time but also change all the procedures. We are going to change how we do it and we are going to decide how many questions the government will answer. We will throw the baby out with the bathwater.' I can see that I have convinced Senator Hill with the strength of the arguments I have presented. I have indicated that the government will be opposing the suspension. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I pointed out by way of interjection, the Democrats were not even consulted as to the procedures that were going to be instituted at 2 o'clock. Indeed, when the motion was handed around it was clearly scribbled at very short notice and we were about 15 minutes into the debate before we even got a copy of the motion. I take it from what I see on my left that the Greens were not consulted either, nor was Senator Harradine. So you have a substantial portion of the Senate not even consulted about the abolition of question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has been doing their darnedest to cut us down to one question a day. Now they have taken question time away all together. I put it to them that it is only fair that they reconsider their position if they are minded to agree with the government on this and at least give us question time now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully support the argument that Senator Margetts has used in supporting her motion for the suspension of standing orders. Listening to the debate this afternoon and knowing that people out there are saying that the parliament and parliamentarians are out of touch with people, the real loss in the debate this afternoon has been parliament itself. When you get one side accusing the other of some misdemeanour and, in defence, the other side attacks saying, `Oh yes, but you did so and so' the organisation itself suffers and parliament is brought into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I appeal on those grounds to senators to support the suspension of standing orders and to let us have question time. That is, perhaps above any other part of the parliamentary proceedings, the part which demonstrates the proper democratic processes at work, where the opposition, the minor parties and the Independents can question government ministers as to their performance in relation to the management of all aspects of the governance of this country&mdash;the economy, social welfare, the environment and so on and so forth.

I accept the argument you put that they could well have asked their question, taken offence at the answer and then moved their suspension after question time. They chose not to do that. We have to deal with the situation as it is now, at 20 past five. Given that circumstance, I would appeal particularly to the opposition to support the motion for the suspension of standing orders to allow us to have question time and to get on with the questions. After all, the 28 questions with supplementaries is approximately what we have anyway. So do not take offence at that feature of the motion. Let us have question time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the motion for the suspension of standing orders. I realise that the opposition in consideration of their priorities had every entitlement to do what they did today, that is, to seek the suspension of standing orders. I would have argued, as it has just been argued, that maybe that should have been done after question time. I could get up after this and move to take note of the answer given by Senator Evans to Senator Hill if I wanted to and that would be another half an hour. So consideration should be given at least to a half an hour of questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the opposition to consider this proposal. When it comes to exercising our functions of audit of government actions, question time is very important to us and I am sure it is very important to the opposition. I have had my question this week. I chose to ask a question of the minister representing the minister for employment on the very vexed question of the high youth unemployment. I could equally have directed a question which was a lineball to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) on the issue of the Beijing conference, where we have one representative who refused at estimates committee to agree that there is coercion in China's one-child policy&mdash;a policy which requires a fine of three times the annual income of a family if the woman does not undergo an abortion, payable in three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we miss question time today we will have achieved the result of utilising the time that is usually set aside for questions of the ministers of the government to cover party political arguments on one issue and one issue only and to ignore every other item of government business. The opposition, by exercising its rights to put a censure motion at any time, when it chooses to do so at question time&mdash;and that is not in dispute; it is its right and neither is it in dispute that it is a serious matter&mdash;at the same time is denying the democratic rights of everyone else in this chamber, including the government and the ministers. So it is not at all an inappropriate motion for Senator Margetts to put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have effectively been deprived of our rights by the time allocated to this censure motion. Nobody from the Democrats, the Greens or the Independents was warned of this possibility. If this motion for the suspension of standing orders is supported&mdash;and I urge my opposition colleagues and the government to consider this&mdash;we would certainly be willing to go straight to the vote and put it. You may feel that 28 questions is inappropriate and that a lot of the material that is normally canvassed in question time has already been canvassed. That could well be argued. We may be left with some substantial questions which have all the verbiage that is usually addressed in question time removed because we have already dealt with most of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I advise the Senate that this matter arose out of the delay by the government in pursuing this bill through the Senate. I remind the Senate again that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) accused the opposition during the recent recess of delaying the bill and thereby penalising small companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this First Corporate Law Simplification Bill is to make it easier for small companies to be managed. It allows small private companies to operate with a single director and a single member and allows them to avoid having to put in financial reports and having an annual general meeting. These are laudable things and will make the process of running small business easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should have pushed this bill through the parliament months ago but deliberately chose, during the last session, to leave it until the second last day, when only a few minutes was allowed and, the last day, when again only a few minutes was allowed. As a consequence, the bill did not go through in the last session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One consequence of the delay caused by the government was that small business brought to our attention some potential problems with the bill&mdash;that is, the definition of small and large companies: those which would get this benefit of not having to report and not having to put in financial statements, and those, the large ones, which would. As a consequence, the opposition moved an amendment&mdash;moved by Senator Vanstone and passed by the Senate&mdash;that this matter should go off to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, which has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee held hearings this week&mdash;on Monday night and yesterday&mdash;and I am pleased to say that the report essentially looks at the options for this definition of which companies have to report and which companies are exempt. There were four options we looked at. The first was whether we should increase the threshold of the definition of what makes a company small or large. There are three criteria in the bill dealing with that, and for a company to be declared large it has to meet two out of the three criteria&mdash;that is, turnover of $10 million, assets of $5 million and the number of employees more than 50.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposal was that the exemption power of the Australian Securities Commission under section 313 of the Corporations Law be examined whereby compliance could impose an unreasonable burden on the company, its officers or auditor. The ASC reported to us that the criteria needed further clarification if we were going to go down that route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third option put before us was to drop the need to have an audit altogether&mdash;a proposal which actually works for very small companies in the UK. The fourth option was that proposed by the accountants&mdash;that is, to retreat from the definition of `large-small', as set out in the bill, and go back to what the accountants call a reporting entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee ended up agreeing with option two as I have just outlined&mdash;in other words, that we should go with the route of the exemption power for the Australian Securities Commission as set out in the Corporations Law. We rejected the accountants' proposal from the previous report in March this year. On the basis of evidence we heard, the committee confirmed today that the right way to go was to retreat from the small-large criteria, as set out in the bill, and go back to a reporting entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it came to our attention that there are problems with some companies. For example, some motor traders may be called `large' because their assets go beyond $5 million, their turnover beyond $10 million and their number of employees often beyond 50, but they are not often regarded as very large companies and as such would be unfairly penalised if they were forced to pay audit fees as required by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the committee recommends that, in order to give guidance to the Australian Securities Commission, the bill be altered, by way of section 313 of the Corporations Law, to exempt a proprietary company, and there be set in there the criteria to guide the ASC&mdash;the expected cost of burden of audit, the expected public interest or benefit of making information available, the number of creditors, the nature and extent of the company's liabilities, whether in the first year the company is required to prepare audited accounts or whether the company is one which is likely to repeatedly be moving in and out of the large proprietary company category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that, if that is done, the ASC would follow its normal procedure, which is a public procedure, in seeking exemptions. The key points there are: to invite applications for relief, to publish guidelines in the business community about when relief may apply, to hold public consultations, to advise the Attorney-General, and to provide a review mechanism. The committee is in thorough agreement with this, and we think this is the only practical way of getting out of the problem that has been legitimately raised by business interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also add that the business interests that appeared before us last Monday night&mdash;the ACCI, the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Motor Traders Association&mdash;all supported the committee's previous decision to stick with the `small-large' definition of what is a large and what is a small company rather than going with the accountants' definition. That is basically why the committee has stuck with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think the process that has been proposed by the committee must be taken up by the government. I wish to condemn the government for not taking up this matter before. The business groups which appeared before us last Monday night had put submissions to the government over a month ago. The government told them not to advise the opposition of what they were proposing and rejected their proposals out of hand. But the committee&mdash;chaired by the government and with a majority held by the government&mdash;in handing down this report today, has found that these people did have matters of substance to put before the parliament. As a consequence, the committee recommends that the bill be altered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on its hard work in trying to fix up some more government-flawed legislation. The volume of flawed legislation that comes before this place is evident from the volume of amendments, often forced at the last minute, to legislation which not only is badly thought out but also, in some instances, is bad in principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not taking the dog in the manger approach of saying to the voters of Australia, `Look, you elected this lot. You deserve to get the consequences of the sort of grubby, incompetent legislation that this lot gives you.' That is one political opportunity that any opposition has. We take, however, a more responsible approach, which may well be to our disadvantage: we seek to fix up the mess that the government continually makes of legislation&mdash;as we are seeking to do in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it means that the people of Australia are continually protected from the consequences of pretty rubbishy, incompetent legislation which often has enormous volumes of unintended consequences which work to the massive disadvantage of Australians. In this case, as a result of coalition pressure, there was a recognition by the Senate that this matter had to be re-examined. There had been lengthy examination. There is no doubt about that. But despite that lengthy examination, there were clear flaws in the way this legislation would operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I am very glad indeed that following this latest committee hearing&mdash;and I commend Senator Gibson for his role in that&mdash;we do have a situation where, I believe, there is now an opportunity for some of the unintended consequences to be avoided, particularly by providing the ASC with guidelines on the manner in which they should examine whether or not a company is a large or small company for the purposes of detailed reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say, initially, that I commend the proposal that small proprietary companies should no longer have to go through the enormous burden of reporting which has been imposed upon them for many years, even though I am a strong believer in the principle that, if you give someone the benefits of limited liability, there are offsetting massive obligations to the community, which has given you that right, to avoid the risks of financial loss if your company goes broke. There are far too many Australians who have been robbed of their assets&mdash;some of their livelihoods, some of their businesses and many of their savings&mdash;by people who have hidden behind the corporate veil to rip them off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, while I believe it is absolutely vital to have an effective system of regulation, as this report tabled today says in passing, one must recognise that there should be some assessment of the benefits of the regulatory requirements as against the costs of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that under this government the costs of compliance with a mountain of legislation have got totally out of hand. It is just ridiculous to have these huge costs of compliance with ever-mounting laws. The 1,130-odd pages of the taxation act have blossomed under this government to 3,360-odd, thus massively increasing the costs of compliance. The same goes for the sales tax legislation, the fringe benefits tax, you name it. And, of course, on top of that the Commissioner of Taxation keeps putting out statements massively amending the law without reference to parliament, requiring a whole lot of additional compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do have some problems with some elements of the recommended changes here. Apart from anything else, if you are to have the criteria that establishes whether or not you have to report in detail&mdash;and if you are a big proprietary company now you have to report in great detail, you have to have an audited set of accounts which have to be filed with the Australian Securities Commission&mdash;whether you are a big or small company, you have to be aware of the `value' of your assets, the size of your company in employment and the volume of turnover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns about policing this are that I do not know how the ASC plans to ensure that people who do meet that criteria in fact report, because so far the ASC has done very little indeed to ensure that its database on proprietary companies is accurate. I will want to see a commitment from the Securities Commission to recognise that these changes bring a burden of responsibility for it to require people in this situation to meet their requirements. That might well mean that the Securities Commission should adopt the same sort of spot audit approach that the tax commissioner does in the matter of self-assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised this matter repeatedly with the Securities Commission and under the old system of exempt proprietary companies it had no interest or desire to do down that track whatsoever. My own view is that the commission had better go down it now because it has been relieved of a massive burden of supervision with all small companies now exempted from those requirements. So it means that the Securities Commission can address itself to the question of whether those who should report are reporting accurately and properly. The ASC has a legal obligation to ensure that its database is accurate, and for years the ASC has been unable to meet that obligation to meet that requirement. This legislation gives it the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I also have some concerns about the three hurdles that someone has to get over before being regarded as a small company and therefore exempted. I notice that such a company's assets are to be taken into account&mdash;$5 million in assets. Quite frankly, I think the report is wrong in this matter regarding assets as the test rather than liabilities. As Mr Govey from the Attorney-General's Department admits in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of this committee meeting on Tuesday 29 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sure, you will get some companies which quite deliberately understate their assets or turnover in order to avoid being classified as large. That is the usual enforcement problem which I guess any regulator has.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But at the end of the day it will be relatively clear on which side of the line they fall when they are looked at.</PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, I do not think it is sensible to have a test that can be so easily avoided. I know the legislation does say, `What is the test of an asset?' and it should be by the accounting standards. But the fact is that liabilities are the clear and much more relevant matter that should be taken into account&mdash;not just liabilities but external liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discussion before the committee on this point seemed inadequate because the people involved, it seemed to me, from the task force were not focusing on the reality of external liabilities; in other words, liabilities owed to people outside the company structure. They simply dismissed the concept because they said, `Ah, but a lot of the liabilities are internal.' Of course they are, but this provides a much more realistic hurdle and would remove the problems, I believe, of many companies that should not be regarded as large for these purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to allow a `grandfathering' of this matter so that people who have their accounts audited but do not file them with the ASC should be allowed to get away with it for a couple of years, I think, is disgraceful. It gives them a competitive advantage over those new companies entering the field. They will be forced to reveal their full audited accounts as against those existing ones which do not have to. That seems totally unprincipled. I regret that the committee has come to that decision, while recognising that for many companies it would be inconvenient. But, Mr Govey says that the reasons for doing this are, essentially, simply pragmatic. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I would also like to address my remarks to the motion that the Senate take note of the committee's report. As stated by Senator Gibson and Senator Baume, a particular matter within the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill was referred back to the committee by the Senate. Otherwise, all matters within this bill are agreed upon by the committee. But there was that contentious matter of the small-large test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made a dissenting report for the second time in our deliberations on the small-large test. I dissented from the committee's view when it first handed down its report. When the Senate referred this matter back to the committee, I again dissented from the main committee report. While it was a difficult matter for the committee to decide on the options on reporting, nevertheless, it was not a unanimous decision in the final analysis. I preferred the reporting entity test against the small-large test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Substantially and briefly, my reasons were, firstly, that the reporting entity test is an accepted accounting standard. A very compelling submission was put to the committee by the two largest accounting bodies, which should know more about this matter than anyone else&mdash;the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Accountants. Two powerful and representative bodies supported the reporting entity test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason, and probably the main reason, is that the small-large test will affect business and the integrity of the legislation because it is open to rorting and avoidance on a grand scale. Asset valuation, which is one of the tests, is open to rorting. No-one is quite sure how those assets are going to be valued. The legislation does not mention whether it will be taken on directors' valuations, historical costs, a particular depreciation regime and so on. So the assets test is open to avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is a disincentive to employ. As we know, one of the criteria is 50 employees. There is no mention in the legislation of whether those employees are full-time, part-time, on or off, or whether that is just a benchmark on 30 June. Of course, that is a disincentive. Prior to 30 June if you wish to drop below that benchmark of 50 you will put an employee off. You may decide not to employ that extra person, that 50th employee, because there will be a cost not only in respect of that employee but also with auditing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told at the committee hearings about the proliferation of trust companies that would be set up to avoid this test. Those that now fall into the large category will be burdened with extra auditing costs. That is why I agreed with the very compelling submissions from the accounting bodies that a far better test would be the reporting entity test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this is a very complex matter and one that many would find hard to follow. However, there is a very basic point at issue here&mdash;that is, that many small businesses are now going to have to pay extra auditing fees. This does not simplify the legislation, as it was hoped in the bill; it is an extra cost and a complication. It is just like the tax act. This legislation will result in added costs and complications for businesses that can least afford them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would have thought that the business representatives would have noted this and gone in far stronger at the second hearing of the committee. They could have represented small business far more vigorously than they did. Anyone at those committee meetings would have realised that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry representatives were at best, to put it kindly, very equivocal and at worst betrayed small business. The fact that the Senate deferred this matter as a result of the submissions of several business groups gave the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry a chance to have the large-small test abolished and have it replaced with a far cheaper and less complicated measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its submission, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry pointed out that the new audit fees would impose on many thousands of businesses a cost of between $25,000 and $40,000, particularly for family businesses. It knows that that is an enormous extra burden. If the ACCI knows that this is going to result in an extra cost for its constituency, why is it that it came before the committee and supported the small-large test?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether this group knows who they represent. Maybe they have had too many long lunches as lobbyists in Canberra. Maybe they have not gone out and consulted their constituents. I would say that it is more likely that they are not sure whether they represent small business or large business. They seem to be torn between the two. This legislation is not going to affect large business. If you are one of the thousands of small businesses or family companies in this country, you have been poorly represented by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They tried to play a double game before the committee. They have betrayed small business. The small business members of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry really have to question their membership in this organisation and they have to do that very soon because their membership fees are not cheap. They have to support a very large complex down the road and support the many lobbyists who have very lucrative salaries and have very good lunches. This is done using the membership fees of small business members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt that they have become technocrats and bound by the Canberra lobbyists' philosophy. They got totally sucked in by the government leading up to this committee meeting. It was the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and representatives from his office who went to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and said, `Don't complain about the bill. Don't go to the opposition. Don't talk to the opposition because we will adjust it to your particular liking.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the time the legislation hit the Senate the government had dumped them. Why would they not? This government has always dumped small business. It has often lied to the Australian public and it has done exactly the same to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. You would have thought that experienced lobbyists would have realised that, but they got hooked and then came running to those of us on this side of house at the very last minute so we could try to get them out of the fat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone got to them again. Maybe it was the government. By the time they rolled up to the committee hearing they had changed their views again. If anyone sees their submission, and they will, and if anyone sees the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the evidence before the committee, and they will, they will know that those representatives were equivocal, weak and unrepresentative of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They cannot go around pretending that they represent small business when they concede that there is a new expense for small business because of this new regime. No thanks to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, small business is going to be subjected to an almighty extra audit fee in coming years. I think they ought to have a close look at who represents them. Maybe they should start looking at COSBOA, which seems to me to be a far better representative body. </PARA>

The Port Hedland council has invited Mr Justice Kirby to visit the town. I wholeheartedly endorse that invitation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move on and talk about another element in the bill, and that is the government's action to stop repeat applications by people in detention who have failed to gain refugee status in order to gain protection in this country. They go through a series of court actions, come back, lodge a further application and go through the review process again. It is not before time that the government or the parliament is changing this to stop what I believe has been in some cases an abuse of the system. I did qualify my remarks by saying `in some cases'. There is the need, as is accommodated in the bill, for the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to have an ability in certain circumstances to allow a person to make a repeat application for a protection visa in Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there will be people in our society who will yet again criticise the government because of the contents of this bill. I will ask those people to legitimise themselves before they make any criticism. I want to explain my remarks by going through an experience I had last month when I visited Port Hedland and its detention centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard of how people can be psychologically damaged in detention centres. I have no doubt that that may be the case in some instances. I witnessed one individual being psychologically damaged. It was not because of the actions of the minister or the department, and it had nothing to do with this parliament, but it was because of the actions of a migration agent who was purportedly representing one of the detainees in Port Hedland. Obviously I will not name names here now, but I would hope that those people, when they come out and criticise the government or criticise me, in turn will criticise this very prominent migration agent for their efforts on behalf of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The individual had been in detention for quite some time. He had previously had an application for protection refused, his appeal was refused and he then joined in a number of legal actions, both at the state level and through the Federal Court, which were all unsuccessful. He then started on the treadmill yet again by applying, with the assistance of the agent, for a protection visa, which application failed. He then lodged an appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal. In a matter of days before the individual and his agent were to appear before the tribunal, the agent sent a message through to the applicant to say that he was not going to be represented any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that a despicable act. Here you have this person whose hopes had been built up again and again&mdash;in some cases by direct lies, untruths&mdash;by being told he might have the opportunity to get refugee status in Australia when clearly he had been rejected quite a number of times on the merits of the case. Yet, at the death knock, at the final hour, the person who had propped the individual up on the way through pulled the props away and left him floundering. He was floundering, and his application to the RRT failed. He did not go to the tribunal hearing alone. There were people who went along, held his hand and provided him with some support, although they could not support the argument that could have been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take a pretty hard line on illegal entries to this country. I do not think there is anybody in this chamber who would deny that. But at least my line is honest. I do not stoop to the depths that people like the particular agent I am referring to did when he let that poor unfortunate individual down in the way the individual was let down. I think that is despicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the agent, who undoubtedly will read this speech, will recognise whom I am talking about and will seek to repair the damage they have done. The best thing they could probably do would be to remove themselves completely from this area of migration policy and not to involve themselves in it in any shape or form again. I hope the individual migration agent concerned would do that. If I find that they do not, perhaps I will come into this place and use the privilege of the parliament to protect some of the illegal entrants to this country in a way that would provide proper protection to them, not the sort of protection that that particular agent gave. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (6.13 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliament is discussing the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). In substance, the bill seeks to retrospectively authorise the detention of asylum seekers and to remove the right of detainees to obtain reasonable compensation for unlawful detention by limiting compensation to $1 per day, which could almost be classified as contemptuous compensation. I and the Australian Democrats believe that this bill should be rejected by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government first introduced this bill, it was obviously a reaction to the then likely determination of the High Court that the government's attempt to limit compensation to $1 per day for unlawful detention was neither fair, just nor reasonable. The bill, at that stage, certainly offended the principle of separation of powers, which requires that the executive government should not intervene in the judicial process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was also examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The committee heard evidence, amongst other points that were placed before it, that the legislation could contravene section 31 of the constitution as an acquisition of property through the denial of compensation following a tort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from concerns with its constitutional validity, the attempts by the Commonwealth to remove itself from the jurisdiction of the courts is, in the Democrats' view, an inappropriate use of the privilege it has as part of the legislative process. If the Commonwealth believes that it is not liable it should defend the matter in the courts, not change the law. The removal of the common law right through retrospective legislation is simply not acceptable. The dicta of the High Court in previous instances in which retrospective legislation has been acceptable are those in which no parties were disadvantaged, their liberties undermined or their rights abused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the broad-ranging consensus in evidence before the committee that the bill may be unconstitutional, it does not achieve the government's stated desire of limiting costly court proceedings. I would venture to guess that a High Court challenge is almost inevitable should the bill be passed and that therefore this bill does not provide an adequate resolution of the situation. I know the statement has been made that the government will now be able to pursue a settlement out of court, but it seems to me that the people at the other end of that negotiation process do not have a lot of leverage when the government has been able to get through this parliament a bill which limits the damages to a contemptuous $1 a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the point that the bill this time around will only be passed because the coalition parties have decided that they will now support it. I think it might be instructive if we look at some of the pronouncements that were made by coalition representatives at a time when they had decided on legal, moral, and constitutional grounds that this bill should be opposed. I quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 9 November 1994 where Senator Short said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also breaches several basic principles of law. It condones the proposition that, wherever unlawful administrative action has been taken, the parliament may retrospectively act to cure it. If we accept that proposition, that would, as the Law Council of Australia has said, `destroy or at least significantly diminish the Commonwealth administrative law system'.</PARA>
<PARA>A little further down the page he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite certain that, if this bill were passed, it would be challenged in the High Court. Legal advice indicates that such a challenge would very likely be successful.</PARA>
<PARA>Again a little further down in the same speech Senator Short said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition does not believe, however, that considerations of this nature, unfortunate though they may be&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that refers to the High Court challenge&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should be permitted to override the fundamental objections to this flawed bill, with its breaches of basic principles of law and with all its damaging implications for the future processes of and confidence in our legal system.</PARA>
<PARA>There is more. On the same day, at page 2715 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, Senator O'Chee said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government comes before this parliament and asks it to rubber stamp its illegal and unprincipled actions, but when Australians are unlawfully detained in another country this same government seeks a different standard from that country.</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't it somewhat surprising that, having said all those things based on legal advice and based on evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the coalition now says, `Well, there is a lot of money involved. We must ensure that the budget deficit does not grow. We must save money. So we will throw out all those principles that protect our legal system; all those principles that go to the separation of powers; all those principles that go to the basic argument that a government in a court should be no better off than a citizen; that it should not go away from the court when it receives or fears an unfavourable judgment and say, "Well, I think I am going to lose so I will quickly run into parliament and get the law changed."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That very basic principle is being contravened by the government and now, I am sad to say, by the coalition. I hope that they can live with their consciences. The Australian Democrats strongly oppose this bill and will be voting against it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the government has acted on advice. This has been a difficult issue for the parliament to grapple with, but it is symptomatic of issues in migration. Anyone who comes into this area thinking that there will not be a continuing demand for bills to amend legislation has no appreciation of the area. This area is very much influenced by events which are not in the control of Australia, in many respects, and also events which are not within the control of the parliament. The courts have a very innovative way of interpreting the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these factors will ensure that for the foreseeable future there will also be a number of migration bills going through this parliament every year. That has been the nature of it since the legislation was codified some six or seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, this issue has been difficult. From the start the government has been keen to ensure that the people involved do not get a windfall benefit. As a consequence, we took the initial measure and the second measure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just rise to put on the public record what the Greens have said all along in relation to migration matters that are considered in this bill. What we have before us is wrong upon wrong upon wrong. Initially, the government started wrongly by trying to prevent access to the High Court by a group of asylum seekers who were claiming to have been illegally detained. My first venture into the debate in this chamber was to put on the public record some kind of protest against the action of both the government and the opposition. That wrong, which happened to prevent access to the court by certain asylum seekers, left a tiny window of opportunity&mdash;where the court found that those who had been detained before we made that unforgivable and indefensible law part of this parliament&mdash;for those people who had been found by the court to have been illegally detained to obtain some compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The next wrong was in December 1992&mdash;on the 17th, as I remember it&mdash;when, in order to reduce that window of opportunity for those people who had already had their rights denied by this parliament, the government decided to reduce the compensation they could claim for their illegal detention to $1 a day. We had one chink of light last year when the opposition expressed its repugnance of retrospectivity in the way in which it voted against this measure. Certainly, many of us felt that a progressive stance was being demonstrated&mdash;instead of what we have been experiencing now for as many years as I have been in this place, of bipartisan inhumanity or a political monoculture that refuses to look at the human rights violations that we are perpetrating by legislation in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994 contains four main amendments and consequential amendments related to the indexation provisions proposed in the three other bills. The main provisions of this bill are, firstly, to restructure the Refugee Review Tribunal by creating positions of deputy principal member and senior members from within the existing prescribed establishment; secondly, to amend the arrangements for the cancellation of certain business skills visas; thirdly, to provide for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of all members of the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal; and, fourthly, to grant additional entitlements to applicants engaged in the Immigration Review Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three bills, other than the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, are solely designed to enable the automatic indexation of migration agents registration levies and the English language charge payable under the Migration Act. The indexation of user fees and charges is designed to maintain, in real terms, the relative contributions of service users and the taxpayer in accordance with budget policy. As such, they seem to the coalition to be relatively uncontroversial in nature, although some aspects in terms of the relationship between the Senate and the other place may need to be looked at later in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the more substantive parts of the bill. I turn first of all to the restructuring of the Refugee Review Tribunal. The creation of the new positions of deputy principal member and senior members of the Refugee Review Tribunal from within the existing prescribed establishment, which is up to 100 members, is apparently designed to create a more hierarchical structure for the RRT and to spread some of the current leadership and administrative responsibilities of the principal member. The new hierarchical structure proposed is more in line with that of the Immigration Review Tribunal, which basically has similar positions to the ones now being created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has provided scant justification for the need for the restructuring of positions on the Refugee Review Tribunal. The only argument that has been brought forward is that they enhance the hierarchical structure of the body. The changes are said to have no financial impact. However, following furthering questioning of the department on this point&mdash;and this was also raised in estimates committee hearings&mdash;it came out that the phrase `no financial impact' refers to forward estimate projections which are already quoted to account for more members than the RRT actually has. In the committee stage, I will seek further clarification from the minister on exactly what structure he is proposing for the RRT, how many members in total it will have and what it actually means in terms of dollars and cents this year. To say that it has no financial impact I think is misleading. </PARA>

<PARA>We have before the Senate tonight a report from the Australian Research Council and the Higher Education Council which have developed a number of recommendations relating to the benefits of Australia's research effort. I want to put this report in some context. Australia has one of the best records in the OECD of coming up with innovative ideas and leading world research. One of the problems that we have tended to have over the years is moving this research through to the marketplace, where we can gain maximum economic benefit from the outcome. We seem to have had a history of failing to turn innovations into products. Part of the thrust of this report in this changing information age is to bring about a situation where Australia gets a higher level of benefit from what is happening in the marketplace. This is particularly crucial because, as we open up our economy and as the information superhighway develops, it will be very easy for Australian intellectual property to move out of the country and into other countries and for them to benefit economically rather than us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes four recommendations to address this matter. The first one is for the Australian Research Council&mdash;the ARC&mdash;to commission a study to examine the innovative progression gap. That is a problem for researchers. This basically means moving the idea from the stage of a piece of intellectual property through to its further development into the marketplace. I think that move is most welcome. This is of course a preliminary report, and such a study as proposed in recommendation one will set a good foundation for policy in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second recommendation is that the ARC and HEC sponsor a forum for industry researchers and higher education institutions to discuss intellectual property issues. This is very much needed. When I was in America last year, they were discussing a number of the implications of the superhighway, and they saw the real danger that people could lose control of their intellectual property. Not only have trade barriers opened up but also with the new information superhighway intellectual property can move very rapidly across boundaries. People can access databases a lot more easily, and whole loads of information can be moved in the blink of an eye from Australia to some other country. It is very important that we have a very informed discussion on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third recommendation is that the ARC and HEC encourage institutions to offer intellectual property training courses to postgraduate students. Many students, when focusing on getting a higher degree, often do not realise the value commercially of what they are dealing with. In their eagerness to publish papers and establish a recommendation, they often give away things that are of great benefit to this country. We should treat intellectual property like we would treat gold and silver because, in the end, it can have the effect of helping develop our economy further if the rights of the individual doing the research and if the rights of the institution are protected. Research students need to be trained properly to manage this intellectual property. So recommendation No. 3 is most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth recommendation is to encourage institutions to promote and develop academic staff programs on intellectual property, production, management and exploitation in the business context. That is most welcome. But what we need in addition to that is some backup and foundation in this parliament for these intellectual property rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue has not been discussed enough in the parliament. We do not have a proper legislative base to protect this matter. We have protection for things such as paper copy, but in the information age we do not have proper protection for material that is on computers. As I mentioned before, we must not allow people from overseas to profit from our innovations. Australian academics and Australian companies should reap the benefits of our expertise and intellectual property. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way this parliament and other parliaments in the world seem to have been required to respond to rules from the Uruguay Round of GATT has protected the rights of corporations that have funded research. As we push our educational structures to be more and more commercial, even though the general public pays back a 150 per cent tax deduction to corporations that require universities to conduct research for them, the corporations become the owners of the intellectual property. So we are not protecting the rights of those people who have developed the ideas. We have certainly not protected the rights of those people who may have come up with the ideas when in another country a corporation has patented a similar idea at an earlier stage. Therefore, all the outcome from thereon comes from the development of that idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are doing, in most cases unknowingly, is developing a system which mitigates against the transfer of ideas and science. Science requires the intellectual exercise of moving, checking and having your papers checked.

<PARA>This report deals with a collision between a Malaysian air force aircraft and an aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force at Butterworth on 13 October at the end of last year. The board of inquiry and the accident investigation team of the Royal Australian Air Force both agreed that the action was due to an error of judgment. Both pilots failed to take avoiding action early enough to avoid collision. It was determined that the pilots were appropriately qualified, that the mission had been well briefed and conducted in accordance with relevant orders and instructions, and that all manoeuvres flown by both pilots before impact had been conducted in a professional and competent manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time we have had mid-air collisions between aircraft in the air force. Unfortunately, we will go on having them. The nature of the training regime in air combat manoeuvring is really quite violent and very realistic. The tolerance for error is absolutely minimal. When there are aircraft at closing speeds of probably up to 1,200 miles per hour, things happen with great rapidity. In recent years, we have had the odd unfortunate collision in this country, particularly since the introduction of the FA18, with its far higher manoeuvrability than the Mirage, which it replaced. Careful planning and good training will reduce the number of those incidents, but it will never entirely eliminate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final paragraph&mdash;paragraph 4&mdash;talks about the actions arising from the investigation. I will quote the first sentence of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the recommendations resulting from the investigation and the executive review process, a number of measures related to improved training programs and currency requirements for pilots engaging in air combat training are to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>That does not sit well with the conclusion in paragraph 3 in relation to the investigation, which is that the mission had been well briefed and conducted in accordance with relevant orders and that all manoeuvres, et cetera, had been conducted in a professional and competent manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is the inclusion in the fourth paragraph that currency requirements for pilots engaging in air combat training are to be implemented. They found that the accident was due to an error of judgment. Judgment is something that has to be exercised constantly. Anyone who has learnt to fly can fly an aeroplane as long as they are physically able to. To fly to the degree of precision and anticipation that is  required in air combat manoeuvring exercises does require constant practice and frequency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a concern for quite a number of years that reducing the defence budget year after year has meant that training has been curtailed in all three services. It is particularly acute in the case of the air force. I do not know for what number of hours pilots are flying in the FA18 or the F111 fleets, but it is probably in the order of about 17 or 18 hours per month. Arguably, it probably should be around 24 or even 26 hours per month. While it might seem that an hour or two does not make much difference, it really does when you are asking people to fly at the limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My mind goes back to a report tabled in this parliament a few months ago which dealt with the loss of an F111 at the Guyra bombing range. The aircraft flew into the ground. The aircraft was destroyed and both crew members were killed. It turned out that the crew of that aircraft were tasked for what was the most difficult operation you could ask an F111 crew to do, which is a low-level night strike in appallingly bad weather. It turned out that they had not flown on a similar operation at night for two or four months. I wonder whether the currency requirements were fully met in that case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a heavy heart that tonight I stand to address the Senate because tomorrow there will take place the funeral of young Peter Savage. Peter, you will recall, was the Trinity schoolboy who was stabbed as he walked home from football practice last week. I did not know him personally but I am part of the same family, part of the Trinity school family. All I have heard from that family is that Peter was a very decent, pleasant, easygoing and popular young man. His death was a great loss to the school and to the community but most particularly, of course, to his own family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter was described by the headmaster of Trinity as `a gentle giant'. My son Matthew is a student of Trinity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most murders are senseless, but probably none more so than this&mdash;a fine young man who was struck down in his prime, with no apparent motive. There was some doubt about robbery or jealousy but certainly there was a strong element of thuggery. It clearly is not safe to walk on our streets any more. The criminologists tell us that the statistics show that crime rates are down. I think that just confirms the old saying that there are lies, damned lies and statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the real world there is real concern, even fright and in some cases terror, about our society. The academic criminologists should come down from their ivory towers and listen to the people in the real world. It is one of the great sadnesses in our society that we are no longer safe in our own houses or in our streets. Peter was attacked just 500 metres from his own home at 6.30 in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the solution that we must face to stop fine, decent young men like this from being attacked? It may be that heavier punishments are needed, but surely the most important thing is the certainty that the perpetrators will be caught. The most stringent punishment is no use by itself; we need to be fairly certain that we will catch the criminals. That means more resources for police, it means more police on the front line and more police on the beat&mdash;genuine policemen rather than those who are pen pushing and paper writing. I have to say at this point that in spite of the royal commission in New South Wales I have a high regard for the majority of police in New South Wales. They do a very good job under very difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to many views, I believe we should start with the minor crimes and vandalisms, which are the breeding ground for the thugs and criminals in our society. We must ensure that there is a high probability of these thugs and criminals being caught. The problem is so real and so worrying that Rod West, the headmaster of Trinity Grammar School, for whom I have the highest regard, had even before this incident issued a warning in the headmaster's monthly bulletin regarding just this sort of situation&mdash;boys being attacked on their way home from school. Surely nobody except those living in ivory towers would have doubted the problem before this incident. Certainly after the events of the last week there can be no doubt at all about the magnitude and seriousness of this problem. </PARA>

There was no robbery as a motive. His jaw was fractured, his nose was fractured and his eyesight was damaged, hopefully only temporarily. Joel Campbell, my nephew, is one of the most fine and decent young men I know. His family I hold in the highest possible regard. They represent everything that is good and decent in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where did this vicious attack take place? In the back streets or alleys of Sydney or Melbourne? This took place in Sale in Gippsland, not a place you would think of in terms of this sort of violent assault.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our job here in parliament is to ensure that the senseless waste of the lives of fine young men like Peter Savage does not happen again.

That is what we in this place and others around Australia must seek to achieve. My heart goes out to Peter's family, to his mother Meryl and father Reg, to his brother Leon&mdash;who, in particular, has been a great source of strength to his family and friends&mdash;and to his brothers Jonathon and Benjamin.

<SPEECH PAGE="712" SPEAKER="Coulter Sen J.R." NAMEID="TF4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> ((7.10 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening I began a speech, which I want to continue tonight, in relation to the protection of the headwaters of the Great Australian Bight as a Great Australian Bight marine park. I was making the point that this necessarily involves both the state of South Australia, which has control of the waters out to the three mile limit, and the Commonwealth, which controls the waters from there out to the 200 nautical mile limit. The importance of this area lies in the fact that it is a very diverse region. It is the breeding ground for the southern right whale, or at least approximately 50 per cent of the southern right whales that breed around the coastline of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went on to point out that, in addition, South Australia has an extremely poor record with respect to the protection of its marine environment, having only 1.4 per cent of its waters in marine parks, compared with some 20 and 25 per cent in Western Australia and Queensland respectively. I had also pointed out that there was more unique biodiversity in the southern temperate waters of Australia than there was in the tropical regions and that only about 10 per cent of the species in the northern parts of Australia, where most of our marine parks are sited, are unique to Australia, whereas in the case of the southern area, some 80 per cent of those species are unique to Australia. I was also pointing out that this proposed marine park at the head of the bight also had 21 breeding colonies for the rare Australian sea lions and that this was some 10 per cent of the world's population of sea lions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth of Australia has national and global responsibilities for protecting biodiversity and ensuring the sustainable use of resources and also protecting endangered marine animals such as the endangered southern right whale and the rare Australian sea lion&mdash;for instance, the threatened species legislation, the national cetacean action plan and the national seal action plan being drawn up by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency. Under the Commonwealth's Ocean Rescue 2000 program, the National Ecologically Sustainable Development Strategy and the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity, Australia and South Australia through the intergovernmental agreement on the environment are committed to the establishment of a national representative system of marine protected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was making when I broke off last night was that while both the Commonwealth and the state have called for a study to be carried out, and that study has been carried out, for some peculiar and inexplicable reason the minister responsible in the South Australian parliament is keeping the result of that study under wraps&mdash;is not revealing it either to the public or to the Commonwealth&mdash;yet the Commonwealth was evidently a party to the study. I think it is something that the Commonwealth should be inquiring into very quickly, particularly in view of the fact that it seems that South Australia is moving very deliberately towards an exclusive representation in its marine research area on commercial interests and not on environmental protection interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposal for the marine park at Head of Bight&mdash;this is the smaller proposal that the South Australian government seems to be putting&mdash;only 552 square kilometres or 6.4 per cent of the total exclusion zone will be excluded all year round from extractive exploitative activities such as fishing and mining. Both these activities have been clearly demonstrated, through research studies, to cause disturbance to whales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fishing industry and the Department of Mines and Energy want access to this area for six months of the year for commercial fishing and mineral and petroleum exploration when the whales are not present. The point I was stressing, also, was that this was totally inadequate because this smaller part needed to be totally protected. It also is an area which is recognised as not prospective for oil. Only a very tiny proportion of South Australia's total fishing stocks come from this area. This area, known as the sanctuary zone in the South Australian Research Development Industry draft management plan, represents the key area where the whales congregate, breed and calve at Head of Bight and move along the Nullarbor cliffs. The key issue is that this is their critical habitat and needs to be protected all year round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The marine park area not only has poor prospectivity for mineral and petroleum activity, but commercial fishing activity is minimal. On average, less than one per cent of the southern rock lobster in the western waters of South Australia is caught within the marine park area. As far as the bluefin tuna, the other species caught in that general area, is concerned, it is migratory and could be caught beyond the limits of the park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SARDI, the agency contracted by the Commonwealth through the Australian Nature Conservation Agency to produce the management plan for the marine park, was withdrawn from the project by the South Australian Minister for Primary Industries in February 1995 before it had completed its contractual obligations. The original project was funded in 1992 by the Commonwealth on the express condition that South Australia proclaim the multiple use Great Australian Bight Marine Park in the near future. This was agreed to in a letter to the Commonwealth by the then government of South Australia, and namely by the then minister for environment, Susan Lenehan, and the Minister for Fisheries, Lyn Arnold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the point I wanted to stress in my speeches last night and tonight, that this was a clear undertaking on the part of the South Australian government. As a consequence, the Commonwealth, together with the state, funded this study carried out by SARDI. The South Australian government has unilaterally withdrawn SARDI from the study and the result of that study is being kept under wraps by the South Australian minister, and not being released to the parliament or the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been extensive consultation on this draft management plan with key interest groups. Consultation on the park started in early 1993. The 16-person Great Australian Bight Marine Park Management Plan Advisory Committee was specifically established in February 1994 to facilitate input on the draft plan. Non-government representatives on this committee included people from local tourism, commercial fisheries, recreational fisheries, conservation, local government, Aboriginal communities and people with cetacean expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government representatives included those from SARDI, the convenor/planning officer, national parks, Mines and Energy and the subdepartment of Fisheries from Primary Industries. The advisory committee has formally met on three occasions to consider, comment and make recommendations on the various drafts of the management plan. Two colour information pamphlets have been produced for public distribution by SARDI on the Great Australian Bight Marine Park proposal. They contain information on what are marine parks, the conservation and economic value of the Great Australian Bight, proposed boundaries of the park and information on the planning process. They contain no information on the proposed zones. The Minister for Primary Industries has requested that these pamphlets not be publicly distributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the extensive planning, consultation and preparation of the draft plan, no official reason has ever been given by the Minister for Primary Industries in South Australia or the office of the Premier of Cabinet regarding SARDI's removal from the marine park project. The minister responsible for declaring marine parks is also the Minister for Fisheries and Mines and Energy. This has been a major conflict of interest, which has resulted in his reticence to support the marine park, despite the support from the minister for the environment. I will complete this speech on an another occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to draw to the attention of the Senate the failure of Labor's road policy in northern New South Wales&mdash;a failure that is continuing even to this day. The genesis of most of the problem goes back to a time when the Wran government from 1976 to 1988 showed a total disregard for the need to develop roads. Members of the Senate will remember those famous photos near Darling Harbour where an expressway system was left suspended in mid-air during the period of the Wran government because they did not think they should complete such roads in inner city areas. Fortunately, the Greiner government completed it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the greatest area of neglect&mdash;and Senator Campbell is going to discover this on his northern road tour for youth in northern New South Wales next week&mdash;is the Pacific Highway, which is the major link road between Sydney and Brisbane. The Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, was in the area recently. He totally neglected in his speeches to mention the lack of progress by his government on this highway over the 13 years that federal Labor has been funding roads. He tried to make out&mdash;particularly to the voters in that area, as we are in the process of coming up to an election&mdash;what a great job Labor is doing. But you have only to look, particularly in the lower Hunter region, at the neglected roads to see the reality. I am sure the voters who have to travel over those roads will not be fooled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the example of the announcement by Minister Brereton of the link of the F3 Freeway to the Pacific Highway near Hexham. It is interesting that he announced this road project; the project has been under way for 18 months. Why is he up there announcing it? It is under way. What he did then was worse because he went on to make an announcement about the Kurri bypass to link up to the New England Highway west of Branxton. That had also been announced several years ago and the government had put a timetable on it&mdash;a timetable which the minister then removed. We believe he removed that because of the costs of completing this link into Hexham. In other words, that road has taken a back priority and the lower Hunter will have to suffer the high demand for the roads from coal trucks that travel through the areas, including my home town of Maitland, until this road is built, which probably will not be for another 15 to 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also came up with a number of cheap solutions to some of the problems. One was the announcements of traffic lights and photos of a lady kissing Bob Horne because he had announced this set of traffic lights. This was a cheap and nasty solution to a very major problem that required a flyover. It exemplifies what Labor has done for roads in the lower Hunter and in the electorate of Paterson, because the solutions are cheap and nasty or involve no expenditure at all. I think the member, Bob Horne, should be extremely worried about this. As the people travel over these roads, they are going to remember this Labor government's very poor record in this area. To make matters worse, Mr Horne's record also indicates to us in this parliament that he has voted for higher fuel charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Higher fuel charges, one would think, are turned back into roads. But, as I will show in a minute, that does not happen. The motorists in the lower Hunter, as in many other areas of Australia, get the worst of both worlds. They get higher charges on their fuel and the government does not spend the money on the roads. In a speech in the House of Representatives adjournment debate on 7 September 1993, Mr Horne had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increased fuel excise will add about 2.3 per cent to the cost of running his vehicle. Do not get me wrong, Mr Speaker; I do not want to justify increases at all.</PARA>
<PARA>If he did not want to justify the increases, he obviously did not believe in them. If he did not believe in them, why didn't he vote against them? I have the voting record here, which shows Mr Horne voted for those rises in fuel taxes in his area. I would like to point out to the voters of Paterson that they have a member who puts up their road charges and does not match that with the necessary expenditure in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area in the north that has particularly bad records on roads is the area up around Kempsey. Senators will recall that back in 1989 there was an horrific bus smash at Kempsey. The government, at that point in time, brought in a road black spot program. The government promised $1 billion to take action to prevent such things happening in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have a look at what happened in the budget succeeding that crash, the government did spend a lot of money in the first year. The second year after the crash the money dropped substantially. The third year after the crash it dropped even further. The fourth year after the crash it disappeared altogether. In other words, the issue had lost the consciousness of the public and what happened was that spending was cut. What does this government have to wait for before it spends the appropriate amount of money on roads&mdash;another Kempsey road smash?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a smash is quite possible, because the problems that existed in 1989 still exist on that road today. That road poses some risk to the general public&mdash;and next week it will pose some risk to senators on this side of the chamber who will be travelling on that road up the coast. Next week Senator Campbell will see the problems in that area. A number of other members and senators that I took on our black spots road trip of northern New South Wales travelled up many sections of this road and saw how poor the funding was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is surprising that we do have such poor funding&mdash;surprising because of the amount of money that is raised in this country from motorists to fix the very problems that I have indicated. In 1983-84, there was 6.9c per litre spent on roads. This was money that was taken out of the fuel excise&mdash;6.9c per litre&mdash;on every litre sold in Australia for expenditure on roads. That was at the start of this Labor government. In 1994-95, 11 years later, 4.3c per litre was spent on the roads. That is a fall of a third in dollar values, but in real terms it is a much more significant drop. Yet the roads are in such terrible condition. It is really up to this government to change its priorities and make sure that it does spend a proper level of funding on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around 3,000 lives are lost each year on roads in Australia. If 3,000 people are killed in a foreign war, it becomes a major international headline. Imagine if tomorrow, in places like Bosnia, 3,000 civilians were killed. There would be headlines around the world. Yet this happens every year in Australia, and a lot of it happens because of the very poor conditions of our roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It behoves the government not only to do something about the roads to save lives but also to make the economy far more efficient. We have a government that claims it believes in micro-economic reforms. Yet probably one of the most significant micro-economic reforms you could make in this country is to improve the road system. It would drop the use of fuel, it would stop vehicles wearing out. People would work more efficiently because they would get to their destinations sooner. If you did a real economic cost benefit study on it, you would find that the money spent on roads repays itself again and again in greater efficiency and in lower health costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have a short-sighted government that only looks to the next election. It can only see out eight months to another election. It is not taking the long-term view and it is not really implementing proper micro-economic reform. That is not only a tragedy for our economy but also a tragedy for the many families who lose loved ones on Australia's grossly inadequate road system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to the adjournment debate tonight is to make some comments by way of condolences on the passing of Ted Whitten, the great player, coach and administrator of the great game of Australian rules football. Ted Whitten, at the age of 62, lost a very long battle with cancer some 13 days ago. Many millions of people around Australia, including your good self, Mr President, who follow Australian rules football, of course, were very sad at his passing but share the pride of Ted's valiant battle with cancer. No Australian who saw the  coverage of Ted's farewell to football at the last state of origin game would be anything but deeply moved and proud of such a great Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not lived all my life in an Australian rules football state. I spent a lot of my youth in Queensland and grew up with codes such as rugby league and rugby union and, indeed, only ever played one game of Australian rules football at primary school in Brisbane. The fact I only played one game is some comment on my ability to play that game. I achieved slightly higher achievements in the game of rugby union. When I moved to Perth in 1975, I had to learn all about Australian rules football because it got no coverage in Brisbane where I spent most of my youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say I found it very hard to follow on television and it was not until I went to a derby between South Fremantle and East Fremantle and saw the game played on the paddock, as H.G. and Roy describe it, that I could get the concept of a game that did not seem to have any off-side rule in place. I must admit at the beginning of my contribution that I do not have any deep understanding of Aussie rules as people who would have lived in Victoria would have, such as my colleague Senator Rod Kemp, who sits beside me here; yourself, Mr President; and other people who have lived in Western Australia, Victoria or South Australia where the game has been played for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The game of Australian rules is truly Australian. It was developed just south of the emerging city of Melbourne many decades ago&mdash;in fact, over 100 years ago&mdash;and reflects, I think it is fair to say, as my leader, John Howard, said at a private dinner the other night, an incredible egalitarian ethos. They were not his words. He said that it is a game that truly crosses all spectra of society. You can go to any ground around Australia on any given Saturday or Sunday afternoon and see multimillionaires, political leaders, heads of the judiciary, heads of the Public Service and people from all walks of life from all sorts of ethnic backgrounds enjoying what is one of the truly great games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Whitten has been more responsible than virtually any other person in the history of the game for the development of the game, particularly at the state of origin level. I think it is fair to say that his incredible efforts in developing the state of origin game have led to the broadening of the VFL into AFL&mdash;a truly national competition. I say `truly' because, I must say, Senator Kemp, a state outside Victoria has won the flag twice in the last few years. I think it is fair to say that Ted Whitten deserves enormous credit for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ted Whitten, of course, came to be known as Mr Football&mdash;obviously the ultimate accolade in his generation. He has been variously described by media as the `complete player', `wonderfully skilled' and `as tough as nails'. As a player he rose to fame through his beloved Footscray, a club that he then went on to coach after playing 321 games for that team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He originally came from the suburban streets of Braybrook in Melbourne, but through all of his success quite clearly never lost the common touch. Many anecdotes surround Ted Whitten; many of them have been referred to in media commentary before and after his sad passing. But one of the ones that touched me is the anecdote about Ted's regular path on foot from his home to the game at the Western oval where he would be dressed in a three-piece suit, doffing his hat to ladies as he passed them on the street&mdash;something that would be fascinating to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opponents say that he was a very hard, tough player, uncompromising, the sort of player who would break your nose out on the ground but then after the game take you to hospital and then, after you had been to hospital, go out for a drink with you. It reminds me of some of the attributes of this place from time to time, even though there probably should be a bit more of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ted went on to be a chairman of selectors for the Victorian team and, as I said earlier, was the driving force for state of origin football. I gained an enormous enjoyment from state of origin football, particularly the games I have been to at Subiaco oval. Indeed, many millions of Australians have probably been attracted to the game because of the incredible state rivalry and the intensity of competition on the ground that was developed because of those games. I am sure, like myself, many people have been attracted to the game because of those events that owe so much to Ted and his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After his role in football he went on to become a very colourful commentator and he was, clearly, a very colourful character away from football. Particularly in the latter few months and years he provided an incredible inspiration for Australians whether they followed Australian rules football or not. He was well known amongst his friends as not only a great lover of the big V and the Bulldogs but also very much as a devoted family man. It is said that no Saturday passed that he did not bring flowers home to his wife, Val, and young Ted or Ted junior, himself a distinguished player for Footscray, put it very succinctly at the state funeral last week when he described his father as his hero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who did not have the pleasure of meeting Ted Whitten, I made efforts to contact someone who I knew did know him. That was someone from Western Australia in the name of Simon Beasley, a great player for Swan Districts, who then went on to play for Footscray and, indeed in the history of Footscray, having kicked 574 goals, is the leading goal kicker for that team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to Simon about his recollections of Ted and the influence that he had on Simon's life so that I could gain a personal insight into Ted. Simon informed me this morning that at his first game against Essendon at Windy Hill he had actually been held goalless. I am sure Simon had gone across for his first big game in the VFL expecting to do better than that. But his next game the weekend after was against Collingwood, I think at the Western oval. Simon's very first goal in the VFL was scored because young Ted kicked him a drop punt which landed on Simon's not unimpressive chest and went through to score the first of those 574 goals in the VFL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simon also told me that Ted's influence on Footscray was almost divine. He told me of a slightly more light-hearted incident regarding the post-1985 season trip to America that the team took where, unfortunately, the behaviour of the team on the flight saw Qantas eject them at Honolulu. Ted just happened to be holidaying there with Val at the time. Simon said that Ted's counselling of the younger players particularly in the team had helped them to pull themselves back together and ensure that, sooner or later, they actually did find an airline that would fly them back to Australia which ensured that Footscray was indeed able to compete in the 1986 season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that he was truly a great Australian, a great administrator, a great coach, a great inspiration&mdash;someone that has been lost at a relatively young age after having made an incredible contribution to Australian sport.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I will be brief in my remarks but, seeing as you are in the chair this evening, I thought the opportunity perhaps should not be missed for me to make a few very brief comments&mdash;I hope that you will accept them in a constructive manner&mdash;on aspects of rulings in the Senate in recent days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak as one who was warned by you, I think, earlier last week. I do not deny, in any sense, that if one makes some robust comments across the chamber the presiding officer does have a role and a duty to bring order. I think you will note that, on the receipt of the warning from you, you did not have cause again to raise that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even allowing for any personal bias one may have about the judgments of one's own behaviour, I have to say that in the debate today on the censure motion of Senator Gareth Evans there were many members on the other side of the chamber who persistently called out, interjected and were spoken to by you on a number of occasions, but none, of course, were warned. That did cause me concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure I speak for a number of my colleagues when I say that the warning you were able to proffer to me&mdash;and should, I believe, in the sense of ensuring that similar standards are applied, which I am sure you believe there should be&mdash;should have been applied to at least two members of the front bench of the government party. I record with you my concern on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I wish to raise is one which has interested me for some time. You will have noted that from the points of order I occasionally make. I think it is an important issue. It regards the rulings of relevance. Standing orders are clear that answers have to be relevant. On previous occasions, I have looked very closely at the rulings of speakers and presiding officers in chambers right around Australia. I would say that there was a very big distinction between what happened in this parliament, principally in the lower house, and rulings in other parliaments. I am happy to supply you with copies of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many presiding officers have been able to rule on relevance. I agree that there will always be a grey area. No-one, least of all me, wants to stop robust debate in this chamber, but clearly it is possible to rule on relevance. I would suggest that, from what I have seen from the rulings of presiding officers, particularly in state parliaments but also some of the rulings by former Senator Sibraa, it is possible to rule on relevance. It is also possible to ensure that ministers, at least within a reasonable framework, stick within the ambit of the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always felt that the problem in the lower house was simply that the Speaker there felt he could not rule on relevance. My understanding and my memory are that he would say, `This is an issue which should be referred to the relevant committee and some attempt made for the parliament to address that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does seem to me that a lot of the behaviour that has occurred in the lower house results from the failure of the Speaker to effectively rule on the relevance of answers. Answers become an opportunity for an open slather attack on the political opponents of the government. It is a pity if a presiding officer finds it difficult to rule on relevance. It does ultimately lead to the sort of behaviour that we see day after day in the lower house. I think the time limit on questions that we have</PARA>
<PARA>in this chamber does impose some restriction. I would be very happy to pull out copies of rulings on relevance that have been made in state parliaments. I would urge you to see whether this particular rule could not be tightened. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to privacy and secrecy provisions, I am unable to comment on the details of individual cases. I am however able to explain when a departure from a child support assessment can be made by a review officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 9 grounds set out in the child support legislation which allow for a departure from a child support assessment. An applicant will only be successful with the departure if he or she has been able to satisfy one or more of the 9 grounds and is able to show that the departure is just and equitable and otherwise proper.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this ground, a review officer would consider whether the capacity of either parent to provide support for a child is significantly reduced because of their commitments in supporting themselves. A review officer would examine the expenses detailed by the applicant and determine what costs are `necessary'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australia has accepted the responsibility for search and rescue for an area of 47,000,000 square kilometres. The search and rescue region extends from longitude 74 degrees east to 163 degrees east and from Antarctica (to 90 degrees south) to the boundaries with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, PNG, the Solomon Islands and Fiji.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia's search and rescue region covers approximately 9 percent of the earth's surface, but this is primarily a consequence of Australia's isolated geographic location. While the area of responsibility is large, it is partially compensated for by the low density of traffic that transits the region. Normally search and rescue regions are allocated by dividing the ocean areas equally between the bordering nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) To provide a full description of all maritime search and rescue operations that the ADF has been involved in, since 1 January 1994, would involve considerable research and I am not prepared to authorise the time and effort entailed. However, the issue of records and statistics for search and rescue operations was discussed in detail in the recent Joint Review of National Maritime and Civil Aviation Search and Rescue Arrangements. The ADF, Airservices Australia and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority are presently working on the development of a common reporting database which will improve the access to detailed statistical data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Australia is a signatory to a number of international conventions that result in the provision of search and rescue services. These include the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue 1979 and the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Under the auspices of these conventions, participating countries accept responsibility for search and rescue operations in their designated areas. In view of the importance the Government places on the safety of human life and its obligations as a signatory to international treaties and conventions, Australia does not pursue cost recovery for humanitarian operations. This is consistent with international practice. Other signatories to the search and rescue conventions not only accept this responsibility but often assist each other in the conduct of search and rescue operations. Australia has in the past regularly received assistance from France, Indonesia, New Zealand and the United States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)-(3), (7), (8) The Department did not purchase obsolete computers. It purchased 55 personal computers (PCs) from IBM  in providing information technology facilities  to Contracted Case Managers (CCMs) under arrangements which are part of the framework announced in Working Nation for delivering services to long-term unemployed people. The PCs were Intel-type 486 machines. They are not `obsolete', but were  incorrectly listed as such in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS> of 7 June 1995. The PCs were new machines purchased under common use contract PE 50 and carry the normal 12 month warranty provided by that contract. The machines were relatively cheap because their configuration (in this case their processing speed and the size of the hard disk drives) was lower than DEET's current standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The PCs will serve the function for which they were purchased for about three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(a) The PCs would normally be disposed of  in about three years as part of the Department's rolling replacement program for  IT infrastructure. The ongoing arrangements for providing IT support to CCMs are, however, subject to further discussion between DEET and ESRA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The PCs will be disposed of through the Department's normal IT equipment disposal processes which follow the guidelines set by the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The expected return from disposal of a PC after three years is about $500 to $700, depending on the configuration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Department purchases only new equipment and all purchases are made from common use contracts under guidelines set by the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA>
