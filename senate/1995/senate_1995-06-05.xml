<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I refer, Minister, to the terms of reference of the inquiry that you have set up since the weekend to look into the failure of the administration of the R&amp;D tax concession scheme. I ask in particular: will this inquiry take into account the bungled guideline for the three other tax concession schemes dating back to 1988 which were not covered by my question last week? What are the sums involved? How many hundreds of millions of dollars are involved in the overall bungling of the four taxation concession schemes? What is the status of applications in the pipeline currently? Will the inquiry address the issue of failure of ministerial oversight?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry to be conducted by Mr Jacobs, a former assistant auditor, will look at all of the issues relating to this matter. Obviously the priority issue to look at is the bungling, as you have referred to it&mdash;what I would call an administrative glitch&mdash;with respect to the financial guideline. The other guidelines that were tabled were in relation to legislation carried last year. But further inquiries by the department over the weekend have led us to conclude that they too should be examined. I make no judgment at this point as to their nature or their legal standing but at least we should examine them and do so thoroughly, and the inquirer will be asked to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of your question goes to sums. The sums involved are purely in the realm of speculation. I said, or at least my Secretary may have said before the estimates committee last Thursday night, that, of the applications disallowed during the period in which the guidelines had been untabled, there were 14 that had been disallowed. They amounted to some $70 million if the total all-up value is taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now advised that, in regard to four of the 14, the disallowance by the IR&amp;D board was related to matters not associated with the financial guideline and that 10 were related to matters associated with the financial guideline. I do not have a figure as to what the total value of that would be, but I can assure the Senate that the legal advice I have is that, while no-one can be absolutely 100 per cent certain about this, nonetheless the very strong likelihood is that there are no financial claims on the Commonwealth. I want to make that very clear. The very strong likelihood is, and this is the legal advice, that there are no financial claims on the Commonwealth, but at this point we cannot be 100 per cent sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the status of the other applications in the pipeline? It is my intention to consider legal advice that the Attorney-General has provided me over the weekend, which my office has received in writing, I am informed, just a few moments ago. I have not read it. I feel an obligation to bring it to the attention of my colleagues at the next cabinet meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oral bottom line&mdash;and I assume this is reflected in the written advice; but this is what I have been given orally&mdash;is essentially that the actions taken by us were reasonable actions to have been taken up to this stage and probably would have solved the matter. The way of putting the matter beyond question is perhaps to bring down a legislative change. That is a matter for consideration and I will release the advice as soon as I have had a chance to draw it to the attention of the cabinet and to consider it myself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of any other applications, the position is that the IR&amp;D board is acting without legal force at this stage. I have suggested to it that it continue meeting, that it consider the applications but not make a decision on them. When it does have legal force and legal power to do so it will then be able to more speedily consider those applications.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will certainly try. Today is World Environment Day. I was able to announce this morning the establishment of a biodiversity conservation program&mdash;a $17 million program&mdash;which will help drive forward the implementation of Australia's national strategy for the conservation of biological diversity. I also would like to advise the Senate today that the Prime Minister has written to all state premiers and chief ministers to invite them to formally sign and adopt the strategy. Only Western Australia has refused to support our biodiversity national strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does regard biodiversity conservation as an important environmental priority because Australia is one of 12 countries that is outstandingly rich in biological diversity, and it is the only developed country in the world to be classified as mega diverse. Biodiversity is also a genetic resource, which provides us with essentials like food, medicines and industrial products. These resources and their relative health also influence and determine rainfall, climate, the productivity of our soils, the ability of the environment to cope with pollution and the delicate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Australia is rich in biodiversity, since 1788 we have lost about 50 per cent of our rainforests, 43 per cent of our forests and 60 per cent of our coastal wetlands in southern and eastern Australia. About 79 plant, 20 mammal and nine bird species have been lost, and 90 per cent of our medium-sized mammals are either extinct, endangered or vulnerable. This type of situation is mirrored right around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with a range of other initiatives already in place, the biodiversity conservation program I have announced today recognises that the protection of our biodiversity can only be achieved cooperatively. The program will provide support for integrated approaches to biodiversity protection, including the implementation of bioregional planning across the country, joint projects with industry and other key stakeholders, incentive programs, and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program also aims to add to the knowledge base on which scientists and decision makers rely and will include the development of an electronic information service called Biolink Australia. Support will also be given to a program of monitoring, allowing species and habitat changes to be measured and quick response solutions to be developed. Community involvement will be encouraged in the areas of information sharing, on-the-ground monitoring, the development of biodiversity education programs and in the establishment of a community biodiversity network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Building on the national wilderness inventory, the program provides $3.9 million to ensure that the Commonwealth actions assist in conserving wilderness areas, and we will also be providing $1.5 million to promote and implement the principles of the biodiversity convention internationally. This program's aim is to develop an integrated understanding&mdash;involving scientists, governments the community and industry&mdash;of the importance of biodiversity protection, both nationally and internationally. It obviously is a very important initiative on the part of the government. I applaud all the state and territory governments, with the exception of Western Australia, who have joined with the Commonwealth to ensure this national strategy is a reality and urge the Western Australian government to do the same. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. In the light of your budget's tax hikes on employers and its predictions that growth rates will not increase above 3.75 per cent throughout the remainder of the decade, how does the government intend to meet its five per cent Working Nation unemployment target by the year 2000&mdash;which, according to the government's own green paper, required growth rates of 4.5 per cent to five per cent for that target to be achieved?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian economy has steady and strong sustainable growth figures. We saw that in the quarterly accounts which came out just last week. You have heard the Treasurer say that we expect the budget forecast for this year to be reached. That is accompanied at the same time by low levels of inflation&mdash;and, in particular, the underlying level of inflation is extremely low. So we have the setting for a continuance of strong growth with low inflation, and, as we have seen, that is accompanied by high levels of job growth&mdash;the last job figures coming down from 8.7 per cent to 8.3 per cent in the last survey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expectation is that with growing exports, particularly in manufacturing areas, with the overcoming of the drought, and with all the other indicators&mdash;the high level of profit that is available for reinvestment, the surplus that we now have in the budget, and the long-term savings plan we have&mdash;the prospect of a figure of five per cent by the end of this century being within the grasp of the Australian economy is true; that is an achievable outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look as well at the most recent international survey of the Australian economy, the OECD survey that was reported in the print media on Friday, I think it is fair to say that, broadly, it endorses all the points that I have made about growth in the economy, the direction of the economy and the level of sustainable improvement in the economy. As a consequence, as I recall, it broadly endorsed the achievement of what we say is there&mdash;the five per cent figure by the end of the decade. For all of those reasons we think it is an achievable figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, if you look at the amount of job creation that has gone on in Australia over the last two years, you can see that we are well ahead of the target that we set ourselves at the last election. At the last election we said we would create half a million new jobs in this term of office. We have already passed that figure, a year before the conclusion of our term. The indications are that we can succeed in lifting that much higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This must be contrasted, of course, with the policy-free zone opposite in which there are no plans or policies on employment and no policies, either, on the issue of managing the economy. In the absence of there being any policy statement whatsoever, one must go back to the record of the coalition when it was in government. That record is high inflation, high unemployment and contracting economic growth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a supplementary question. Do I take it from that that your statement previously, that you needed to have growth rates of 4.5 per cent to five per cent, is inoperative? In other words, what do we make of Mr Keating's statement on 11 February 1993, when he said that the Australian economy has to be able to grow at about four per cent a year and if it does not you cannot bring unemployment down? You were actually at the press conference with him, standing there holding his hand, no doubt. You would have heard him say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any economy that can't travel at four per cent without spilling over into imports should give the game away. We ought to be able to run this economy at four per cent at least, and we'll need to, to bring unemployment down in a sustained, marked way in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>Is this just another case of an expendable promise being thrown out the window? That solemn target is no longer operative; all of a sudden, 3.5 per cent is going to do the trick, just because you could not do any better?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose the answer to that is, you wish, because the opposition seems to want to be the doomsayers of the Australian economy and use its gloomy predictions, as if they were fact, to try to scare the Australian community. The answer to this question is that we are on track for the growth levels predicted in the last budget for this current budgetary period. As I recall, that is about 4.75 per cent. The growth that we are anticipating in the budget we have just brought down is 3 3/4 per cent. We will be around the figure.</PARA></TALK.START>

The minister will be aware of claims by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that the OECD's recently released survey on the Australian economy supports its call for greater labour market reform.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we are aware of certain claims by the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Spicer, reported in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. He is reported as saying that businesses have responded to the `inflexibility' of the Australian industrial relations system by employing part-time workers and casuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say, particularly as minister for small business, is that we have had a very constructive working relationship with the ACCI on many programs. In this particular case, we think Mr Spicer has misunderstood the employment strategies and the labour market in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that part-time employment has been growing since 1978 as more and more workers seek flexible working hours. In December 1994 a survey indicated that over 75 per cent of part-time workers did not want to work more hours&mdash;over three-quarters of the part-time workers in the work force did not want more working hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That these workers, of course, can work the hours they want demonstrates that there is flexibility in the labour market and that they are the main beneficiaries of the flexibility. More and more women are coming into the work force seeking part-time work and they want flexibility in their working conditions to cover their family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, by August 1994 permanent workers still represented over three-quarters of the Australian work force&mdash;over 75 per cent were in full-time employment. So we think Mr Spicer misunderstood what the OECD was commenting about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While he may quibble and others in the opposition may quibble about the OECD report and how it should be interpreted, the OECD report did not mince words when it came to judging this government's policies. The report described the government's Working Nation strategy as `the most comprehensive strategy of active labour market assistance that has ever been attempted in Australia'. Australia's labour market figures, it says, have silenced talk of a jobless recovery. Of course, the opposition wants a jobless recovery. It believes that it can win an election on the misery of others and it wants high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government got the country moving through the One Nation statement and through the Working Nation statement. As is now well known in the community, since the last election over 640,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. We have done that without ripping away the safety net which many of the ideologues in the opposition would love to pull away, including destroying our well-formed labour market and industrial relations system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out the difference between us and America, which the `republicans' in the opposition clearly quote at great length in terms of the American Republican Party. They ought to just remember what the US Labour Secretary, Mr Reich, said last week. He said that the absence of such a safety net as we have in Australia in his own country had generated vast inequalities in income and wealth which in turn threatened the social fabric of his nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, more than anything, indicates by comparison our success in this country. Of course, we do wait with great patience to see any policy coming from the opposition on what it would want to do in employment creation in this country. But I suspect that the policy-free zone in the opposition will continue endlessly until the next election&mdash;and you will pay the penalty as a result!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer the minister to the decision by several home mortgage lenders such as Aussie Home Loans to drop their variable mortgage rates. It seems the major banks are reluctant to follow this, even though the price of funds to them from financial markets has fallen by 0.9 per cent since January. Does the government see this failure of the banks to pass on the benefit of interest rate falls for five months as evidence of a serious market failure? Does the government agree with the finding by the Reserve Bank in its last annual report that the home lending market is not particularly competitive? And, what explanation can the government give to the three million Australian home borrowers as to why their repayments are about $80 a month higher than they would be if the home loans market was truly competitive?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of what Bernie Fraser said in the Reserve Bank report. The answer is that we have a deeper and richer&mdash;richer in the sense of more variety and greater potential for shopping around&mdash;finance market than we have had before, as a consequence of the deregulatory steps taken by the government. Clearly, consumers are wiser. They are turning to better deals and away from banks as the major organs of financing mortgages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move by Aussie Home Loans to reduce its variable home loan rate to 9.5 per cent when the banks, as a group, are around 10.5 per cent is some indication that this is a wider market and that consumers shopping around, not simply being bank orientated, can find areas in the market where not only is the rate lower but the conditions under which the rates are paid&mdash;the types of cocktails and conditions people can get&mdash;are different and more competitive, too. The AMP Society, along with Aussie Home Loans and a few others, coming into the mortgage area has broadened the capacity for competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that ought to be said, not in defence of the banks but in recognition of their behaviour during the last increase in official interest rates, is that the banks did not uniformly gallop off and push rates up across the board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good interjection, because there is a more competitive market between banks and between banks and the rest of the providers of finance. This has meant that banks did not uniformly push interest rates up. Some did not go the whole distance and others found different ways of offering loans. That is indicative of a growing and competitive market. It is the government's desire to make the market even more competitive and encourage consumers to shop widely and well when it comes to looking for mortgages, not just taking the face figure of the mortgage interest rate but looking at the conditions that attend to the contract as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the non-bank lenders have a small proportion of the market, as the intermediaries have too.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Can the minister explain to the Senate why the Australian dollar has fallen 25 per cent against the New Zealand dollar in the last three years, including 13 per cent in the last five months alone? Is it because New Zealand has a current account deficit of two per cent of GDP, one-third of Australia's banana republic level of six per cent, and because inflation in New Zealand is only one-third the rate in Australia? Why is the unemployment percentage in New Zealand some 30 per cent less than in Australia? Why is New Zealand able to produce a budget surplus of 3.6 per cent of GDP without any resort to asset sales and is able to double the surplus within a couple of years? Why cannot the Australian government produce surpluses large enough to fund tax cuts, increased welfare spending and a reduction in public debt, as the New Zealand government does?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to see that the New Zealand economy is doing better. That is good for Australia; it is also good for New Zealand. I pay respect to it. We may have the first glimmer of a coalition economic policy. If those opposite want to do as New Zealand did, and engage in what is fairly brutal and basically socially unfair economic restructuring that throws thousands of people out of work without support, let them stand up and say that. We will then know where its economic policy is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three things ought to be said about the New Zealand economy, none of which are meant to put it down and all of which are meant to put it into context. Firstly, in 1994, the New Zealand economy was valued all-up in Australian dollars at $68.4 billion, whereas the Australian economy grew by $110 billion. So the total value of the New Zealand economy last year was $68.4 billion, but over the last 10 years the Australian economy grew by $110 billion. In other words, we grew at almost double the rate of the New Zealand economy because of the economic restructuring we had undertaken in Australia, which did not have the same socially divisive consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Add to that the fact that several thousand New Zealanders in Australia are benefiting from our social welfare and unemployment benefit. If they returned to New Zealand you would have an unemployment rate of around 20 per cent and not the current level. A huge demand in the Australian economy for goods and services has been the major beneficiary driving economic growth in New Zealand. Therefore, New Zealand is able to benefit from the strength of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go to some of the other indicators. New Zealand's economic growth exceeded that of Australia's slightly in the years immediately following the 1982-83 recession. The New Zealand economy then moved into a period of stagnation lasting almost six years. Between the September quarter 1986 and the March quarter 1990, the Australian economy grew by 16 per cent while the New Zealand economy contracted. Is that what Senator Short wants to happen here? Will we contract our economy as it did?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On an annual basis, a comparison of the December quarter 1994 with the December quarter 1993 shows that the Australian economy grew by five per cent while the New Zealand economy grew by 6.2 per cent. Comparisons in terms of employment are striking. While total employment in Australia in the December quarter 1994 was almost 21 per cent higher than 10 years earlier, New Zealand's total employment was only about four per cent higher. Is that what the opposition wants? We got it 21 per cent higher, and New Zealand got it four per cent higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian exports of manufactures, including processed foods and basic metals, have grown strongly since the mid-1980s. This growth amounts to 12.9 per cent, current prices, from 1986 to 1993 at an average volume increase of 9.4 per cent each year. Over the same period, the value of New Zealand's manufactured exports has increased by an average of only 3.5 per cent each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on, but I can see that I am out of time. There is a sufficient case to say that, while one welcomes the changes in the New Zealand economy, in my view it is not a route that any civilised government would want to take. It is too brutal and too socially divisive. The growth that we have experienced and the unemployment benefit and welfare comfort we give is one of the reasons why the New Zealand economy is doing so well. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

In prefacing it, let me point out that full-time employment in Australia today is still less than it was five years ago at the commencement of this government's self-induced recession. Unemployment in New Zealand today is 30 per cent less than in Australia. In view of New Zealand's strikingly better economic record than Australia's over more recent years, with consequential benefits for all New Zealanders, why did the Australian Treasurer last week and the minister today and in estimates last week describe New Zealand's extraordinarily beneficial economic restructuring as crude and brutal?

I ask: what is the government doing to ensure that Australian industry will not be discriminated against in any settlement of this dispute between the US and Japan? The benefits of Australian industry through our membership of the World Trade Organisation has been questioned in the past. Will Australia's membership of the World Trade Organisation help protect our interests in the resolution of this dispute? This question has been asked, may I say, by Senator Hill&mdash;and that had a lot to do with my writing this question. It is a very important matter, as Senator McMullan will acknowledge.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our concern, the concern that Senator Cooney refers to, predates this dispute. In fact, it predates the existence of the WTO itself. Our concern has been that Japanese companies will feel pressured to buy American to placate the US government and avoid retaliatory measures and, in this current situation, that they will buy American to prevent the implementation of sanctions against Japanese luxury models&mdash;not at the expense of Japanese suppliers but at the expense of competitive third country suppliers, for example, Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I received a letter from Howe Leather, a very reputable and successful automotive component manufacturer in Australia. That letter provides a graphic example of why the government's concerns are well-founded. The concerns the Australian government has been raising about our trade interests in the US-Japan auto dispute are real, affecting real exporters and real jobs. The letter demonstrates that US government leverage on Japanese auto companies has closed opportunities for highly competitive Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Managing Director of Howe Leather, Mr Chris Heysen, wrote to me to express his deep concern that opportunities for Australian automotive components manufacturers may be further reduced by current developments in the dispute between the US and Japan. Howe Leather is an internationally competitive producer and exporter of leather for cars, specifically for luxury models. It is located in Preston in Victoria, which explains Senator Cooney's concern, and it employs approximately 450 people. It is a world-class company, adding value to Australian exports and generating jobs for Australians. It is the major leather supplier, for example, for BMW, but only a small proportion of its exports are sold in Japan. Further opportunity to compete fairly in that market is being impeded by policies of Japanese companies to buy from the US to prevent quotas or duties being imposed. Howe Leather has told me that one customer in Japan has specifically limited purchase of Australian leather to motor vehicles for export to Australia. For exports to the US and other markets, the company is being pressured to buy from US leather producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the US threat of unilateral action is already taking its toll on Australian companies as Japanese automotive producers are pressured to buy US to avoid sanctions being imposed on their luxury models in the US. This is a very important example of the reasons why the Australian government has made a request to participate in the WTO consultation sought by Japan on the proposed unilateral action. It is out of a concern to ensure that the Japanese market is liberalised in a non-discriminatory manner that we have indicated our intention to request participation in the WTO consultations foreshadowed by the US on the import restrictions to the Japanese market. It is not about taking sides in the dispute; it is about protecting Australian interests and the interests of companies like Howe Leather.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A solution to the problem presented by Howe Leather is not going to be easy because we are dealing here with the practices of private Japanese companies, not the policies of the Japanese government. On that score, the government&mdash;and most recently the Prime Minister&mdash;has obtained firm assurances from the Japanese government that Australia will not be discriminated against and we are confident at the government level that will be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to this particular company matter, I have requested that our embassy in Tokyo draw the concerns of Howe Leather to the attention of the Japanese government as a matter of urgency, and also that the letter be drawn to the attention of the US administration. My purpose is to underline to both governments that this dispute is not just a bilateral dispute between the US and Japan. The manner in which they manage this dispute and settle it will inevitably impact upon other countries supplying the Japanese market&mdash;in particular Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the principle of non-discrimination is applied in practice, companies such as Howe Leather will face the barriers they fear, not the opportunities they deserve, in the Japanese auto market. With regard to the WTO part of the honourable senator's question, the Howe example is a classic case of why we need the protection provided to us by the WTO, and why we need it to be a robust and credible organisation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your question, Senator Harradine, ranges more widely than who owns the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;whether it is the public sector or the private sector. Many of the things that you have raised in your question foreshadow the coming debate on competition policy. The purpose of the competition policy bill, when it comes through, is to bring consumer and corporate issues on competition together into one council and to provide for community service obligations&mdash;things that you have referred to about low wage earners and who looks after them&mdash;to ensure that there is a provision for community services to be met within the competition framework that we are putting down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If your question is throwing forward to the coming debate on competition policy, to begin with, the deregulation of the financial market, the opening up of new financial entities and so on, has, as I said earlier in answer to a question from Senator Kernot, created greater competition in that field. We want to see fair competition. The council that we foreshadow and its commission will ensure that. The provision for ongoing regard to community service obligations is also embedded in the legislation, as is a provision for competitive neutrality where the public sector competes with the private sector.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for her question. In fact, the other day I announced the new streamlined system to be known as the electronic lodgment facility, or ELF, for listing over-the-counter drug products. It has been developed by the TGA in consultation with consumer organisations and industry. It is interesting to note, Mr President, that Australia has not only developed this effective model but has also developed the software that goes with it, while overseas countries continue to debate whether herbal medicine should be treated and licensed as medicine at all. So Australia is very much in advance of other countries with this system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the new system begins operating in a few weeks time, herbal remedies, vitamins, minerals and sunscreen products which meet Australian regulations will be able to be approved much more quickly and for much less cost. The TGA is to be congratulated for developing this system and the software. Indeed, both the system and the software have excellent export potential, particularly in South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TGA will be conducting a series of seminars in major capital cities to explain the new system for listing non-prescription drug products. However, there is some concern that a few sponsors of traditional Chinese medicines do not perhaps have a complete knowledge of or are not sufficiently up to scratch on this matter. In discussions with the Chinese Herbs Chamber of Commerce the TGA is actually looking at ways by which it can increase information to the providers of Chinese herbal medicines. There will be a special seminar for sponsors in the Haymarket in Sydney this Wednesday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern that over the last 12 months the TGA has intercepted three large shipments of traditional Chinese medicines when importers have not placed their products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. There has been one prosecution, two shipments have been sent back, and one case is now being investigated. If we are to have this very important regulatory information, it is very important that all sponsors involved in the area get to know about this information, particularly as it will improve their capacity to get their sponsored product into the market more quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TGA seminar on Wednesday will explain the legal requirements for the import and supply of traditional Chinese medicines, and of course the offences and penalties for illegal importation. There are 25,000 over-the-counter drug products already listed with the Australian register, and these include quite a number of traditional Chinese medicines. A special committee has been established to advise the TGA on traditional medicines, including those from China. Herbal remedies, vitamin and mineral products are big business in Australia. We have always had a very good system, Mr President, but now we will have an improved system through ELF to make sure that the products are listed and that the claims about them are substantiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To help consumers when they buy these products, last week I also launched a brochure called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Buying medicines?

<PARA>I wish to comment on the reasoning that Senator Crowley  advanced for my question regarding actual new places in child care. Her answer to that was that I took it to mean that some of the new places exist in people's minds. Senator Crowley has used different terms to describe the places available in child care. She used the term `innovative' in an answer to a question by Senator Jacinta Collins on 10 May 1995 to describe the program in rural and remote areas&mdash;there would be 500 innovative child-care places. I really do not know whether this means the same as `new'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to make about Senator Crowley's answer is that over at least the last three years, and certainly since I have been concerned with this portfolio, the government continues to make announcement after announcement over the number of new places that are actually available in child care. Whether this is part of an actual figure or this is just a constant overlay by the government and an announcement of places that do not indeed exist is something that should be brought to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to again refer to the question I asked Mr Wight in estimates last week. I asked him how many were actually new places and how many were part of the government's child-care strategy or election promises. He said that they are all part of the previous commitment included in the 1993 commitment by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to provide 354,000 places by the year 2000. Mr Wight said, `So the answer to your question is in essence that none of them is new.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that case, why does Senator Crowley insist on referring to these as new places and continue to give the Senate and the voting public the impression that there is a constant program of providing new places when indeed all of these new places are simply part of the original number that was given by the Prime Minister? This is indeed giving the electorate and the Senate a totally false view of the way in which the child-care program is proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that point of view I would like to point out that it is not only confusing for the people who are going to use child-care places but also extremely confusing for the child-care centre proprietors themselves. I suggest that, instead of using terms such as `these places exist in people's minds' and that `new places' means that there is extra access to places, both of which terms were used by Senator Crowley today, she delineate once and for all for herself, for the Senate and for the Australian public which of these child-care places, if any, are new. </PARA>

If those opposite went out and talked to the community, they would discover that that is the area in which mothers and families are noting that there is not a sufficient number of places.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been announced that there will be 500 places for families in the rural areas with working needs and that there will be a flexible policy to plan for that sort of thing. It is important that people keep remembering that this is new funding for new places and that we are delivering the money to implement the policy. Policy does not get implemented without money. This is what our program has been doing, and this is what the budget has announced. As I keep repeating, family day care is an important provider of children's services and of care for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that can provide very well for this service and which will do a lot better than a lot of long day care institutions is the area of child care for children who are under three&mdash;the babies. That is what mothers and families are asking for, and that is the group that I keep getting the most requests from. It is that group and the rural people who are involved in activities and work away from towns that have need for care. They have a need for child care that is related to their work needs. The 500 places announced in the budget will enable the community organisations in these rural and remote areas to develop a program that will meet the needs of that group of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the fortune of meeting someone from rural Victoria on Saturday. She was most delighted because she felt that her rural community needs would be met very well by this project. She and the community are now feeling the challenge of how they are going to meet the demands of the project, how they are going to be able to mesh the two together. These are the important things that have been done by this government in the area of child care. If the policy-free opposition is going to stand up here and be critical of what has been happening, I suggest that it should relearn that you actually have to have a policy before you can allocate money to it and also that it should listen to the community about what they feel their needs are. </PARA>

With regard to the 2,000 new outside school hours care places, I say to Senator Troeth that they are new places under a pilot project to look at the best ways in which we can provide outside school hours care. While there is very high demand for it, there is still, in some areas, not 100 per cent usage even of the centres that are there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it is appropriate that a response be made to what has been, quite frankly, a pathetic response by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) to the matters raised so ably by Senator Troeth. The simple issue is this: at estimates, the first assistant secretary to the minister's department, Mr Barry Wight, replied that none of them&mdash;that is, the alleged new places&mdash;is new. That is the line we get out of the Senate estimates from the bureaucracy, from those officials, who do not try to put a spin on the activities of government but just try to serve it up as it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first assistant secretary let the cat out of the bag: that the government sought to commit an electoral fraud by telling the people of Australia that, suddenly, there were all these new places when in fact&mdash;and we do not have to make this up from our side&mdash;it is her own departmental first assistant secretary who says none of them is new. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have this amazing analysis by Senator Crowley of the meaning of the term `innovative'. While she was speaking and Senator West made her quite amazing contribution to this debate, I took the liberty of getting a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS>. And there the definition of innovative is very clear: it is, as suggested in the past, new&mdash;whether there were any new positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have it on record from the first assistant secretary that none of these places is new. So the point that Senator Troeth made is absolutely right. No matter what Senator Crowley and Senator West sought to do by way of obfuscation in response to Senator Troeth, neither of them answered the core question of whether any of those positions is new and, above all, whether there will be an extra child in child care as a result of these alleged initiatives. That was the point my colleague from Western Australia, Senator Campbell, was making: whether there would be any extra child in child care as a result of this alleged initiative. And you saw how Senator Crowley, when she thought she could obfuscate, responded to interjections, but that fundamental point raised by Senator Troeth was not answered and highlighted by Senator Campbell's interjection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Crowley now to say that it is new, when she is simply abiding by an ongoing commitment, really defies all logic and defies all analysis of the word new. If you have an ongoing commitment to service the people of Tasmania, like I do as a senator&mdash;I have that ongoing obligation&mdash;am I going to suddenly announce that it is a new initiative by Senator Abetz to look after the people of Tasmania? If that is the case, it means that I have not been doing the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Crowley is saying that describing ongoing commitments as something new, as something innovative on her behalf, it really means that when she makes a promise, it is of no value. Of course, we understand that as Senator Troeth interjected, because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made promises in relation to taxation and said they were l-a-w and then broke that promise as soon as the election was over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we now have a situation where the minister is trying to assert to the people of Australia that these child-care positions are new when in fact all it is is the government finally abiding, in a different sort of way, by one of its election policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments about the statements during question time and also by Senator Troeth and Senator Abetz, because to me they illustrate the fundamentally dishonest view of the opposition on this particular issue of child care. I will start at the most fundamental, that is, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the 1993 election campaign did promise that there would be 345,000 child-care places by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to restate it very carefully, because there seemed to be some lack of logic involved in some of the statements made earlier, that the instant the Prime Minister made that statement those places did not magically appear. It was a commitment made by this government and by the Prime Minister that by the time the year 2000 was reached there would be those child-care places. There have been further commitments made on an interim basis that there would be 300,000 child-care places by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to bring about these commitments, it is necessary for budget funds to be allocated. Each year a certain number of extra places are provided to reach that objective. In this year's budget certain moneys were allocated in order to produce a further 4,250 family day care places. As a result, we have gone further towards meeting that commitment. A few comments were made earlier by Senator Troeth which tried to indicate that Mr Wight said it was some sort of furphy. I would like to read out what Mr Wight said. He did not say, as Senator Troeth suggested, that it was some sort of juggling act. Concerning the places in the present budget, he answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they are all part of the previous commitment included in the Prime Minister's election 1993 commitment to provide 354,000 places by the year 2000.</PARA>

In complaining that we are making announcements in the budget to bring about our overall commitment to child care, it fails to appreciate the poor base we came from in 1983 when this government came to power. At that stage there were 46,000 places in the whole of Australia, a pitiful record that those opposite should not be proud of. I suggest that, rather than complaining about budget appropriations to bring about that child care commitment, they should think about policies to promote child care, and the family being provided with support. </PARA>

<PARA>This morning the government put on a function which Senator Kernot and I attended in the theatre in Parliament House. That function was smooth, shameless and disgusting. In the budget the government spent very little on the environment, compared with many other areas. In fact, it has shown considerable neglect for the environment. But this morning we saw its attempt to suck up to&mdash;I use the colloquialism quite deliberately&mdash;Ian Kiernan, who has done an excellent job in relation to Clean up Australia. The government, through the expenditure of a very small amount of money&mdash;$50,000 last year and this year&mdash;had the vain hope that some of his fame for the good work he has done for the environment would rub off. The government was attempting to associate itself with that work. That was shameless and smooth. One has to have some admiration, in a very crude political sense, for the operation but, frankly, I was quite disgusted by what the government was doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of my question was to contrast that with the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Only a week after the budget, he came to South Australia and announced the expenditure of $130 million on 8 1/2 kilometres of freeway through the Adelaide Hills. Not one little bit of that $130 million had been mentioned in the budget, despite the fact that we can find amounts as small as $5 million for the standardisation of the Pinnaroo line detailed in the budget. Clearly, this issue falls outside the budget. This announcement by the Prime Minister is part of a pork-barrelling exercise that will do nothing for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast what the government has done with the rail route through the Adelaide Hills&mdash;the alignment of that route was last changed in 1927; it has recently been standardised, but on exactly the same alignment&mdash;with the $130 million that has been provided for a freeway which will add to the greenhouse problem and do nothing for motor vehicle safety. Today, on World Environment Day, the government could not find it within its powers to add one dollar to any of its environment programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One question was asked by the government today&mdash;it was obviously a dorothy dixer&mdash;about World Environment Day. In his answer, the minister told us about the $17.2 million over four years that has been provided in relation to threatened species and biodiversity. That amount was included in the budget. There is nothing new about that announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Gareth Evans, in his reply, talked about an increase of 21 per cent in expenditure on the environment. Yet just last week, in asking the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) a question in relation to that claim, we found that that was only with respect to his department. He made that quite clear. He was asked about the reductions in expenditure on the environment in a number of other portfolios. Senator Kemp picked up one of them today, which is the area of energy. When that amount is taken into consideration, as is the amount of money that was not spent last year, there has been, as far as I can gather, about a one per cent increase in expenditure this year on the environment, not a 21 per cent increase, as was claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole performance of this government in general, but particularly on World Environment Day, I find quite disgusting.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Statutory Rules No 461 of 1994, being amendments to the Income Tax Regulations, which are presently before the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments confer significant discretions on the Commissioner.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 27 February 1995 concerning Statutory Rules No 461 of 1994, being amendments to the Income Tax Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed regulations confer some significant discretions on the Commissioner of Taxation. In particular, proposed regulation 51 provides that, in special circumstances, the Commissioner may determine a transitional Reasonable Benefit Limit (RBL) higher than that prescribed by the Regulations. In addition, proposed regulation 53E allows the Commissioner to extend the specified cut-off date to apply for a transitional RBL.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Parliamentary Secretary</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter received 12 April 1995 concerning aspects raised by the Committee in relation to the Income Tax Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 461. The Committee considered the letter at its meeting of 11 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has noted your advice that any decision made by the Commissioner in relation to the exercise of the discretion in proposed regulation 51 is subject to independent review under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</EMPHASIS>. The discretion contained in regulation 51 is one which may have a great significance to particular individuals. This being the case, the Committee would be grateful for your advice as to whether the exercise of the discretion in proposed regulation 51 would be subject to an independent review on the merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has further noted that the Explanatory Statement (page 14) describes the situations in which the Commissioner may exercise the discretion in proposed regulation 51 to determine a higher transitional lump sum RBL and/or transitional pension RBL. The regulations themselves do not contain any indication of the criteria against which the Commissioner should exercise the discretion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to our letter dated 11 May 1995 concerning aspects raised by the Committee in relation to the Income Tax Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 461. I refer also to a draft letter prepared for your signature and forwarded to the Committee for perusal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's concern with the abovementioned instrument is that there appears to be no opportunity for an independent review of decisions made by the Commissioner in exercise of his discretion under, amongst others, proposed regulation 51, apart from the review available under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft letter referred to appears to confirm that there is no such opportunity available for such independent review on the merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The protective notice of motion was given on 21 March 1995 and the 15 sitting day period in relation thereto is due to expire on Tuesday, 6 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee advises that a Ministerial undertaking to provide for independent review on the merits of the discretions contained in the Regulations would be a satisfactory response.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letters of 11 May 1995 and 31 May 1995 concerning the Income Tax Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules No 461 of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the Committee's concerns I undertake to introduce amendments to the Income Tax Regulations so that decisions under proposed regulations 51 and 53E will be reviewable under the Taxation Administration Act. The effect of such an amendment will be to make a decision under proposed regulation 51 or proposed regulation 53E reviewable on its merits. Regulations proposing the amendment will be tabled as soon as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is also seeking an indication of the criteria against which the Commissioner should exercise the discretion. The Commissioner will exercise the discretion if the applicant for a transitional RBL is able to demonstrate that the ordinary operation of the Regulations does not result in a transitional RBL amount that represents a fair reflection of his or her actual entitlements as at 30 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Factors the Commissioner will look at in deciding the question include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the trust deed or any other constituent document of the fund;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the case of discretionary benefits, demonstrated practice of the fund trustee or employer;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether arrangements have been entered into, but not completed, to upgrade benefit entitlements prior to 30 June 1994; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any other factors which might influence the calculation of the applicant's transitional RBL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the discretion in proposed regulation 51 is to give full effect to the objective of ensuring that people are not unduly disadvantaged by the introduction of the new flat dollar RBL arrangements. The discretion will enable the Commissioner to give due regard to the range of individual circumstances that arise in relation to superannuation arrangements which are outside the scope of the usual operation of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the discretion is necessary to cater for the complexities which arise in determining benefit entitlements in defined benefit funds. Discussions with the industry failed to formulate common rules which could be put into Regulations for all, or even a majority of, defined benefit funds. Therefore, industry consensus was that the only way to deal with all the different circumstances of defined benefit funds was by way of a discretionary power which will allow the Commissioner to determine a transitional RBL based on the consideration of all the circumstances of a particular case.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Parliamentary Secretary</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the previous correspondence in respect of the aspects raised by the Committee in relation to the Income Tax Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No.461. In particular, I refer to your letter of undertaking dated 31 May 1995, which was considered by the Committee at its meeting on 1 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, the Committee was concerned that there appeared to be no opportunity for an independent review of decisions made by the Commissioner in exercise of his discretion under the Regulations, apart from the review available under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) 1977.</EMPHASIS> The discretions are significant in that they may have substantial financial consequences for individuals. Therefore a protective notice of motion was given in respect of the Regulations on 21 March 1995, pending your further advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The undertaking above mentioned refers to the introduction of amendments to the Income Tax Regulations to enable decisions under proposed regulations 51 and 53E to be reviewed under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation Administration Act 1953.</EMPHASIS> Such amendments will ensure that decisions made under those regulations will be reviewable on the merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The undertaking refers specifically to the discretions in regulations 51 and 53E. During the course of this matter, another discretion was the subject of consideration by the Committee, namely that discretion contained in regulation 47(3)(c)(ii). Given the time constraint imposed on the resolution of this matter by the Committee's scheduled meeting and the expiration of the protective notice of motion, it was indicated that the Committee would accept the undertaking as drafted, referring specifically to regulations 51 and 53E.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate, however, your giving consideration to providing an equivalent opportunity for review of decisions made in exercise of the discretion contained in regulation 47(3)(c)(ii).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the undertaking given, the Committee resolved at its meeting on 1 June 1995 to withdraw its protective notice of motion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful for the action taken to resolve this matter and regards the provision of the undertaking as both an appropriate and timely response.</PARA>

<PARA>I shall now reflect on the content of those documents and why, in my view, it is essential that they be tabled. This return to order orders the government to provide copies of various documents which fall into three different categories: papers relating to the ATSIC board meeting No. 34; papers relating to discussions on the land fund between ATSIC and ministers and staff of ministers; and papers relating to discussions and negotiations on the land fund held between ATSIC, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and any indigenous land fund bill negotiators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These papers are necessary because they will help clarify what is meant in various statements made in ATSIC paper No. 1849. These papers will help to identify the reasoning behind ATSIC's decision to set aside $20 million for the Northern Territory out of a total of $24 million available for land purchases by ATSIC over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go over the very lengthy grounds that we raised during the debate of censure of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) and Senator Bob Collins as Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I need, for succinctness, to summarise why these papers are so vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, on a number of occasions the government has come to the Greens and this place and argued vigorously that we should not support a return to order of papers. On all these occasions the government has argued that it always agreed to returns to order, except when to do so would be to breach national security or commercial-in-confidence matters. The only exceptions, according to the government, were national security and commercial-in-confidence matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This return to order does not have either of those concerns. The government is free to say that it is arguing against the order on that basis, but that is highly unlikely and should be questioned if that is the case. If the government does not respond positively to this order, all that that will do is confirm the fears of this chamber that the government really does have something to hide and that it may be frightened that the documents will reveal a deal between the government, ATSIC and a number of key Aboriginal organisations about the concentration of money on land purchases in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has yet to give any sort of explanation about the meaning of certain statements in ATSIC brief paper No. 1849. The first is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There be special treatment for the Northern Territory for land acquisitions under ATSIC's land acquisition management program in line with discussions with government and the restrictions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Another statement is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This option contains the greatest difficulties for the parallel programs in that if ATSIC were to prioritise land management, the Northern Territory would have very little access to historical levels of land acquisition funding. The rationale for having parallel programs is therefore lost, which is the basis of the Prime Minister's agreement with indigenous land fund bill negotiators.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet another quote states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory traditional owners would lose rights resulting from the rest of indigenous people gaining access to land acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA>If the government is unwilling to provide a full and adequate answer to this matter, I for one am not willing to give it up until the matter has been fully investigated. When these papers are provided, I will then peruse them with a view to further questioning ATSIC during the supplementary estimates hearings. As was mentioned during the debate last Wednesday, there were repeated attempts to gain this information from the government via these documents and also during estimates preliminary hearings. I hope the government will now take the opportunity to provide the papers so that we will not have to take up any more time of the Senate on this matter. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was successful. Big deal! What happened? The world came to a shattering halt! The government does not wish to take up the time of the Senate, especially in light of the amount of time wasted last week. Senator Chamarette actively pursued the same subject matter in the estimates hearings on 26 May 1995 and has placed many questions on notice which ATSIC is now working its way through to provide answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wishes to express the following strong reservations about Senator Chamarette's motion. In relation to the general scope of information required in parts (b) and (c) of the motion, it is unreasonable to expect all the material covered by the motion to be identified and tabled within the time frame outlined in the motion. It must also be noted that some of the material requested in the motion would normally be exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act. The sheer breadth of the material requested would require a major diversion of staff resources to fulfil, and one which the government is not prepared to direct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also advised that there is currently an application before the Federal Court lodged by the New South Wales Land Council regarding ATSIC's decision about land purchases. The issues that may be canvassed in those proceedings would require examination of some of the documents being sought in this notice. Depending on how that action proceeds, issues of sub judice may arise. In addition, the government has on other occasions in the Senate indicated that it will not table high-level advice from departments to ministers, and the government will again not table such advice. On this occasion many of the documents contain matter in the nature of giving or receiving of opinion, advice and recommendations which is a fundamental part of the deliberative process of both ATSIC and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Senator Chamarette's request for ATSIC paper No. 1849, the document was tabled by Senator Campbell on 11 May. If the senator were able to refine her request to particular documents relating to particular discussions between identifiable parties, the government would be better able perhaps to assist in the provision of documents. I understand that Senator Chamarette was not prepared to consider that as an option. The government opposes the motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has basically gone down a path of ensuring the Senate, the parliament and therefore the people of Australia know as little as possible about the process by which it was agreed to set up a legislative structure that ensured that nearly all of the money available for land acquisition to ATSIC in the next two years goes wholly and solely into the Northern Territory and therefore creates a distortion and a corruption for generations to come of the assistance provided by the Commonwealth of Australia to Aboriginal people. The government has misled the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Chamarette seeks to do&mdash;and she has the coalition's support&mdash;is to find out how this corruption began and how this corruption took place under the nose of the Commonwealth parliament. I remind the Senate and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we thought this corruption was taking place. We had a suspicion that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was involved in this corrupt process that has actually seen a corruption of assistance&mdash;probably the first time such a corruption has occurred in the history of Australia and in the history of indigenous affairs in this nation. We warned the parliament and the government, `If you go down this path, this is what is likely to occur&mdash;that all of the money in the next two years will be put into the Northern Territory.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said to the Senate, we have nothing against Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory receiving as much assistance as they can get, because there are significant examples to show that they need that assistance. But this Commonwealth parliament has an enormous responsibility to ensure on behalf of all Australians and particularly Aboriginal Australians that there is an equitable distribution across Australia of what is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I keep on saying&mdash;and I will continue to say it until someone actually reports it&mdash;that this is not a two-year problem; it is a 10-, 15- or 20-year problem. When you buy all the extra land in the Northern Territory in the next two years, you are going to, if you are sensible, ensure that money goes into managing it so that it does not just rot and so that the people who own the land do not just sit on a piece of land they can do nothing with. It needs to be managed&mdash;be it a pastoral lease, be it some other form of economic endeavour or, as Tracker Tilmouth has said, be it even for conservation values, or cultural or traditional values and not have any economic viability. You need money to manage that land. So I say to the government that it is not just a two-year problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's deception and the corruption of this process will ensure that there is a corruption of indigenous land moneys for generations to come. I do not exaggerate; I mean generations to come. It could be 20, 30, 40 years, if not longer, because you will have this massive distortion created by the Prime Minister and offered to ATSIC. We believe, based on the ATSIC minute that was tabled in this place by me, that there was some sort of deal. Senator Bob Collins said last week, `You think this deal took place at this meeting where all these people were.' We knew about that meeting. We had that provided to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration back in the latter half of last year. We knew about that meeting. We knew who was at it. We know vaguely what was discussed at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know in this parliament that when Mr Keating sets out to do a deal, or a handshake, or a wink and a nod he does not do it in a meeting with eight, nine or 10 people. He sort of did a deal with the press gallery, I guess, at the press club when he gave his Placido Domingo speech. That did not take long to get out, and I think the Prime Minister learnt from that. But we know that when the Prime Minister seeks to do a deal he usually does it with a very small group of people with very few witnesses. It is part of history that he sought to do that sort of deal at Kirribilli House. If honourable senators look at his track record in deal making, they will see that he had himself on one part of the deal, Mr Hawke on the other part of the deal and there were two witnesses. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the Senate last week, I was in Port Lincoln only two weeks ago. Mr Acting Deputy President, I met some of your constituents there who are feeling so upset with ATSIC, so off side with ATSIC and so off side with this federal government because they get forgotten.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliamentary Secretary, that is why it is fair that we reject your arguments about the so-called major diversion of staff resources. What a shame that you would have to divert some staff from pulling out some pieces of paper about this land acquisition decision by ATSIC. You have just set up two parallel land administration systems. We told you that if you wanted to save $3 million or $5 million a year, you should set up one land fund&mdash;called the ILC&mdash;with one board and one administration. So what did you do?

Yet you have the absolute gall and temerity to say that you are not going to send to the Senate these crucial documents to uncover one of the nastiest anti-Aboriginal deals in Australian history because of a major diversion of staff resources. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sherry" NAMEID="ZW4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go through the reasons, but I will knock them down one at a time. I will knock that one down really hard, and if it gets up, I will knock it down again. A major diversion of staff resources is not going to satisfy Aboriginals, particularly in the southern parts of Australia, who will have their dispossession entrenched as a result of this corrupt deal. They do not care about your staff resources. They know that you will spend an extra $5 million per year because of this deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of this deal is $5 million a year. You could probably buy one or two stations in the Northern Territory with the cost of the administration here in Canberra because of this grubby deal. You are prepared to sacrifice the land hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal Australians to pay $3 million to $5 million a year in unnecessary bureaucratic expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians who watch television and see the odd news report and who do not have any understanding of Aboriginal affairs and land acquisition&mdash;I do not purport to have much, but I understand a little bit about it&mdash;have this sneaking suspicion in their hearts and in their guts that we seem to spend a lot of money on Aboriginal affairs but Aboriginals still seem to miss out. They also suspect that it is probably because most of the money goes into the hands of bureaucrats. This has been reinforced in their minds because you have decided to spend twice as much as you need to spend in the next two to three years on more bureaucrats and not on helping Aboriginal people either manage their land or acquire new lands for their long-term benefit and for the benefit of their children and their children's children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the time frame argument. That is the only other one. I think the FOI act is so spurious that it is a joke. That the Senate, on a majority vote, cannot order some documents to be presented because they fall outside the Freedom of Information Act is a joke. That act has nothing to do with the powers of the Senate. The powers of the Senate are determined through the constitution, through the standing orders from time to time and through precedent as set down in the Senate. The Freedom of Information Act has no relevance to what we can order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the time frame really is a very spurious argument. The debate on the censure motion took place last Wednesday, and Senator Bob Collins criticised that time frame for the tabling of the documents at that stage. Early on that day Senator Chamarette made it quite clear that she would alter the time frame to ensure that it was practical. Senator Chamarette has shown on a number of occasions, at least to me, and I think she has said it here in the chamber, that she will be flexible about the time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said, `We do not want to waste the time of the Senate, so let us stop trying to get all these documents'. If it had said, `Perhaps if you amended it for another 24 hours, we would be able to get you most of the documents and if they don't satisfy you, we could get you more', I am sure that Senator Chamarette, in her normal cooperative spirit, would have said, `We will amend our motion.' But Senator Sherry did not do that. He said, `We have got three reasons: time frame, FOI act, and a major diversion of staff resources.' There was also the business about advice between ministers and the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time frame has been amended on at least two occasions that I know of. I know that we were not able to deal with the motion on Thursday and we are dealing with it now. Senator Chamarette is giving the government another entire 24 hours. Quite frankly, if the people involved in putting together this information were not working on it on Wednesday, I would have thought they would have been working on it as a result of Senator Chamarette's questions on estimates, would they not? I understand that many of these questions have been asked there. If the time frame is a problem, you do wonder whether the government is just saying, `No, we are not going to give you this information. You can do what you want.' I am very glad to hear that Senator Chamarette has said that she will not rest until she gets this information. From my own pursuit of government documents relating to some government dealings, I know that the government can be less than helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important point that I would like to make is that it is all right for us to play a political game between the parliament and the executive in chasing these documents, but, ultimately, the executive will decide what it is going to give us. We can use all sorts of sanctions against ministers who fail to comply with these orders but ultimately the Senate, in its good judgment, will determine what sorts of sanctions should be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the outset of this process of seeking these documents; I should make that clear in this contribution. The outset was when Senator Chamarette sought information at the estimates. The debate on the censure was a further part of the debate on this issue. This return to order motion is another important part of it. I do not want this debate to conclude without people, and the government in particular, understanding the importance of what we are seeking and the importance of what this government has tried to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a prime minister take the Aboriginal affairs debate away from being, in many respects, a matter that had been ruled out of being a partisan debate. There was an incredible degree of bipartisanship in Aboriginal affairs. There were some points of significant difference between the parties, and there were some quite genuine differences about the implications of the High Court case in Mabo II&mdash;how that should be reacted to by the federal government and the various states. A lot of those were issues not based on racial differences but on the practical impact of the High Court's decision in Mabo II and how that should be implemented. That was used as a massively politically divisive issue. I guess the Prime Minister will blame us, we will blame the Prime Minister and we will not get much further on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to contrast the debate over the Native Title Act and the land fund act with what took place during the debate on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation when Mr Hawke was Prime Minister. Those discussions generally were done around the chamber. They were done by&mdash;to use Bob Hawke's famous word that will probably appear on his headstone&mdash;consensus. There were letters written between the then shadow minister, Michael Wooldridge, and John Hewson, our leader at the time, between John Hewson and Mr Hawke, and between the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, and Dr Wooldridge, and there was a genuine effort across all parties to ensure that that Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, the processes and the formation of the council, were non-partisan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what has happened since Mr Hawke left the prime ministership and Mr Keating came in. Mr Keating, who had left this impression in the electorate of being a nasty, cold-hearted Treasurer, the man who had created the recession we had to have, the man who had delivered bad economic news to Australia for 10 years, had to quickly go out and grasp a social issue to show that he was really a man who cared. Having shown very little, if any, interest in Aboriginal affairs&mdash;I cannot assert that because I do not know enough about Mr Keating's personal background in politics, nor would I ever bother to read about it, but I suspect he had little or no interest in all the time leading up to his becoming Prime Minister&mdash;he quickly went out and grabbed this issue and used it as a politically divisive issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then used what everyone knows are Mr Keating's political tactics, which are to bluster and claim that he is the one who thought of it, basically distort the whole process and use it for the crass politics of the New South Wales Right with which he grew up. That sort of politics does not work with Aboriginal affairs, I have learnt. The victims of that sort of political approach that Mr Keating has brought to the land fund debate are those people, as I have said, who have missed out as a result of Mr Keating's deal making from the New South Wales Right school of deal making. That is very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament has a duty to follow through with this, to find out the truth of it. As I said earlier, it makes little difference whether Mr Keating was the person who did the deal and who were the deal makers because ultimately it is important that we know the facts about it. It is important that the Aboriginal people who have had their dispossession entrenched as a result of this deal know what has happened. We need to ensure that, if it is possible to undo the corruption that has taken place, we find a way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, unless there is a full tabling of all the information that has been sought, if there is not an openness and a genuine willingness on behalf of the government and those in ATSIC who want to see justice done in relation to this matter, as I said, generations of young Aboriginal Australians will be the ones who suffer from this. It is an absolute disgrace that the government would seek to cover up and to hide the facts that underline the corruption of this legislative process and the corruption that has created this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to reconsider its opposition. I urge it to ensure that if this motion is passed it is complied with to the letter and that we do not have to turn this into some magnificent fight between the parliament and the executive. It should not be. All parties should decide that there has been a mistake made which needs to be corrected in the interests of all Australians. I do not just mean Aboriginal Australians; I mean all Australians, because all Australians have a big stake in this. It needs to be fixed and it can be fixed if the Senate knows the facts. I urge all senators to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I wish to respond to the words of Senator Sherry and Senator Campbell. Firstly, I want to talk about the importance of the issue. We are not, in this motion, seeking to begrudge the Northern Territory access to land funds, as Senator Campbell has already mentioned. It is the overwhelming disadvantage to the rest of Aboriginal Australia in terms of access to very limited funding for land acquisition and also management that is the chief concern; that underlies any implications that a deal was done between the government and any other people regarding the allocation of those funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for the importance of the issue is that we are expressing concern about the apparent capacity of government to influence decisions of the ATSIC board. The decision of the ATSIC board and the papers that were quoted earlier when I was mentioning the reasons for this call to order are the clearest evidence we have so far that some kind of deal and arrangement were made&mdash;not in any one meeting, but as part of the presentation of the legislation on the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason why the issue is very important is that if the government continues to refuse to cooperate, as Senator Sherry indicated that it is refusing to cooperate, then it reveals a new class of documents to which this parliament is being denied access. It is not to do with commercial-in-confidence and it is not to do with security or national interest; rather, it is to do with some kind of secrecy over the high level of decision making in government. If that is the case, then the government needs to make clear where it is stated that this is not available to the parliament and why it has suddenly made this change in policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry, basically, gave three reasons for the government's refusal to cooperate with this call to order. The first one was that it was a wasting of time and was taking us away from the normal government legislation and program of this Senate. The only people wasting time are members of the government for their failure to respond to this request. The opposition has indicated support. The Democrats are not here; however, Senator Kernot made the point in her response to the censure motion that without reading these documents she was not able to make her decision about all the issues within the censure motion. I believe that there is support for this call to order from everyone except the government. In that case, it is the governmen's failure to respond that is wasting the time. It will continue to do so as it continues to refuse to present that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point Senator Sherry made was that we did not refine the list sufficiently and that this would take up a lot of the staff's time. The reason we could not refine the list is that we do not have access to the documents. Only the government knows which of the documents that it has refer to this decision that was made in which the ATSIC board eventually decided to set aside the amount of money&mdash;$10 million a year for the next two years&mdash;to the Northern Territory for land acquisition. That decision was revealed in ATSIC paper No. 1849 and in minutes of the meeting of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission board. We can only assume that there are other documents available. It is only the government that knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are saying is: you can refine it down to anything that refers to that particular matter and anything that involves discussions between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the staff of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), the staff of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Office of Indigenous Affairs and officers of that department and any other staff of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out to me by Senator Tambling that I have omitted to mention any other ministers. When we bear in mind that Senator Bob Collins, while saying he did not know very much about this, had a discussion with Ms Lois O'Donoghue, it may be that I should have added the words `any other ministers', but I actually believe that, without amending it, we should ask the government in good faith to provide every single piece of documentation that is relevant to this issue. If it does not, then heaven help it when later on we find crucial notes which are missing that relate to the agreements and discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they emerge later on and this government is found to be in contempt of parliament by refusing to present them, heaven help the people that have been part of that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How the list is refined down is really in the hands of the government and its staff. We simply want everything that relates to that particular issue. We have no way of refining it. They do, they have the means at hand, because they can look and see which documents refer and which documents do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we ask them to demonstrate their willingness to prove that there have been no underhand deals or negotiations. It is only within the government's hands to disprove the allegations that have been made in this chamber without as full an access to documents as we would like. It has been mentioned&mdash;I requested more information in the estimates process. We do need this information and it is in the government's interest. If it has nothing to hide, then it can simply provide these documents and prove that to us. If it continues to refuse to cooperate, it is only serving as an admission of its own guilt and I believe that is not in its own interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason that Senator Sherry gave was that this goes beyond FOI requests. I think Senator Campbell answered that extremely well by saying basically, `So what? This is the parliament and it is really&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I met with a Landcare group from Western Australia. That group pointed out to me&mdash;this is an average, but it gives an interesting measure of what is happening in this area&mdash;that some two hectares of land per hour are being lost in Western Australia to salinity. Water quality in this nation is continuing to decline. Several times in recent years the Murray has ceased to flow at its mouth. Large sections of the Murray and Darling rivers have been beset by blue-green algae blooms; and the situation has been growing worst in the 1990s.

It is certainly a worthwhile program. But how many Australians know that more trees have been removed than have been planted since the program commenced six years ago? Estimates vary, but although there has been the planting of half a billion trees, there has been the loss of up to two billion trees. I recall Senator Chamarette saying at a Senate estimates hearing last week that, for every tree planted, 10 are lost. There will be some debate about the extent of the net loss, but there is no debate that there has been a substantial net loss since the billion trees program commenced. We are losing these trees by clearing land for housing and agriculture, and through disease and age. </PARA>

The coalition has distinguished itself in this area, as it has in so many others, by its absolutely do nothing approach. It has a complete policy free zone on the environment. Let us look at the coalition's record on the environment. On the odd occasion it has made a decision on which way it might jump on a key environmental issue, the result has been pretty pathetic. Let us compare the coalition's record on the environment with the government's record. It is the coalition which supported the damming of the Franklin; it is the coalition which wanted to see the Daintree logged; it is the coalition which wanted the Lemonthyme logged; and it is the coalition which has rolled poor old Senator Kemp right out the door of the cabinet, so he is languishing somewhere in the tail of the outer shadow ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the coalition which proposed in 1993 to abolish the environment department in the unlikely event it was elected to office. Its stance on issues such as forests, nuclear energy and greenhouse were described in 1993 by the Australian Conservation Foundation, absolutely accurately, as disastrous. That is the coalition's record. The environment is so important to the coalition that poor old Senator Kemp now has been caught in the job of shadow environment minister&mdash;the position is like a revolving door. He is probably the next one for the chop. In the 14 months I have been minister, I have seen three shadow ministers come and go. I do not like your chances, Senator Kemp, but I am certainly enjoying having you here while you last. It's pretty easy going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to be here as the environment minister in a government that takes seriously environmental issues and its responsibility to protect the environment in this country. This government is prepared to make the hard yards on the environment and tackle the difficult environmental problems that confront the community and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding senators in this chamber about the time and effort that has gone into the ESD process at the highest level of government with industry and the community. The development of policies in the area show an understanding and commitment by the government. They have translated into significant environmental benefits for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you have a government that is willing to put its money where its mouth is on the environment. I know it is disappointing for the coalition that the government showed that level of commitment during the last budget with an increase of 21 per cent of funding for our environment programs. But it is something that really has been well accepted in the community. It is a real demonstration of government commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suggestions that the government's approach has at times caused division are a load of poppycock. Again, this government is committed to working with governments at other levels&mdash;state and territory governments and local government&mdash;with community and conservation organisations, with industry and with trade unions to deliver the goods. We have consistently tackled significant national environmental problems in a cooperative way. We have developed strategies and delivered on them in cooperation with state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It began with the national conservation strategy in 1984. It has developed since then. Look at the record; it is an outstanding one. There was the national strategy for ozone protection in 1989. Landcare, which was released in the same year, is one of the government's most successful programs. Again, it is based on partnership and agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, we concluded the national strategies on waste minimisation and recycling, ecologically sustainable development and a greenhouse response. Since then, we have had the national water quality strategy. We are well advanced towards completing strategies on weeds, rangelands and endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I announced again that the government is proposing to proceed with the signature of the national strategy for the conservation of biological diversity. Regrettably, as we often see in the environment area, it will be without the cooperation of the Western Australian government. It is a Liberal state government that reflects the Liberal Party approach to environment issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Kemp is so committed to environmental protection in this country, he should get on the telephone to the Western Australian government, ring a few of his conservative colleagues and encourage them to be involved with other state and territory governments in delivering the goods. Senator Kemp's comment in relation to the coastal package not being developed in cooperation with the states is absolutely untrue, and he knows it. He knows that it is not the case. He knows what the truth is. But he is very disappointed that this federal government has delivered on the ecologically sustainable management of our coasts and marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp is very disappointed that, after the RAC report, the Commonwealth has been able to do that and again put its money where its mouth is, as we did with Jervis Bay, the protection of Shoalwater Bay, the protection of the Daintree and as we have continued to do. In the hard areas, such as forests, again, we are really delivering on the conservation elements and objectives of the national forest policy statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The paradox in today's motion is that, while there are certain things that the government is claiming, the only way that it can claim them as any great benefit for the environment is because the opposition has been so weak. That is the real pity of what has happened with the environment over the last 10 or 12 years. Apropos of that, those who look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record will notice that Senator Kemp, who introduced this motion today, has only raised the issue of the environment twice since he has been in that position. On each occasion, he has talked about jobs in the forests. He has not mentioned the environmental aspects of forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks today at his press release, one finds a lot of goody-goody things that individuals might do but no mention of what government might do. So we get no indication of what a Liberal government would do should it form government. It is against that background that the government perhaps looks reasonable. But that is not to say that the government's policies have been particularly good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might look briefly, for instance, at promises made in 1990. We reviewed them at the time of the 1993 election. Compare some of those broken promises with the way that the government has continued to behave since 1993. For instance, the Labor government promised to promote the case for the Commonwealth to be given increased powers to make laws with respect to the prevention of land, air and water degradation. It was also going to legislate using the trading and corporations powers to regulate the activities of companies that damage areas in Australia of national and international significance. On both those counts, the government has simply walked away from those commitments and chosen to hide behind an intergovernmental agreement with the states to really do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government failed in 1993 to protect pristine areas and other areas of high conservation value. It still continues to fail to fulfil that promise. Five years on, that promise remains unfulfilled. In 1990, the government promised to give a major increase in funding for a comprehensive biological survey of Australia to be completed by the year 2000. As we remarked at the time of the 1993 election, the Australian biological resources survey has remained at the same level in 1992-93, rising only from $1.1 million to $1.5 million. It will take centuries to complete the survey at that current level of funding. That remains the situation today. While the government has been doing certain things, it has certainly not been doing enough. It is only in the context of the opposition offering to do less that the government looks at all good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current budget, $53 million has been promised over four years. The government has promised to spend a very trivial amount each year on 37,000 kilometres of coastline. In the first year, this money is mainly going to groups to do work that is already going on, such as the stabilisation of sand dunes. I do not gainsay the value of that. But virtually nothing is going to tackle the fundamental problems that are causing coastal damage. Nothing is going into the major problems of sewage and stormwater outfalls. I note in passing that estimates now several years old suggest that it would cost something like $8 billion to simply correct the problems of the treatment of Sydney's stormwater and sewage outfall into the Pacific Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount that the government is offering is trivial in comparison with what is needed. I suggest quite deliberately that the money going to groups is really the present day version of the big whiteboard, which we saw Ros Kelly use to give money to sports groups. It is an attempt by this government to buy votes and not address the critical problems of the environment. I repeat that this government has stood back and deliberately hid behind the intergovernmental agreement so that it can claim that these problems are not its fault but the fault of state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government and the opposition have at various times both promised to use, and have used, those comprehensive constitutional powers, which I believe they should use. The government used the corporations powers under the ozone protection legislation, which was mentioned a moment ago, and, of course, Mr Fraser used the external affairs powers in connection with Fraser Island. So both parties have used the powers which are available to them to more comprehensively protect the environment. More recently, Mr Howard said he would use the corporations powers to revoke the IR legislation passed by this government. So at least in another area a Liberal government, if it should form, would be prepared to use that corporations head of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see here is that the government and the opposition lack the political will to use the powers that they have. I pick up on the wording of the motion, which states `the government's divisive approach to environmental policy'. I would strongly suggest that what we see is a lack of leadership on the part of the federal government in exercising the powers which it undoubtedly has and exercising them in a way which would allow the states to come along behind rather than simply washing its hands of environmental protection and then leaving it to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of greenhouse we have seen some woeful decisions made by the states, and this government has simply stood back and allowed those decisions to be made. One could refer to the Collie coal-fired power station in Western Australia, where both a former Labor government and now a Liberal government for purely political reasons have gone ahead with something which is environmentally damaging in terms of greenhouse. The Commonwealth government has stood back and allowed it to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could point to the Greiner government in New South Wales and the electrification of western New South Wales. It is a woeful set of decisions that this government has acquiesced in. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to oppose the matter of importance raised by Senator Kemp and to support some of the remarks made by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, who, I think, quite effectively outlined the government's commitment to both national and international strategies to combat problems with our environment. He made reference to the government's very strong record, since being elected in 1983, of protecting the environment and using all measures at its disposal to advance environmental issues and to try to build a cooperative consensus approach to those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the success the government has had in that policy can be evidenced from the speakers so far in that we have been attacked from both the left of the debate&mdash;which I think it can be fairly said Senator Coulter represents&mdash;for not going far enough and for not using our powers fully enough, and from the right of the debate by Senator Kemp, and I am not quite sure what his perspective on the environment is, even following his contribution. But clearly the Liberals and the Nationals have a much more conservative view and a far less pro-environment view than the Labor government has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that today, World Environment Day, Senator Kemp of all people sought to introduce a matter of public importance about environmental issues because World Environment Day is a 1972 United Nations initiative and, as other senators would well be aware, Senator Kemp is very positively disposed towards the United Nations and international treaty obligations as a means of tackling our problems. In fact, he tends to talk about very little else, and that is why we were surprised when the environment was placed on his agenda and he chose to speak about it today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World Environment Day is a recognition of the need for international cooperation to protect our environment and the need for everyone throughout the world to cooperate in measures designed to improve and protect the environment. So it is ironic that Senator Kemp&mdash;the person in this chamber who has on many occasions opposed our international treaty making role and opposed the use of the external affairs powers to promote national objectives&mdash;came into this house on World Environment Day to move a motion concerning the government's position and record on environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously somebody in the party room was looking for something to talk about today to prevent the racial hatred bill coming on for debate, and this was the best they could do. As I said, given the Liberal's attitude to international treaty obligations, it is ironic indeed, on World Environment Day, that they chose to pursue this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further irony in that the MPI refers to the divisive approach of the Commonwealth government. The one thing that is dividing the Australian community in terms of developing a coordinated response to environmental problems is largely narrow states rights responses to attempts to promote national action in dealing with environmental problems. It is the very narrow states rights approach adopted by, in particular, my own state's government, the Western Australian Liberal government, that has prevented major reforms and major initiatives in dealing with national and international environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is interesting that we have had Senator Kemp and the coalition talking about divisiveness on World Environment Day when, in fact, it is their opposition to international treaties and the use of those external affairs powers and their support for states rights which have largely prevented effective national strategies for dealing with a number of our major environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA government&mdash;as I mentioned, and I think Senator Faulkner alluded to&mdash;has failed to cooperate or be involved in a range of national environmental issues and forums since it was elected some two years ago. An example is the National Environment Protection Council, which is designed to pass national environmental protection measures. All other states, conservative and Labor governed, have participated in this initiative, but WA continues to refuse to participate. It argues that it is some sort of special case and that national standards do not apply in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators might be reminded that they made the same argument in respect of native title. This somehow xenophobic view that some Western Australians have about other Australians is a very worrying trend, and I suppose reflects the xenophobia that Senator Kemp displays towards anything outside this country's boundaries. But the National Environment Protection Council is a cooperative model with a states and a majority voting power, and all other states have sought to participate. The WA government, by its opposition, works against effective national combating of major environmental problems.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even former senator Fred Chaney has remarked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This seems to be a case of ideology overriding both commonsense and our involvement as Australians in national issues.</PARA>
<PARA>So I think the small `l' liberal wing of the Liberal Party is very concerned about these developments and recognises the problem that this poses to effective action in environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a similar response by the WA state government in relation to the national strategy for the conservation of Australia's biological diversity. Again, all other states have participated but, again, WA refuses to be part of that national approach which can provide a cohesive and cooperative model for tackling some of these issues. The minister is seeking to build a consensus and cooperative approach to tackling these issues, and I think we ought to give him and the government support in that approach, but we are prepared to use the powers at our disposal to protect the environment if that cooperation cannot be reasonably found. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of listening to the majority of Australians and tuning into what they are concerned about, the government seems far more concerned about listening to vocal groups who, rather than negotiate sensible outcomes, seem quite happy at times to ruin peoples' livelihoods in their quest for locking up Australia into yet more and more protected areas. Certainly we should protect our flora and fauna, but it is not the panacea to all Australia's environmental problems. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Locking up more and more forests may give the government a warm inner glow, but it is not going to change anything unless we have policies which encourage the planting of many plantation eucalypts and pines so that we can virtually eliminate the logging of our old growth forests. It has been said already that even at the completion of the billion trees program we will have lost more trees than we have planted. </PARA>

It is a big mistake on the government's behalf and it is borne out of the idea that the louder the group, the more money and attention it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that this government has yet caught onto the idea that practically all Australians care about the environment. It is not just a small vocal group; it is practically all Australians. Some few people do not care. We care about air pollution; we care about our oceans and rivers; we care about the trees; we care about salinity and land degradation; and we care about the disposal of toxic chemicals and radioactive waste. We care about the country we live in precisely because we love the Australian way of life and the country that we have to live in. We love doing those things that Australians have been doing for generations: going to the beach for holidays, camping in the outback, sailing on rivers, fishing, skiing and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia just would not be the Australia that we know if it was not for our wide open spaces and our relatively clean environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy is divisive and it has resulted in the government ignoring average Australians who care passionately about the environment but whose voices are rarely heard. Who are some of these average Australians? They are the people who, long before it became trendy to look after the environment, have been composting kitchen waste, garden waste, and all the sorts of wastes that we have. They are the people who have been planting native trees and gardens on private land. They are the people who have been recycling household water and other waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember this vividly because I spent all of my early years living where there was no reticulated water. For some 15 years my mother managed to grow vegetables and have a garden purely on recycled water from our kitchen. That was a feat in itself in a fairly dry area. We have the people who voluntarily patrol our beaches and pick up rubbish; people who grow their own fruit and vegetables; and people who install solar systems. Those are the average sorts of Australians who have cared about the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the unsung heroes of the Australian environment are the farmers and primary producers, without whom the landcare movement would be nothing. These people have played a very important part. Yet, despite all their efforts, these Australians are made to feel as though they are second class citizens; as though their efforts to clean up the environment are less worthy than those of the so-called greenies who seem to have unlimited time to travel all over the country protesting at whatever is the trendiest cause at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia, one of the trendy issues has become the World Heritage listing of Lake Eyre. Worthy of protection it may be, but it is another case of the government and the bureaucracy marching over the wishes of the people who live in the area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised the matter of Lake Eyre in this chamber many times. However, there is one instance that I would like to raise again because I think it shows exactly how divisive this government is on environmental issues. In March, representatives of the environment department were scheduled to travel to Lake Eyre to discuss the proposed listing with the local community. In preparation for the visit the local Uniting Church minister travelled 3,500 kms during the week leading up to the meeting to try and convince the people living on the stations that it would be worthwhile taking a trip to meet the bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of work went into organising and preparing for this visit: airstrips were prepared, accommodation was organised and plans were made for station owners to travel hundreds of kilometres for the meeting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, that this is a very appropriate debate for World Environment Day.

It is very pleasing that he has put forward this proposal critiquing the government's record on environment issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does, however, beg the question: would the opposition do any better?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as Senator Coulter also said, the government has been able to look good because of the opposition's appalling neglect of those issues. I believe that the Greens and the Australian Democrats would agree that we have also seen the opposition's appalling bipartisan support of the government in instances where we are watering down the federal government's responsibility and powers in relation to the way in which environmental concerns are addressed at state level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic problem is that the environmental agenda, even as held by the government's portfolio here, is essentially addressing problems that our civilisation has created and represents bandaids or, at the more dramatic level, surgery&mdash;basically damage control. We should be looking at stopping the underlying causes of these problems rather than mopping up the damage that we have created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore speak against this proposal, even though I agree with much of the sentiment behind it. I agree that the government's divisive approach to environmental policy has been a very negative force. The government's approach has failed to lead to a comprehensive program of environmental protection and an ethos which would mean that all Australians fully embrace the need to protect the fragile environment of our planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has played off environmental concerns against genuine fears in the community about job loss. In many instances, these concerns are wholly unfounded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us in this place are also guilty of whipping up division in the community. If we criticise the government for the way the environment debate has been handled, leading to unnecessary fear in the community, we must also acknowledge that this fear has been whipped up largely by industry groups and community based organisations and by some of us in this place as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not willing to support this proposal because I am not sure that this government is solely responsible for the environment's decline over the last 12 years. Its actions&mdash;its greenhouse, forest and wilderness policies&mdash;may have been a contributing factor but it is not the only one guilty of policies which have led to a decline in those areas. The pressure on the world's environment is a result of increasing levels of pollution, population and exploitation of non-renewable resources which stem largely from our civilisation's emphasis on materialism and a value system based on greed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the hole in the ozone layer over Australia, which is growing each year, is not entirely our fault. Greenhouse gas emission is an area where the government took a leadership role then turned away from making the hard decisions to support a more industry-driven agenda. The forestry debate has been highly divisive. However, the government has no monopoly on divisiveness, nor on responsibility for the decline in Australia's environment over the last 12 years. Let us all place on the record today, World Environment Day, our desire to work cooperatively towards resolving environmental problems. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder where the opposition's spokesman on the environment is? Senator Kemp proposed this matter and promptly left the chamber. He had a wonderful opportunity today, World Environment Day, to indicate the coalition's policies. It is beyond comprehension that he would propose such a matter without using the opportunity to indicate to those in the community with an interest in this matter what the coalition's policies on the environment are. It is all very well to say that the government is not doing well enough; you have to indicate how the coalition's policies would improve the situation. It is totally inappropriate to come into this place and just criticise the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the federal government's recent initiatives, outlined in its coastal policy, which highlight how much consultation and communication there is with other spheres of government and with the community at large. The government has undertaken a comprehensive policy development process to build on the findings of the Resource Assessment Commission following its coastal zone inquiry. Its blueprint for change, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living on the coast</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I note here that Senator Kemp has returned to the chamber&mdash;presents a complex task to be shared by Commonwealth, state, Northern Territory and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth coastal policy provides the means for the Commonwealth to sustainably manage its own coastal activities and includes a range of initiatives whereby all spheres of government can act cooperatively to bring about change. Where is the division that Senator Kemp and other speakers have talked about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives contained in this policy were developed following extensive discussions with state and local governments. They are designed to address specific needs through specific action at the local level&mdash;no sign of division there. The actions focus on: community participation in coastal management; integrated solutions to particular management issues; increasing the capacity and knowledge of those with coastal management responsibility to assist them to discharge those responsibilities more effectively; and developing appropriate links with our regional neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly agreed with Senator Chamarette that when talking about the environment you cannot talk about national policy only, much less about state policy. With environmental policy development we have to look across boundaries, be they local, state, federal, regional or international. That is why the coalition is so out of touch in its approach to the environment&mdash;saying that it could not do anything that would impede the state governments. You have to work across the boundaries. You have to work to persuade state and local governments to work together constructively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, has demonstrated on a number of occasions that he will work cooperatively but he will also make the hard decisions, as he did with the inappropriate proposed development on the Hinchinbrook channel. That was a very hard decision for the minister to take but he was determined to get the balance right. Yes, he will cooperate with state and local government but he has the prime responsibility in that world heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed with the opposition's contribution to this debate. On World Environment Day we should not be talking about division.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting Senator Kemp's proposal to debate the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's divisive approach to environmental policy which has meant that Australia's environment has declined in the last 12 years.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has been very keen to pat itself on the back over its environmental record. In actual fact, for the last 12 years we have seen an array of misconceptions, myths and downright political opportunism from this self-styled green government. Former Senator Richardson's book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever It Takes</EMPHASIS>, is very informative in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been keen to identify itself with the green movement. We all want to do that. Only a fool could not believe that this planet needs careful nurturing and a commitment to sustainable development. But the bind that the government has got itself into stems from its attempt to please the radical dark greens&mdash;the people who believe that plants are more important than people, that all consumerism is bad, and who are prepared to use any environmental argument, be it related to a sustainable timber industry or valuable fishing resource, to destroy the jobs and well-being of thousands of family men and women who would expect a Labor government to represent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These elements do not rely on balanced argument or commonsense. To keep them on side, this government has been full of rhetoric. But when we examine the action it has taken over the past 12 years to improve the environment, we find that its record has been disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land degradation and salinity are just two major problems that have not been tackled by this government. The extra funding in the budget for Landcare was welcomed. However, it only touches the tip of the iceberg. Andrew Cambell, the first national Landcare coordinator, issued a warning about the progress of the Landcare movement in Australia when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, existing systems of food and fibre production are unsustainable. The rural sector is ageing, declining, stressed and going broke, and depleting natural and human resources in the process.</PARA>
<PARA>Natural resource management programs are directed more at rehabilitating public lands rather than farm land. In the process, some 2,200 Landcare type community groups operating throughout Australia are providing a volunteer work force for carrying out remedial work on public lands, whilst the productive capacity of agricultural lands continues to unfortunately decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been four particular concerns about Landcare. Firstly, too little of the money provided for Landcare actually ends up on the farm. Secondly, a higher priority should be given to funding actual implementation of projects rather than demonstration projects. Thirdly, the application process for funds is excessively bureaucratic. Fourthly, there is a need to improve the range of taxation and other financial incentives to accommodate the wide range of environmental problems which occur on the farm. Information about the problem of Landcare is not enough. On this last point, I stress that the best help a government can give to proper land management on the farm is to provide an economic framework that provides economic prosperity to Australian farmers. This government has certainly failed to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For many years this government has run a high inflation economy. The cost price squeeze alone has changed the traditional face of farming in Australia. We are all losers, as farmers' terms of trade have diminished. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, the farmers' friend&mdash;as he saw himself at the recent NFF conference&mdash;has very little understanding of the way that small businesses run. He would hardly recognise that a one per cent rise in interest rates costs farmers around $170 million. When the Treasurer, Mr Willis, believes that farmers are quarantined against interest rate rises because of the availability to some of a RAS subsidy, we really start to see how tied up in the hyperbole of economic management some members of this government are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The most efficient and practical method of environmental farm management starts on the farm by farmers. It is in their interests, but it is only possible if they have a viable business and can afford proper land management practices.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1989 when Ros Kelly was the minister for the environment, she admitted that land degradation was one of the greatest environmental hazards in this country. What did she do about it? The answer is very little. Honourable senators will remember Prime Minister Hawke's statement on the environment with the grand title, `Our country, our future'. Mr Hawke spoke passionately, as usual, on the banks of the Murrumbidgee in July 1989 and announced that, by the year 2000, the government would have a billion trees around Australia planted and growing. This sounds like a grand scheme, but it is far too little if we really want a green Australia. Eight months later, Mr Hawke felt the urge to give a progress report on his statement. In it he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preservation of our soil and water resources remains an urgent task.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more, but his statement remains just as relevant today. It is a sad state of affairs that we have had a lot of words and very little action.

<PARA>I am pleased to present the report on behalf of the committee. From the title, honourable senators would think that the variation to the national capital plan No. 12 relates to Russell, and so it does. However, the inquiry goes beyond the rebuilding of the Defence buildings at Russell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee visited the buildings, and I think everybody who had not seen them before was absolutely appalled at the conditions under which serving men and women are being required to work at the present time. That includes the inside of the offices, the parking arrangements and people movements around the area. You could not go there without being absolutely certain that it is necessary to redevelop that setting. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has already examined the proposals and recommended that it proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has a different point of view from that of the public works committee. Our committee looks at it as part of the parliamentary triangle. It was a pity that it did not come to our committee before it went to the public works committee. The proposal is to demolish eight of the Russell Offices, to refurbish four of them, to build three new buildings and a multistorey car park, and to incorporate parks, walkways and other things. It will enable Defence to bring its employees into one area. At the moment, they are scattered over a number of parts in Australia. This will not interfere with the Campbell Offices, but it is proposed to bring those in other places into the Russell complex. The purpose of draft amendment No. 12 is to complete the national triangle. I want to refer to that in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The concept at the time of the design of Canberra in 1911&mdash;Walter Burley Griffin's design&mdash;was that there should be a parliamentary triangle. But it has never been quite completed. At present, the base of the triangle is Constitution Avenue, which does not meet Kings Avenue and does not quite proceed in a straight line at the relevant part of the triangle behind the Russell Offices. The committee supported the concept of completing the triangle and believes it is important to be completed at the same time that the Russell development goes ahead. If it is not carried out now, it may never be done and the triangle will not be completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The triangle can be completed through Blamey Square to the apex of the triangle, with Constitutional Avenue being straightened and Kings Avenue proceeding. What the committee was very certain about was that vehicular traffic should not proceed through Blamey Square to the apex of the triangle. I find it remarkable to think that, to have a triangle, you have to have a structure which enables cars to drive around all three sides. If that is the definition of a triangle, I think we have our concepts wrong. It is possible to extend Kings Avenue to the new apex of Constitution Avenue and to leave Blamey Square without vehicles. It is an important ceremonial place; it is a place for people. It has its memorial, and it has ceremonial functions and pedestrian functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To proceed with the extension of Kings Avenue by means of a road on each side of Blamey Square through to the junction with Constitution Avenue would destroy Blamey Square completely. I do not accept that it is necessary to have vehicles roaring around all three sides of the triangle to have it visually completed. It can be completed but with cars going off from these roads at other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was of the view that the movement of motor traffic through the square was in conflict with its memorial, ceremonial and other pedestrian functions. The committee quite clearly recommends in its report that Blamey Square not be opened to through motor traffic and that it be developed as a people's place. It would add to its ceremonial aspects and its symbolism and if we proceeded in this fashion it would enable the parks down by the river to be linked up through Russell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also concerned about the location and height of the proposed Defence buildings&mdash;the two new main buildings to be built near the apex of the triangle. The committee has recommended that the location and height of the buildings not detract from the backdrop of the hills. It seemed very clear to us that the buildings should be stepped sufficiently to allow the apex of the triangle and the hills to be observed from Kings Avenue as it proceeds into that area. It will undoubtedly result in some modification to the designs. We are talking about something that is pretty important. As I said at the beginning, we are not just talking about new offices for the Department of Defence, absolutely important though they may be. We are talking about completing Griffin's vision of the parliamentary triangle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NCPA argued that detailed design and specification of this area could not be given to us at present. We had made complaints about lack of specific information being given to us about the development of the apex of the triangle. We found it unsatisfactory that we were being asked to approve something without more detail. The fact is that what we recommend to the parliament is very likely to be accepted, and I certainly hope it will be accepted by the parliament. But if you approve of something that is not fairly completely designed, any one of us as a senator is likely to get representations later on saying, `What did you agree to that for?' We have to be very careful of what we are approving and require that more detail be given to us. It has happened with other variations to the city plan that have been given to the committee. I think we need more detail when we are doing these things. </PARA>

We have to think sufficiently far ahead not to block off the options that might enable that to happen. Another group of senators sitting in this place in years to come may well decide that that is what should happen and that it is desirable to proceed with the northern gateway. We would say, `Don't block off your options as to what can happen.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite possible to do what we are suggesting and redirect the traffic so that it does not go through Blamey Square but around the apex of the triangle and off down to other roads in the area. This can be achieved with a little bit of ingenuity, if you are committed to the concept of a people's place and a ceremonial place in the midst of the area rather than being committed to the mighty motor vehicle having free range to roar around all three sides of the triangle. I repeat what I said earlier: I reject the concept that you have to have motor vehicles traversing all three sides of the triangle for it to be a triangle. It can be visually quite complete without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot in the report and I hope honourable senators will read it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to put on record some of my reservations about the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, with which I concurred with some reluctance. Senator Reid talked about Griffin's original plan for the national triangle. As far as I am aware, that did not require the Department of Defence to be at one of the apexes of the triangle. I do not believe that Defence is such an important department compared to all the other departments in the Commonwealth Public Service that it should have pride of place at one of the three apexes of the triangle and so dominate that corner of Canberra by this plan. I put that general reservation of principle on the record. As far as I am concerned, Defence could be brought together in another part of Canberra just as easily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, the plans for all these buildings to house large numbers of staff do restrict the planning of the whole area. I emphasise that I am as much in support as anybody of the staff getting improved accommodation. Having examined some of the buildings at the existing Russell offices, I know that some of the conditions are appalling. They do deserve better accommodation. It is a pity to have the waste of pulling down buildings which were built only 20, or 30 at the most, years ago and which I would point out have been approved by previous parliamentary committees. I have reluctance about that sort of waste. I would emphasise that, having looked at the buildings, they do provide poor accommodation. There is a justification for improving the accommodation of people who have to work there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems about the whole design issue is this emphasis on Blamey Square, as Senator Reid mentioned. All the requirements of the change of plan are based on insisting that Blamey Square continue in the exact place that it is. I am not opposed to having a ceremonial square. The problem is that its existing location limits the options for the whole area. I would have preferred to have marginally relocated Blamey Square so as to provide the necessary very occasionally used ceremonial place but not to pre-empt other design necessities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Reid about not planning everything depending on motor vehicles. I do not equate planning transport corridors with necessarily having to have them for cars. It is important to plan transport corridors, whether they be for traditional trains, light rail or other forms of public transport. Those things can, of course, be provided and they do not have to be provided just for cars. The problem, as Senator Reid alluded to, is the potential future plan to have a new gateway into Canberra from the north coming virtually through the middle of the Russell area. I think anybody who has tried to traverse Northbourne Avenue in busy periods would appreciate that there probably does need, in the future anyway, to be an alternative way into Canberra other than through the middle of Civic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to keep the options open for this northern gateway. The problem is that this plan for the Department of Defence at Russell does pre-empt future plans quite substantially in that there is the location of Blamey Square; there is the planning of the two major buildings not in my mind giving sufficiently wide space between them for a future transport corridor. I think it is a pity that the long-term planning was not decided in advance of this plan for Russell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reservation is the issue of the view of the hills from Kings Avenue being interfered with by the substantially larger buildings that are proposed than are presently on the Russell site. So I emphasise these reservations that I had and mention that, while I did not go to the extent of putting in a dissenting report, it was with some reluctance that I agreed with this plan, and, while I concur with completing the national triangle, I am sad that it is the defence department that is so dominating this particular apex of it. </PARA>

<PARA>Today I am pleased to table the Senate Community Affairs Committee report on psychotherapeutic medication in Australia. This report has been dedicated to the memory of our colleague Senator Olive Zakharov, who sadly passed away last year after a motor vehicle accident. Her photograph is incorporated in the report itself. Olive was Chair of the then Standing Committee on Community Affairs when this reference was made in October 1992. She worked with great personal commitment and enthusiasm on this project, both in her position as Chair and later as a member of the new references committee. Having been a psychologist herself, she was acutely aware of the many problems which beset those people in our society with mental illness and the families and friends who care for them. Sadly, Olive did not see the report completed, but she did progress it to its final draft form and of that achievement she can be justly proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Olive would agree that the timing of the tabling of this report is particularly auspicious. Two weeks ago it was Schizophrenia Awareness Week&mdash;a time to reflect upon our own attitudes to the mentally ill and particularly the support such sufferers need to deal with their turbulent, disturbing, distressing and unpredictable lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received nearly 50 submissions from organisations and carers of mentally ill people. Many of the stories from families were particularly disturbing, but throughout each submission several common issues emerged. The first was that there is an increasing concern in Australia about the extensive use of psychotherapeutic drugs. People believe that there is too much emphasis on treatment of mental illness through medication, either because there is too little alternative treatment available, or too few medical practitioners are completely aware of the alternatives, or the cost of alternative treatments are prohibitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many groups felt that there is too little research into the side effects of psychotherapeutic drugs. A number of expert groups felt that there is too little knowledge of the range of drugs available and the efficacy of each in treating various symptoms and that there is not enough evidence of the long-term effects of various medications available. Many people felt that the general practitioner, who most often is the first point of contact for people with mental illness, is so often ill prepared to deal with it because of the unavailability of literature or the educational aspects of the medications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pharmacists drew special attention to `grocery list' prescribing&mdash;cases where polypharmacy `cocktails' are prescribed, sometimes unbeknown to GPs of patients with mental illness&mdash;cases where casual prescribing of medication has led to addiction and severe side effects and cases where patients have hoarded medication and self prescribed with disastrous effects or have not informed their GP about other drugs or medications they may be taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People gave examples of many adverse reactions to particular drugs due to improper diagnosis or inadequate prescribing and felt that so often these reactions go unreported. The issue of the use of drugs to restrain patients in institutional care was also raised by a number of submissions, with one citing Article 11 of the Human Rights Convention, that `Medication must be used only for therapeutic purposes and that it should never be administered as a punishment or for the convenience of others'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were calls for investigations into the legal rights of patients, the liabilities of manufacturers and medical practitioners, legal test cases and the operation of the Trade Practices Act in relation to the use of psychotherapeutic drugs. Nevertheless, despite the many reservations expressed about psychotherapeutic medications, many submissions supported the positive elements of medications under the right circumstances&mdash;examples of correct diagnosis and treatment obviously giving enormous benefit and enabling people to lead fulfilling lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major findings of the committee in this report were not to undertake detailed research but rather to identify some of the most obvious problems concerning the use of psychotherapeutic medication and to consider these in relation to the needs of individuals and groups within the community in general. Our major findings included first a paucity of data and information; secondly, deficiencies in service provision to particular need groups; and, thirdly, a lack of empowerment of patients and advocacy services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the submissions received from patients, carers and expert groups, the committee found primarily the data and information on mental illness to be severely lacking. This includes information about the psychotherapeutic drugs themselves, information  and  guidelines  available to medical</PARA>
<PARA>practitioners, information given to patients and carers, and information available to policy makers and government funding programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Available estimates of expenditure on mental health services are essentially just that&mdash;estimates! The data available on medication use has a number of efficiencies which affect the capacity to calculate amounts and costs of drugs used, both in the community and those provided through hospitals. The Pharmacy Guild, the Health insurance Commission and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee all collect information on medication and drug use. However, at this point there appears to be limited information available on the appropriateness of certain drugs for the individual and their condition; the long-term monitoring of the patient; the side effects of these drugs; steps taken to minimise side effects; the variety of drugs; the quantity of drugs being prescribed; and the reasons for prescription or not of some drugs&mdash;whether they are available on the PBS, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, or available at high cost or whether there is no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General practitioners lack information about alternative therapies and services, thereby overemphasising chemical and medical solutions. Anecdotal evidence says that they often under or overprescribe drugs for mental illness. GPs lack quantity independent information about psychotherapeutic drugs. There are no clear independent user friendly guidelines for the use of such drugs. Guidelines exist but they are usually produced by the drug companies themselves. The committee found that there was a lack of definition of `serious' and `less serious' psychiatric illness which hindered consideration of the types of services, therapies, medication, et cetera needed, either in residential care or in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of reporting of serious and less serious mental illness also challenges the accuracy of any figures in relation to the incidence of mental illness in Australia. Effective planning requires a more focused approach to needs identification and assessment. The fact that so many people in the Australian community are on psychotherapeutic medication suggests the existence of health and social problems. The problem of possible excessive use of medication may become more serious and more costly to the individual and the community if there is no proper assessment of medication and no provision of alternative therapies. In some cases medication may be less beneficial than other services and in others it may not be required at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task is clearly one which should be addressed by the relevant Commonwealth and state or territory bodies as part of the implementation of the national mental health policy. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence to the committee indicated that there were several areas where prescription and the use of psychotherapeutic medication needed to be monitored more strictly. The committee does not consider it has received sufficient evidence to make definitive conclusions about the appropriateness of some prescribing practices. However, it considers that the information it has received does suggest there is a need for systematic evaluation of prescribing practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that prescription patterns and the high level of prescriptions written for the concessional populations merit study by an appropriately qualified group. There may be good reasons for the prescription of a substantial part of the psychotherapeutic medication being used by the Australian population, but let us investigate the matter properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the information received by the committee, it recommends a national assessment be made of the number of people with a psychiatric disability who require home and community care services; the Department of Human Services and Health provide reports on studies undertaken on the relationship between socioeconomic status and mental health; and educational institutions and professional bodies be encouraged to emphasise training for general practitioners, nurses, psychologists and other community workers, including police and teachers, in psychiatric illness. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.the importance of the pharmacists role be recognised and that the Commonwealth examine ways in which pharmacists can become more involved in monitoring and review of psychiatric medication prescribed in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SERVICES FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee found major deficiencies in current service provision to people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, people of Non-English Speaking background, including recently arrived migrants (especially those suffering trauma because of war, torture etc), lower socio-economic groups, and some of the longer established Non-English Speaking background groups whose members may now be experiencing later life problems and other groups (including those with war service).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health system seems to have failed these groups of people&mdash;it certainly has not understood adequately their problems nor responded to the diverse health-related beliefs, attitudes and practices which are part of the culture of so many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.annual reports be provided under the National Mental Health Strategy on the provision of services for people of non-English speaking and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background and that estimates be made of the number of people requiring and obtaining such services and of the development of appropriate new services.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.specialist teams be established as a matter of priority to meet the needs of people of non-English speaking background and that funding continue to be specifically devoted to developing teams and services to meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.both community and hospital psychiatric health services take all measures necessary to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services, especially where these will help limit inappropriate service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Young People</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The needs of young people with psychiatric illness may have been overlooked to a greater extent than those of people in other age groups. The Mental Health Workforce Committee has estimated that some 165,000 persons aged 9 to 17 years are affected by a serious mental illness in Australia. Other studies suggest that some 15% of adolescents `experience some form of mental health problem' and that `more than one % have serious psychiatric disorders which warrant specialist intervention&mdash;other research puts the figures higher.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depression is on the increase among the young, which is reflected in the youth suicide rate. This, in turn, may be related to illicit drug use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As such the Committee has recommended that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">both community and residential psychiatric health services identify the specific needs of young people in their service area and develop strategies to meet these needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Homeless people</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several reports to the Committee stated that there is a clear relationship between psychiatric illness and homelessness. Although the Committee does not doubt this, it believes that the relationship is a very complex one and that there is insufficient data and information to illuminate the problems of homelessness and mental illness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Committee considers that appropriate housing is a particular need for people with psychiatric disabilities especially where this is compounded by factors which put the individual at risk. Certainly the Committee believes that where medication is the appropriate therapy, it is more likely to be effective when the patient is in a secure environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of this, the Committee has recommended that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.appropriate accommodation services be a priority for people with psychiatric illness</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.there be an assessment of the number of people with psychiatric disability using Supported Accommodation and Assistance Program Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Older people with mental illness and/or dementia, people with intellectual disabilities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some issues of concern relating to the prescription and/or use of psychotherapeutic medication for people whose major disability may be perceived by others to be disturbing behaviour. These people include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">people with intellectual disabilities</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">people with brain injury</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">aged people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Older people with mental illnesses and /or dementia are a particularly vulnerable group of psychotropic medication consumers. Anti-depressant medication is used widely to treat depression in the elderly, and alternative methods of treatment, such as psychotherapy, are seldom available. The major tranquillisers are frequently used as a chemical restraint for people with dementia whose behaviour is seen as `difficult', in settings such as public hospitals, Special Accommodation Houses and nursing homes, as well as at home. "Less restrictive environments" are frequently all but unavailable for the very confused person, who is likely to find him or herself in a locked environment (either within or outside the state psychiatric system) taking regular anti-psychotic medication and with an administrator managing financial matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The common prescription of psychotropic medication for those with developmental disability appears based more on custom than on empirical study, and driven by the belief that such drugs are effective in `quietening' patients who evidence disturbed and/or disturbing behaviours, akin to the general hospital or nursing home practice of prescribing `sleeping tablets'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The shortage of staff in residential services&mdash;including those in the community&mdash;and the lack of other assistance for families who have the responsibility of caring for people with disabilities at home&mdash;may well make medication an attractive choice. However, it is not necessarily a choice which benefits the affected individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Community Affairs Committee has recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">both community and residential psychiatric health services identify the specific needs of special groups such as older people, and the homeless in their service area and develop strategies to meet these needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Rural and remote areas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to rural and remote areas, the Committee supports the emphasis on the National Mental Health Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While limited information was received by the Committee from rural areas, a shortage of experienced medical staff was indicated with problems of inexperienced prescribing (leading to drug dependency) and much of the attention given to people with mental illness being handled by GP's.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Community Affairs References Committee has recommended that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there be a specific program to facilitate the awareness of psychiatric illness in rural, regional and remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A LACK OF EMPOWERMENT OF PATIENTS AND ADVOCACY SERVICES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Psychiatric illness is still very misunderstood in the community. Because of the stigma attached to it, such illness is probably significantly under-reported and under-diagnosed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fortunately, there is a growing number of different sufferer support groups and advocacy organisations, but there is still an enormous level of secrecy and suspicion to be overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a strong need for advocacy services. Many submissions drew attention to cases where both patients and families were ignored or not asked about their symptoms or preferences for treatment. Often initial prescribing of medication led to the patient being completely debilitated and unable to act or advocate for himself/herself. One submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person who was having financial problems was admitted for the first time to a psychiatric hospital against his wishes as an Involuntary Patient. Despite his protests he was immediately given psychotropic medication even though a detailed psychiatric assessment had not been made.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The medication used gave him severe adverse reactions and urgent medical treatment was required to overcome his life threatening reactions. Despite this occurrence he was still assessed during this 24 hour period, given a diagnosis and a treatment regime planned.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting that the consumer could not participate in the process, or respond to any questions as the severe reaction meant that he was constantly gagging on a swollen tongue.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unfortunate consumer was naturally frightened and unwilling to comply with further medical treatment. Within a short period he was returned to the community, but on a Community Treatment Order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This type of story was unfortunately very common amongst the submissions received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, many argued that patients are not given any choice or information about their treatment, neither is their treatment subsequently adequately monitored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.research be undertaken into both the rights and responsibilities of services providers and users</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.projects should address the psycho-social needs of the community which identify key issues in the consumer rights area</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.both community and hospital/institutional services develop a range of therapies and services which meet the needs of the community</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.the Government examine ways in which access to clinical and counselling psychologists can be improved</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.any development of mental health care services ensure that community-based services include a range of staff to address the needs of communities for therapies other than medication</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Community Affairs, I commend this report on Psychotherapeutic Medication in Australia to the Chamber.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985, the Wool International Act 1993 and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985 allows for a system of fees and charges to be instituted for the processed foods industry which are in accordance with that industry's wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS develops charging methodology and fee levels after consultation with relevant industry groups.  Recent consultation with the processed foods industry has confirmed that it wishes to continue with the current mix of charges applying to that program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments correct some minor anomalies and provide a more appropriate legislative basis for meeting industry's wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two amendments to the Wool International Act 1993. The first of these is to make special arrangements for the registration of low value sales. Under the present act, Wool International is required to keep a register of all wool-tax payers. The register will become the basis for the issue of equity in Wool International when it is eventually privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience has shown the upkeep of the register involves the registration of a significant number of low value sales. The industry is concerned that the cost of recording these low value transactions and issuing annual statements will be very significant relative to the worth of the tax accruing from them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of the Wool Council of Australia, other wool industry representatives and Wool International, the government has agreed to make provision in the Act for the regulations to specify an amount for individual transactions below which Wool International would not be required to automatically register the transaction. However, if a person asks Wool International to include such a payment on the register, Wool International must do so. A request may relate to payments made between the date of the regulation and the time of the request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second proposed amendment to the Wool International Act 1993 relates to information held by Wool International on carpet wool-tax payers. The purpose of the amendment is to allow the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation (AWRAP) to obtain access to the information held by Wool International on the tax payer. AWRAP will require the consent of the carpet wool-tax payer to obtain the information, in the same way that information in respect of other wool-tax payers is obtained by AWRAP from Wool International. The information may only be used to determine eligibility to attend, and voting rights at, annual general meetings of awrap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these is to remove the present requirement that AWRAP Board meetings be held within Australia. The reason for the amendment is that the operations of AWRAP have been amalgamated with those of the International Wool Secretariat to provide a more focused wool promotion and research and development effort. The Board of AWRAP has been appointed to the board of the International Wool Secretariat. There will be occasions where it is appropriate that the Board of AWRAP meets overseas in conjunction with meetings of the International Wool Secretariat. Accordingly, the Chairman of AWRAP has asked the government to remove the existing restriction on where Board meetings may be held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second proposed amendment relates to the matching of payments made by the Commonwealth to AWRAP for research and development. At present, matching payments are not to exceed certain limits within the financial year. One of these limits is the amount paid to the Organisation by way of income from the collections made under the wool tax acts for wool research and development. The effect of the amendment will be to allow the Commonwealth to match expenditure in subsequent years from tax collections where these are not all spent in the year of collection. The ceiling for the commonwealth's matching of expenditure in any one year will remain at 0.5 per cent of the gross value of shorn wool produced in australia in the financial year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e)any other matters directly related to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition parties were quick to advise me that they would not support the inquiry. I did appeal to them, through Senator Ellison, the chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, to put principle above party loyalty to the Kennett government and its questionable practices, but to no avail. It is a matter of some regret, particularly since the New South Wales referendum on the separation of powers was initiated by the then New South Wales and Liberal Premier, Mr Fahey. It was a referendum which very directly asked, `Do you approve of the bill entitled "A bill for an act to prevent parliament from changing laws about the independence of judges and magistrates without referendum"?' This referendum was carried by a very substantial majority&mdash;66 per cent. The coalition parties in the Senate had an opportunity to be on the side of principle and on the same side as this substantial majority. Instead, they preferred to rescue Mr Jeff Kennett. I believe they might live to rue the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer from the government took a little longer. According to Attorney-General Lavarch, my terms of reference for the proposed inquiry have `the appearance of a direct interference by the Commonwealth in state affairs'. The Attorney-General also went into some detail about the fact that the procedures followed by the Commonwealth DPP have been well and truly scrutinised. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On no occasion has the Commonwealth Attorney-General ever sought to exert direct or indirect political pressure upon the DPP in the exercise of his powers and functions under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. The power of direction exercisable by the Attorney-General under the DPP Act is rarely used at the Commonwealth level. The power has been exercised on two occasions only since the establishment of the Office of the DPP and not once in relation to specific proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another relevant paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Various safeguards imposed by the DPP Act guard against impropriety in the form of political interference in the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion. The Attorney-General is required to consult with the DPP prior to issuing any directions under the DPP Act. Furthermore, any directions issued under the act are required to be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> and laid before parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I am prepared to concede that these provisions indeed form some sort of safeguard at Commonwealth level. They obviously do not exist at state level, certainly not in the state of Victoria. Since the Commonwealth Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, rejects supporting my reference to the committee on the ground that there is nothing untoward in the area of the Commonwealth DPP, I believe I should point out that all this ignores the fact that I was really only using the Commonwealth DPP's office as a reference point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I do not know of any major problems concerning the Commonwealth DPP. On the contrary, prima facie, a lot of evidence is on the record that the discretion of the Commonwealth DPP is well exercised. The fact does remain that it is the Victorian DPP, the events in Victoria and the changes to the Victorian act that really are the nub of the concern. These concerns have been well publicised. There have been allegations that pressure has been exercised by Ms Wade, the Victorian Attorney-General, on behalf of Mr Kennett on Mr Bongiorno, the then DPP, to desist in his apparent intention to prosecute Mr Kennett on a matter of contempt of court regarding some remarks he made about a case that was then in progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from these allegations, we have had amendments to the DPP legislation in Victoria which limit the independence&mdash;the discretion&mdash;of the DPP. Without going into those details, it has been suggested&mdash;again, it is only an allegation&mdash;that  some of these amendments were intended to lay the ground for enabling the government to discontinue proceedings against Mr Elliott, a former President of the Liberal Party. I am saying that these are allegations, but it is important that these allegations be investigated and disposed of, if they can be disposed of, because they are serious allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not all. We continue to the next event, which is the sacking of Mr Doug Meagher QC, who was in charge of preparing the prosecution case against members of the Victorian police force relating to the shooting of Mr Jensen. Mr Meagher had worked assiduously on that brief for some two years. Mr Meagher was sacked by the new DPP without any public explanation. Lo and behold, several weeks later, the new DPP, Mr Flatman, discontinued the prosecution case against those members of the Victorian police force. These are the matters that directly relate to the concerns about the DPP's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a trend in Victoria that needs to be examined; that is, the obvious contempt with which the Victorian government, the Kennett government, treats the principle of separation of powers, which is at the base of the DPP issue. The right of appeal for ordinary citizens against government action under a particular piece of legislation is one of the safeguards of our democratic system. The Victorian parliament has always had the power to limit or prevent courts from reviewing decisions made by public servants or government offices, but with past governments the situation has usually been that the upper house has been controlled by the opposition&mdash;certainly, that was the case with the last Labor government. Therefore, there was a check on the government attempting to give itself powers regardless of what an individual citizen might wish to challenge about a government's actions under a particular piece of legislation. In the current situation, there is no such limitation. The Kennett government has an absolute majority in both houses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator O'Chee, I agree with your expression of regret. Unfortunately, there is no Senate in Victoria and no Democrats in the Senate. If there were, Mr Kennett would not be able to get away with his utter contempt for the rights of ordinary citizens. Certainly, the present situation gives much impetus to the need for reform of the electoral system of the upper house in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we could take a leaf out of New Zealand's book. New Zealand's recent reform saw proportional representation being introduced into the lower house. Let us take it step by step. For a start, we obviously need an upper house that is capable of an adequate and effective review of government action. I had occasion during the middle of last year to give notice of a motion to the Senate which listed 31 Victorian acts under which the Kennett government had proceeded to exclude any appeals to the Supreme Court. Events and statistics have progressed since then. I am informed that there are now 100 pieces of legislation in Victoria in which the Kennett government has proceeded to exclude appeals to the Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example. Residents of Albert Park have complained that the compacting process for the Formula 1 racetrack has led to structural damage and cracks in their houses. Normally, they would be able to take legal action to redress that situation and to claim compensation, but not under the Kennett government in Victoria. Their individual rights have been taken away. As a result of clauses of the Australian Grand Prix Bill, the Supreme Court is prevented from awarding compensation relating to the Grand Prix. Rather than the courts determining the issue, Premier Kennett has said that the payment of any compensation will be at his discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residents of Albert Park are not alone in having their rights taken away. There is, as I have said, a list of acts where this has been done which now extends to some 100 which have been passed by the Victorian parliament. We are looking at legislation such as the Commercial Arbitration (Amendment) Bill, the Murray-Darling Basin Bill, the Local Government (General Amendment) Bill, the Victorian Plantations Corporation Bill, the Land Titles Validation Bill, the Building Bill, the Planning and Environment (Amendment) Bill and various education acts. So the list goes on&mdash;I think it extends across the whole gamut of concerns that the community might have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has reached a proportion that has caused the judges of the Supreme Court to warn that legislation limiting their power to review government decisions has the potential to increase corruption. In their annual report, tabled in parliament, the judges said that such legislation deprives people of their normal legal rights and does not reflect equality before the law. They also warned that it vested judicial power in people not independent of the executive and limited the court's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judges identified two areas where state legislation had eroded the court's jurisdiction most severely. The first related to the vesting of power in ministers to make decisions which affect the rights of people, in conjunction with the limitation or removal of the court's jurisdiction to review such decisions. The second related to a number of instances where legislation has conferred on governments, government bodies, individuals and corporations immunity from the consequences of their actions. Conferring immunity and excluding or limiting the court's jurisdiction deprived citizens of compensation and other remedies under the law, while providing privileges for those protected under the legislation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This does not reflect equality. When . . . legislation of this kind is passed without proper justification, the parliament weakens the rule of law. Such legislation can create arbitrary power, inequality under the law and increase the risk of corruption.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the judges of the Supreme Court putting on public record that we are in the process in Victoria of dismantling the basic safeguards which citizens are entitled to under the principle of separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on at length about other examples, but I shall desist for the moment. However, I will say that, since I have been informed that neither the opposition parties nor the government is prepared to take action to safeguard the basic democratic rights of Victorian citizens&mdash;that, in fact, they are prepared to forsake them and to leave them in the lurch&mdash;I think one must make yet another attempt to tackle the issue and I propose to do it in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government says that it is not prepared to look at specific instances of the misuse of government power that can be ascribed to the Kennett government, and if the opposition parties say they will protect one of their own, Mr Kennett, to wit, no matter what he or his government does, then let me foreshadow a motion to refer to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee a much more general question. I believe that it is a question that relates to the Australian constitution. The question is whether citizens that live under state governments should not have the same guarantees, the same safeguards, that are offered to Australian citizens under the provisions of the Australian constitution which vests judicial power in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the matter which should be investigated by the committee&mdash;and I foreshadow that I will move such a reference for an inquiry&mdash;is to investigate whether it is advisable that the following should be put to the Australian community, as a referendum to change the Australian constitution: firstly, the vesting of the state judicial power exclusively in the Supreme Court of each state and such lesser courts as may be created. The vesting should be identical in its effect to the vesting of Commonwealth judicial power in the High Court and such federal courts as may be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, to ensure the independence of the legal profession, the power to admit barristers and solicitors to practise should be vested in the Supreme Court of each state, that right being subject to rules and regulations as the court may impose. This should give a right to practise not only in the particular state but anywhere else in Australia. Such right should be capable of revocation under the usual terms and provisions relating to misconduct and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, whether we should consider the creation in the constitution of the specific office of Attorney-General for each state with a prohibition on any other ministerial office being held, and with such tenure, rights and powers as the committee may find desirable but of which the duty to uphold the law by its enforcement is paramount. That is a fairly revolutionary suggestion, but very clearly the political aspects of the office of the first law officer of the state or the Commonwealth are such that it has&mdash;certainly in Victoria&mdash;damaged severely the individual safeguards and rights of citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the inquiry would look at the creation in the constitution of the specific office of Director of Public Prosecutions for each state with a prohibition on any other office being held, with such tenure, rights and powers as the committee may find desirable but of which the duty to enforce the criminal law by prosecution is paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these are matters which are exceedingly important for every Australian citizen. They have been brought to light by events in Victoria. Since neither the government nor the coalition parties is prepared to look at those events, I will challenge them to look at the substantive constitutional issues which I believe the Senate needs to consider. The best place to start is with an inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your protection, Mr Acting Deputy President. Nonetheless, I think it is relevant to the issue to expose the fact that Senator Spindler is simply on a Kennett bashing exercise. I will just complete the point I was making. Victor Perton said at the weekend, quite unequivocally, that he did not support those criticisms, that they were mainly concerned with esoteric procedural points and that there was no substantive reduction in people's rights. Certainly, in relation to the DPP, about the most we have had to date are some hints and suggestions from Bernard Bongiorno that he might like to tell all before an inquiry. There is, of course, nothing to stop him telling all&mdash;if there is any more `all' to be told&mdash;by putting it on the public record at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what the ABC has done either to try to provoke people into taking action for defamation or to try to raise the level of hysteria on the issue. The fact is that if you examine the actions of the DPP in Victoria and elsewhere, you will find that there is no evidence of compromise. Mr Bongiorno is an adult. He made his own judgments about advice he got from Jan Wade and others and he took the necessary steps. He has not for a moment suggested that somehow he had his arm twisted to take action he would not otherwise have taken. All I can say is this is about the most flimsy justification for having a Senate inquiry that I have come across in my time in this place. </PARA>

Let us not waste taxpayers' money on setting up yet another little inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler talked about the Grand Prix. He can go down there and demonstrate every Saturday, if he wants to. If he wants to be arrested, fine, go for it. If he wants to kick down a few fences, that is his legal entitlement. Let us not use that as an excuse to somehow traverse the issue of the DPP. He talked about John Elliott getting let off the hook. Elliott is entitled to write to anyone, as you are, too. If you want to put a submission to government ministers that a prosecution should not proceed, you are entitled to do that. If you want to argue your case with the DPP about a nolle, you are entitled to do that.

Senator Spindler ought to be much more concerned about the appropriate role of the DPP: whether it is appropriate for the DPP to, essentially, become a player in the media process; whether the DPP ought to be out there arguing the toss on issues; and whether the DPP ought to be stating political positions, foreshadowing action that might be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My recollection of people like John Phillips, who is now the chief justice, and John Coldrey, who is now on the bench, is that when they were DPPs you never heard a word about what they were doing. They did not give interviews, they did not flag their areas of concern, they did not say, `Come back in a couple of weeks' time and we'll have a press release for you.' That is where you, Senator Spindler, ought to concentrate your attention&mdash;go off and do a bit of homework, read the papers and find out the real problems. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review was conducted over a period of seven months during which time members of the steering committee consulted all regional offices of the DPP and interviewed all state directors of public prosecutions. The committee considered in detail the practices and procedures of prosecuting authorities in other countries such as the US, the UK and also Canada. The report of the review was released in March 1994 and the steering committee determined that the current legislative arrangements defining the role of the Attorney-General in the conduct of the prosecution process were appropriate and that there was no basis for reviewing those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no instance at Commonwealth level of the Attorney-General attempting to exert direct or indirect political pressure upon the DPP in the exercise of his powers and functions. The power of direction exercisable by the Attorney-General under the DPP Act is rarely used and has never been used in relation to a specific case. Various safeguards imposed by the legislation guard against impropriety in the form of political interference in the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion. The Attorney-General is required to consult with the DPP prior to issuing any directions under the DPP Act. Furthermore, any directions issued under the act are required to be published and laid before parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth DPP Act achieves an appropriate balance between independence and accountability and, accordingly, it is neither necessary nor desirable in the public interest to embark upon an inquiry into the independence of the DPP at Commonwealth level.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for this Senate to come to grips with the legislative program and do a bit of work.

The government has made some formal decisions today, which I have outlined to the Senate, in relation to Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995. I have made that very clear during this contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we still have a substantial program. It always requires a modicum of cooperation from parties all around the chamber, including the opposition. We seriously need to be able to deal with our legislative program. The government and the Senate are able to be derailed in the legislative program if the opposition takes a position of continual carping negativity and filibustering and finding any mechanism, ruse, way or mechanism to stop the legislative program being progressed. If the amount of time that the Senate sets aside for dealing with the legislative program becomes a reality&mdash;if we have those hours in our sitting days and weeks available to us&mdash;the government's legislative program can easily be dealt with within the time that is available. </PARA>

This is actually a chamber of the parliament, and there are different political parties and independents in this place who have as much right to have their say on what they believe is in the national interest as you have. Certainly you have a right to get your legislative program considered&mdash;and you hope that you get the numbers and have it passed. It always occurs; it is always the case; and it will always be the case during the period that we remain in opposition because we will always act responsibly. But we will not abdicate all our rights to take matters up in this place that we believe are of national importance and to take you on when we believe it is of national importance. That is what you are asking of us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given you one example where the government decided to take another half a day out of the program last week, but did it take it out of the program to address this vitally important legislative program? No, it did not. It was to enable the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give a speech on his response to the Samuels report and then to take the debate that flowed therefrom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we faced with this week? The first thing that we learnt this week was that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would like the Senate to sit longer on Wednesday night. What? To deal with this vitally important legislative program? No; in order that he can get up and give the same speech as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will be giving in the House of Representatives&mdash;to duplicate the speech that the Prime Minister will be giving in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government gets extra time from the Senate, that is how it intends to use it. That is what it regards as vitally important. Senator Gareth Evans cannot bear the thought of the Prime Minister being the total focus of attention on Wednesday night because Senator Evans sees himself as a vital part of the government's republic agenda. So he wants that debate to take place here on Wednesday night as well. Those two simple examples demonstrate that this government is not so interested in the legislation when it really comes to the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the program in such a mess? I am sorry that the minister is leaving because I am about to tell him that the program is in a mess because of the total lack of management, total lack of organisation and total disregard for the processing of the legislative program by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all started to develop towards the end of the last parliamentary session when the minister, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) washed his hands of that responsibility and sought to apply his time totally to regaining his position of credibility with green groups. When he got into so much trouble over the environmental debate&mdash;in particular, the woodchipping debate&mdash;that he no longer had time for both functions, it was the management of the Senate business program that suffered. As a result of that, the bills started to stack up, and he finds himself in a difficulty at the moment. His response is to expect the Senate to simply bow to his wish and to apply extra time to the government's program. Yet, when the government gets extra time, it does not use it for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take you back to the end of that last session again, Mr Acting Deputy President, when the bills were starting to stack up and when a government manager of business who was on top of his job would have realised that he had a problem and he needed to process the legislation. What did this government choose to do? It chose to apply a whole day to an attack on Senator Baume over a matter that arose out of the New South Wales state election. Forget the legislative program. Senator Evans could not resist it. He wanted to come in here and move a censure motion against Senator Baume. It took a whole day to dispose of that matter and, if I remember rightly, it actually went into the following day. In the end, the government accepted a compromise and did not get its censure motion at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the point. The point is that when the government had a choice between the legislative program and the chance to attack an opposition senator, the party that is in charge of this program chose to apply its time to the attack on the opposition senator rather than its legislation. It demonstrates that what Senator Faulkner has said in here today simply does not match up on merit. It does not stand scrutiny, because when the government has the opportunity to debate its program it chooses other priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the year in which the government promised us a proper organised year's program. It set it out basically in three sessions, with two longer sessions&mdash;the first and the third&mdash;to deal with the general range of legislation. The second session was one of five weeks which was predominantly to deal with the budget and budget legislation. That is why it chose to structure it this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the second half of this year, if I remember rightly, the third session, it had set aside nine weeks to deal with the program. For the second session it had set aside only five weeks because it was to be limited to putting down the budget and dealing with the budget and budget related legislation, the estimates and other matters that relate to the appropriations in the government's budget. That is what we are seeking to do. We are at the beginning of the third week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first week&mdash;obviously a shortened week anyway with the budget&mdash;was taken up with the presentation of the budget and the matters that arise in relation thereto. The second week, which was last week&mdash;the week the minister complains of&mdash;was to be predominantly estimates committees, with only two sitting days applied to government business in any event. I have already said that a portion of that estimates time was otherwise taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By now we would have expected to be on to the budget bills, of which there are many, but the government is not even choosing to put those budget bills before the Senate at this time. So one can only wonder what the government's agenda is. Even now, I came in today at the start of the third week expecting to find the budget bills at the top of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Are they? No, they are not. They are not at the top of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, apparently because there is little interest in pursuing them. But it was good enough for Senator Faulkner to come in and say, `We're not pursuing this program because of the opposition.' It has nothing to do with the opposition. The opposition does not set the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>; the government does. So what is the motive of the government in this regard? If it is not to achieve its budget legislation during this five weeks, what is it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to pay tribute to an old friend of mine, the Reverend Edgar Wells. It is appropriate that I should be doing it at this time because he was one of the people who&mdash;long before anyone else in the church or very many people in the nation&mdash;were concerned about the whole issue of Aboriginal land rights. He was a man who fought both the church and the government of the day in order to represent the people in Arnhem Land amongst whom he had been a missionary for some years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Edgar Wells was born in Lincoln, England, in 1908 and he died on 4 May 1995 aged 86 years. In the 1970s the Reverend Wells helped me understand the situation of Aboriginal people in Australia in a way that I had not understood before despite my contact during the 1960s and the 1970s with them in Mitchell and Cloncurry in Queensland. I had much to learn, even though I had had extensive contact with Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Edgar Wells was one of those people who pointed me towards questions which I had never faced before about oppression and the injustice perpetrated upon Aboriginal people. I want to pay tribute by reading into the record some of the obituary which appeared in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, as well as the record which is in the minutes of the Methodist conference in 1973 when Edgar Wells retired from the active ministry of the Methodist church. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> records this about his life:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Edgar Wells was one of the last of the old men associated with the famous 1963 `bark petition' of the Yirrkala people to the federal government for land rights. He was a white man, a missionary, whom the Aboriginal people of Arnhem Land called `Bapa (father) Wells'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was an integral figure in the struggle of the Yirrkala people, a compassionate man who came as much to learn as to convert. He was one of the very few white people to witness secret Aboriginal ceremonies, one of the first missionaries to bring Aboriginal symbols inside the church, and he did not separate children from their parents as so many missionaries did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal elder Wandjak said in 1976: `The Wellses were the only missionaries who really wanted to help the Aborigines'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mandawuy Yunupingu, the Yothu Yindi singer who was a young boy when Wells ministered at Yirrkala, last week described Wells as `a gentle person'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Bapa Wells was involved in setting a precedent in creating an awareness to the federal government and the people of Australia of Aboriginal peoples' right to their land and how mining companies should respond to traditional Aboriginal landowners,' Yunupingu said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`He stood firm with the Aboriginal people in making sure that our elders' voice was being heard and that our political and spiritual integrity was not taken away from us. We say thank you, Bapa, and thank you for your kindness.'</PARA>
<PARA>The story of Yirrkala is the story of the modern struggle of the Aboriginal people. The obituary continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prospectors had discovered bauxite in Arnhem Land in 1951, and the Northern Territory government responded by legalising mining in the Arnhem Land reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1963 the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, announced that the Gove development, a $50 million mining project would go ahead in Arnhem Land, which entailed excising most of the 51,800ha Yirrkala reserve. Wells was appalled. The quietly spoken churchman sent a dramatic telegram to the leaders of the Methodist church, nine leading newspapers and others. It said: `583 semi-nomads now squeezed by the bauxite land grab into half a square mile stop impossible to house population in approved homes within area stop . . . loss of cultivated and grazing lands means we must eat the cattle before the miners arrive and import basic food crops afterwards.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Independently, the Yolngu people began their historic protest. They wrote letters, not arguing there should be no mining, but arguing their right to be consulted about what mining should take place and under what terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1963, two federal Labor MPs, Kim Beazley snr and Gordon Bryant, visited Yirrkala and learned the Yolngu wanted to petition the Prime Minister. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Wells' church, with its Aboriginal paintings in the sanctuary, Beazley conceived the idea that the petition be a bark painting. It was presented the following month. Stating that much of the area was sacred, the petition said: `From time immemorial, we were all born here'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Wells had deliberately played no part in the drawing up of the petition, he was suspected of `agitating' and it made him enemies in the church and wider community. In June 1963 Wells told Cecil Gribble, general secretary of the Methodist Overseas Mission at Yirrkala: `The history of mining in the colonial empire leads me to believe that under no circumstances can the mining industry be trusted to secure any but their own interests.'</PARA>
<PARA>The House of Representatives committee which met heard evidence from Wells, and eventually he was transferred by the Methodist church from the mission. He refused to go, but eventually he was dismissed and sent south. Not a proud record for the church, but one which began a very steep learning curve for the Methodist and later the Uniting Church. It was not until 1993, however, that the Uniting Church, in an act of belated contrition, recognised Edgar Wells's 15 years of work with the Yolngu people of Yirrkala and Milingimbi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to read a little from the church's own tribute to him when he retired. It reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Wells had several moves around Queensland, but there was developing within him a growing concern for the Aborigines. As a result, in 1949, he offered and was accepted for service in the Northern Territory under the direction of Overseas Missions. After a year in Sydney when he was under Professor A P Elkin at the Sydney University, he was appointed to the Milingimbi Mission Station. Here he exercised a most effective and satisfying ministry in those critical and restless post-war years.</PARA>
<PARA>We also pay tribute to his wife who worked with him for many years in his missionary work. She was a nursing sister, a women's craft supervisor and weather and wireless dispatch officer. She worked with her husband in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they retired they retained a strong interest in Aboriginal affairs and, as I said, they had an influence on me in forcing me to ask many questions that I had not asked before. Their experience and wealth of knowledge of the area were frequently sought and most readily given to many people in and outside the church. I am honoured to be able to pay this tribute to Edgar Wells and to offer my condolences to his family. </PARA>
