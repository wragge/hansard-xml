As stated in the Explanatory Statements, the amendment will permit, in principle, off-shore foreign currency cheque clearance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 1 August 1995 on aspects raised by the Committee of the Casino Control (Amendment) Ordinance 1995, Territory of Christmas Island Ordinance No.2 of 1995. The Committee considered the letter at its meeting of 24 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted your advice that, while the discretions in question were not appealable, all such decisions must be tabled in each House within 15 days. The Committee prefers that these decisions be made appealable and would appreciate the reasons why this was not done. In this context the Committee noted that some other 20 decisions provided for in the Ordinance are reviewable and that some of these appear to be of less consequence than the present discretion. Also, the exercise of a discretion to cancel an authorisation could have significant adverse consequences.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 28 August 1995 concerning the Casino Control (Amendment) Ordinance 1995 (the Amendment Ordinance).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Amendment Ordinance, which amends s.87, the banking section, of the Casino Control Ordinance 1988 (the Ordinance), was made at the request of the casino operator, because of the delays and costs incurred by it with the clearance of overseas funds. Some foreign cheques were taking up to seventeen days to clear. In addition the casino operator was losing money in exchange rates because it could not obtain a fixed rate through Westpac on the deposit of foreign cheques. The casino operator advised that an example of the extent of the loss was $9,120.21 on a cheque for $652,399.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment was approved by the Casino Surveillance Authority and the Casino Controller has issued a Direction requiring the casino operator to provide him with monthly copies of all banking transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that when drafting instructions were issued to the Office of Legislative Drafting to draft the Amendment Ordinance, the matter of whether or not the Minister's decisions under s.87 should be appealable was overlooked. The Office of Legislative Drafting has since provided advice that the Minister's decisions should be appealable decisions. Accordingly, an amendment will be included in the next amendment ordinance to include s.87 decisions in s.112.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raises two matters in relation to this instrument. The first matter is in relation to possible prejudicial retrospectivity. The instrument is dated 16 May 1995 and is stated to take effect on 18 May 1995. The date of gazettal, however, was 31 May 1995.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second concern of the Committee is in relation to the absence of numbering. The Explanatory Statement states that the instrument is "Amendment No.95/03", but the instrument itself is not numbered.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 22 June 1995 requesting my advice in relation to amendments effected to the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme under the States Grants (Petroleum Products) Act 1965 (the Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Scheme in question were made by me via instrument dated 16 May 1995 (pursuant to section 4 of the Act), to take effect on 18 May 1995. The changes were gazetted on 31 May 1995, pursuant to the Gazettal requirement in section 7 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Committee raised two matters of concern with the instrument for which I offer the following in response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Numbering of the instrument</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was noted that while the Explanatory Statement for the instrument gave it an unique number (ie Amendment No.95/03), the instrument itself was not numbered. I certainly agree that an amending instrument itself should carry an unique identifier, and I am advised this is in train for future instruments under the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Retrospectivity</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Committee's concern about detrimental retrospectivity in subsidiary legislation is also well taken. In this case, there was retrospectivity for the period of a fortnight, as your Committee noted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment itself had the effect of excluding bulk delivery of eligible fuel from subsidy, which at first instance might be said to be prejudicial to a group of persons. However, detrimental retrospectivity is not prohibited in this particular Scheme (subsection 7A(2) of the Act refers, by specifically excluding the operation of subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901), essentially because eligible claimants under the Scheme are not in fact the ultimate beneficiaries of the subsidies paid under it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Scheme in short subsidises the cost of transporting eligible petroleum products (namely motor spirit, automotive distillate, aviation gasoline, and aviation turbine fuel) to remote areas of Australia and acts to benefit the consumer/purchaser in those areas by reducing the purchase price of the fuel. The subsidy is payable to claimant oil companies or distributors (paragraph 5(3)(b) of the Act refers), on condition that such claimants pass on the subsidy to the consumer/purchaser in the price that the consumer/purchaser pays for the particular fuel required (paragraph 5(4)(a) of the Act refers). Thus, the person who has the right to claim under the Scheme (ie an oil company or distributor) is really only acting as an intermediary, and does not feel the effect of changes in the subsidy, one way or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised the standard practice of the Australian Customs Service in processing Scheme amendments is to notify registered claimants of proposed changes in advance of the date of commencement, though in not all such situations does the formal Gazettal of the change occur prior to that commencement, as indeed was the case in the amendment the subject of this correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While retrospectivity is not precluded for the purposes of this Scheme, for the reasons set out earlier, I accept the general presumption against proceeding that way. I am advised that in the processing of future amendments, every endeavour will be made to Gazette the change (for which notice is given in advance to the oil companies and distributors) prior to the date of its actual commencement. I would mention however that on 21 June 1995 I approved a further amendment to the Scheme, for commencement on 1 July 1995, which was advised to registered claimants prior to that date, but which was not in accordance with the Gazettal procedures which are to be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the above comments are of assistance to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that the apparent retrospectivity of the instrument brings it within the ambit of subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Under subsection 48(2), any provision operating retrospectively which would prejudicially affect the rights or liabilities of a person other than the Commonwealth would be invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the instrument, it appears that the Determination was published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. GN16, 26 April 1995. The Determination, however, which was signed on 29 March 1995, states that the technical standard is "effective from 5 April 1995".</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 8 June 1995, drawing to my attention the apparent retrospectivity of `Determination of Technical Standard Notice TN2 Of 1995 being TS-024-1995 "Broadcasting Interface" made under Section 246 of the Telecommunications Act 1991'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that, while the discrepancy between the date of determination of TS-024-1995 and its later gazettal does render it, prima facie, retrospective, the standard does not `prejudicially affect the rights or liabilities of a person other than the Commonwealth', thereby saving it from invalidity under subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. This is because the standard has in practical terms been inoperative since its determination and will remain so for some months to come.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standard was developed to define, in advance, the level of isolation that a broadcaster would have to provide, at the interface between a telecommunications carrier's network and the broadcaster's own equipment and cabling, to obtain formal exemption from the normal technical regulation of customer equipment and cabling requirements of the Telecommunications Act 1991. AUSTEL technical regulation would otherwise apply to such equipment and cabling on an individual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision of the level of isolation specified by TS-024-1995 is to be achieved by the filling at the interface of a device, yet to be manufactured, incorporating the specifications set out in the standard. The device is currently on order by the broadcasters, with its delivery scheduled to take place 12 months beyond the date of order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The broadcasters had requested that AUSTEL formally determine TS 024 to provide them with a formal and binding specification to which the device would have to be built, before they placed their orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTEL has developed a standard which will only become operative in practical terms when a broadcaster formally seeks exemption from technical regulation for their equipment connected to a telecommunications carrier's network. Such an exemption would be based on the broadcaster having the requisite isolation device effecting the TS-024-1995 required level of isolation in place at the interface between the carrier's telecommunications network and the broadcaster's customer equipment and cabling. I am advised that this will not occur until some 12 months after 5 April 1995</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been advised by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) that in none of the above cases was it intended that the amendments were to have retrospective effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA>The Public Works Committee's 18th report for 1995&mdash;the committee has been quite busy this year&mdash;relates to the proposed relocation of the 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School from Sydney to Townsville to meet operational and training requirements. The 10 Terminal Regiment provides the army's terminal capability and most of its water transport capability. The Army Maritime School conducts individual training in maritime and terminal subjects, including maritime maintenance, and most of its effort supports the capability provided by the 10 Terminal Regiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal will place the 10 Terminal Regiment close to its primary user, 3rd Brigade, which is located in Townsville, and will also allow for the vacation of current locations on Sydney Harbour. The proposal will provide office accommodation, instructional facilities, marine facilities, repair facilities and storage facilities. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $25.914 million. It will provide quite a significant boost to the construction industry in Townsville. I know my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald showed a very strong interest in this matter. In fact, he contacted the committee during our hearings. This particular project is only part of the in excess of $100 million that is going to be spent in the Townsville region over the next year or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vacation of the Sydney sites will allow Defence to rationalise its property holdings on the Sydney Harbour foreshore. The committee notes that in relation to the land to be vacated by 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has given a commitment that any existing bushland will be retained in its natural state and incorporated in the Sydney Harbour National Park. The Chowder Bay site, occupied by the Army Maritime school, will not be developed for commercial purposes and a study is under way to determine what might happen to the land that is not bushland. This particular site is a rather unique site on Sydney Harbour with outstanding views across the heads. The committee was adamant that it be protected. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) would also be aware of this fantastic site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Activities of 10 Terminal Regiment involve terminal and watercraft operations which can be conducted anywhere within an area of operations. The 10 Terminal Regiment provides the army's terminal capability and most of its water transport capability. Terminal operations include the operation of road and rail terminals, military ports and assistance in the operation of air terminals. In essence, terminal operations primarily involve the transhipment of cargo from one mode of transport to another. This includes the receipt, storage and in-transit handling of cargo as well as the transit of troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 10 Terminal Regiment has been substantially downsized and restructured under the recent force structure review and is currently dispersed over three sites in Sydney. The unit must now concentrate to remain viable. The Army Maritime School has also been downsized as a consequence of the force structure review. Sharing of administrative support, maintenance and facilities with 10 Terminal Regiment on one site will provide additional manpower and administrative savings. Some $3 million in salaries&mdash;representing 59 positions&mdash;and administrative overheads can be saved annually if 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School can be concentrated on the one site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preferred location and level of capability for 10 Terminal Regiment have been the subject of considerable review within Defence over the last five years. These reviews have supported the retention of the capability, albeit at a reduced level, and have recommended that the unit be located at Townsville. Additionally, in the course of project development the issue of location was further investigated and the alternative locations of Brisbane, Cairns, Mackay, other Sydney sites and Darwin were analysed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Townsville is the preferred location as it would allow the unit to concentrate, maximise operational and training opportunities, allow one embarkation point for navy support and reduce training and administrative overheads. Townsville is also a key defence base with a military infrastructure which can easily cater for the additional needs of 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommending that the project proceed, the committee has acknowledged the efforts made by the Department of Defence to ensure that the proposal to locate the 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School on the Ross Island site at Townsville has minimal environmental impact. Having inspected the site, as Senator Macdonald would know, anything that goes on that site would be an improvement to what is there now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's 19th report for 1995 recommends the development of air traffic control facilities for Darwin International Airport. I am pleased to see my colleague Senator Tambling is here. I think he may be going to say something about this also. The proposal includes construction of an air traffic control tower, construction of an approach control building and provision of engineering services and site works. The estimated cost of the project is $8.4 million at May 1995 prices, with an outturn cost of $8.8 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence advised the committee that the need for a new air traffic control facility at RAAF base Darwin stems from several considerations: firstly, the existing control tower is in urgent need of repair and refurbishment; secondly, the location of the existing tower is incompatible with the future development of military facilities on the base; and, thirdly, the existing control tower is of insufficient height to provide full visibility to all aircraft movement areas and vital features. The structural damage caused to the control tower by Cyclone Tracy in 1974 was never fully repaired and the likelihood of it surviving another major cyclone is debatable, although we hope that never arises. Also, it lacks the post disaster capability required for such a vital installation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAAF has conducted a safety audit of air traffic control services at RAAF Base Darwin. That safety audit revealed that safety features require improvement, and that replacement of the air traffic surveillance radar and air communications equipment was crucial for continuing safe air traffic control operations at Darwin. The safety audit concluded that the timing for the construction of a new air traffic control facility should be advanced to ensure that no disruption occurred to air traffic services whilst allowing the efficient introduction into service of the new radar and communications equipment. At the public hearing, Defence advised that the safety audit identified a number of staffing weaknesses in the Darwin air traffic control services and that these had now been rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Siting of a new control tower midway along either the south or north side of the main runway was considered. A south side location was eliminated for the following reasons:</PARA>

All sites were in the general area north of the midpoint of the main runway and east of the FAC terminal and support buildings.

As Senator Calvert has said, the location of 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School in Townsville will provide a great boost for the economy of the Townsville region. It does to a certain extent make up for the fact that the Labor government has not fulfilled promises made by the member prior to the 1990 election, when he promised that the artillery school would be located there. It was one of the phantom promises that the Labor Party continually makes before elections. This one is not a promise of the Labor Party or the candidate; as a result of the good work done by this committee, the 10 Terminal Regiment and the Army Maritime School will be located in Townsville.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Townsville, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, already has a very large service contingent. Since the Lavarack Barracks were constructed in the Townsville region by Liberal governments in the 1960s and 1970s, it has been a major base for the services. Of course, that follows its major role in the Second World War which we recently honoured in the VP 50 celebrations in Townsville. Townsville was the garrison city of the Second World War and older people have very vivid memories of the role the services played in Townsville 50 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the establishment of these facilities will complement the already very good facility and strong presence of the army in Townsville. It will join in nicely with the air force presence in Townsville. Both of those operations&mdash;the army operation and the air force operation&mdash;are a credit to Australia's armed forces. They are located in a position in Australia which I think is appropriate. The locating of these two facilities is, for that reason, also correct. It is somewhat of a pity that the Blackhawks do not fly, or very few of them fly, so if we have to get our troops around Australia in a hurry, we are a bit curtailed. That is another matter, of course, for which this government deserves very heartfelt condemnation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. As the Senate will be aware, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 was debated at the end of June, with some 28 government amendments and 52 non-government amendments being moved. This prior bill arose from the May 1995 budget when the Labor government announced changes to the eligibility for claiming rebates under the diesel fuel rebate scheme, including retrospective amendments dating back to 1 August 1986 and the tightening of eligibility for residential, mining and agricultural claimants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate to briefly recall the Liberal-National Party coalition's original position on this legislation as a framework for the current debate. My colleagues Mr Peter McGauran, the shadow minister for energy and resources, and Senator Winston Crane in this place certainly advanced much of the debate with regard to that particular legislation. It was very complex and it certainly demanded a lot of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of most importance, we oppose the government's attempt to impose retrospective changes to eligibility back to 1 August 1986. Among other concerns, it was unacceptable that this retrospectivity would overturn several current cases before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the courts. The coalition also sought to maintain a diesel fuel rebate for those in rural and remote areas who do not have access to reticulated gas and electricity. These communities are forced to rely on expensive diesel generators and are heavily penalised for not living in a city by the petroleum excise levied on diesel. Finally, the coalition opposed any reductions in the levels of rebate paid to genuine mining and agricultural operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the complexity of the legislation and the number of amendments considered, a number of errors occurred in reflecting the will of the Senate in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995. The bill now before the Senate is to correct those errors. However, to my regret, I have to report to the Senate that not only is the original legislation flawed but the interpretation of the legislation by the Australian Customs Service is failing to match the rhetoric of the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The will of the parliament expressed in the drafting of the original act is really very clear. It is the custom in this parliament to adopt commonsense interpretations of technical language when the term is not specifically defined in an act. But a number of interpretations by Customs of the provisions agreed by parliament have failed the test of commonsense and instead adopt the most restrictive and extreme interpretations of common terminology. I certainly have evidence of that in memorandums of the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the mining industry operates many different types of access road. These include roads for transportation of ore from the mine face to processing plants, roads linking the mine site to public roads and other roads necessary for the efficient operation of a mine. Such roads are privately constructed and owned for the sole purpose of operating remote mines. However, for the purpose of claiming the diesel fuel rebate, the Australian Customs Service has chosen to interpret `access road' as meaning a road from the top of the pit to the working face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of concern relates to the definition of a mine site. Any commonsense definition of a mine site would include tailings dams, dumps, water supply, airstrips and so on. These elements are often separated by many miles through simple necessity and, in the case of an airstrip, may need to be located separately from the other mine operations for safety reasons. In this instance, some confusion has arisen over the interpretation of the words `at the place' in the definition of mining operations in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mineral exploration is a crucial activity since without the discovery of new deposits there can be no further mineral production. Exploration involves a number of activities including reconnaissance and soil sampling in remote areas, construction of access tracks and drilling. But the Australian Customs Service has indicated that the only activity eligible for the diesel fuel rebate will be the actual drilling of a hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further issue relates to the use of the word `solely', and I state at the outset that I am aware this issue was canvassed in a previous debate particularly relating to electricity. As the term applies to the definition of mining operations, it still appears to reduce the possibility of sharing services such as water and roads between remote communities and mining operations. Where, for instance, water is shared between a mine site and a community, it may well be the case that the water would not have been available but for the mine. But in sharing the water, the mining operation will be ineligible to claim the diesel fuel rebate. A further point arises as to whether this legislation would breach provisions for third party access to essential facilities under national competition reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition believes it is essential that these interpretational difficulties are cleared up in the parliament so there is the minimum possible confusion for the Customs Service and claimants in interpreting these terms. Under the self-assessment process used for claiming the diesel fuel rebate, small companies are vulnerable to any grey areas of interpretation which may become the subject of repayments and court activity involving considerable sums of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not acceptable that the intentions of the parliament have been overlooked by the Customs Service through the adoption of extraordinarily restrictive interpretations of legislation. I therefore seek some assurances from the minister, Senator Schacht, as to the meaning of these terms and interpretations to be adopted by the Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to remind the Senate of the undertakings given by the government to ensure no previously eligible mining or agricultural activity was denied the rebate as a result of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995. Quite specifically, Senator Schacht is on the record on 23 June 1995 in the economics legislation committee as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Right from the beginning I have said I have no objection to dealing with amendments to the sweeper clauses to ensure that those people who have been legitimately eligible for diesel rebate in the mining and farming industries . . . were not accidentally excluded. I said that, if people could show that there would need to be a further drafting of or amendment to the sweeper clauses to ensure that no-one accidentally got excluded, so that those who already legitimately got the diesel fuel rebate continued to get it, I would accept those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA>Such an issue has arisen relating to the construction of transport networks. The service, maintenance or repair of transport networks are already covered under paragraph (v) of the definition of mining operations but it would certainly be appropriate to include the construction of networks in this definition. The construction phase does not usually involve large quantities of diesel fuel but it is an essential aspect of mining operations and it is inconsistent for the maintenance and repair of the transport network to be eligible for the rebate but not its construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of more significance, the offshore petroleum industry has been completely overlooked in this process of clarifying the so-called sweeper clauses. As a result, a windfall estimated to be $12 million to $15 million is currently being received by the government at the expense of one of our most productive and most heavily taxed industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have received representations from the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Ltd, from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, and from the Western Australian Minister for Mines in regard to these particular issues. Those representations are very comprehensive and I know that they have also been made to the minister, Senator Schacht. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important, for the record and for consideration of these issues, that the full representations made to us by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Ltd, the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, and the Western Australian Minister for Mines be available to senators and to anyone else who wishes to consider the important impact of this legislation on these important industries. I therefore seek leave of the Senate to table the representations by APPEA to Mr Peter McGauran dated 14 September 1995, the representation of AMEC to the minister, Senator Schacht, dated 29 August 1995, and the correspondence from the Western Australian Minister for Mines, Mr Cash, to the minister, Senator Schacht, dated 18 September 1995. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that this matter be given good and proper and much fuller discussion. Therefore, it is the proposal of the opposition that, at the conclusion of the debate on the second reading of this bill, the proposed legislation be referred to the Senate Economics Committee for further consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that committee I would envisage the representatives of APPEA, AMEC, the Western Australian government, any other interested parties and the Australian Customs Service being invited to appear before an appropriate committee of the Senate to discuss fully and much more comprehensively the flaws that we now see in this particular legislation. I have prepared a series of amendments which I will certainly make available to the committee for consideration in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In consideration of the key member groups AMEC and APPEA it is important to note that the failure to notify industry and the action to subsequently legislate to remove the eligibility of industry for rebates on fuel used legitimately as part of their operations has effectively denied the industry any opportunity to contest the relevance of the case, particularly for the offshore industry. This is clearly a denial of natural justice and should be condemned by the Senate, which was not advised of the impact at any time during the debates earlier this year. There are some very important points of principle that therefore arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly aware that there are a number of other issues and concerns that have been flagged and canvassed by some of my colleagues, particularly with regard to the impact on limestone and mining in that regard. I know that Senate colleagues will address that matter, particularly if there is an opportunity before the appropriate Senate committee to be considered in further detail, and in the discussion that will be necessary with the minister. It is important that we proceed with the debate on the second reading today and then take on notice that it will be necessary for the Senate to give this matter much more comprehensive and detailed consideration in the committee on an appropriate Friday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The provisions of the bill are fairly brief and few. They address some omissions and mistakes that were made when the original bill was first before the Senate just before the mid-year break. The Australian Democrats have no difficulties with any of the provisions that are part of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the issues raised by Senator Tambling, the Australian Democrats are coming from a slightly different position. I have taken note of the Federal Court judgment in July 1993 in Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd, which dealt with the question of providing materials to the site and made it fairly clear, I thought, that the provision of these materials, the transport of these materials, was not eligible for the rebate. Admittedly, this was in the context of the agricultural industry, and it apparently took some time for the customs department to translate the effects of that decision into claims made in the mining and exploration sectors. I think there are probably some issues involved in how the customs department dealt with claims and with some of the definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, I am prepared to support the reference to a committee, provided we have an assurance. I think Senator Tambling suggested a committee on a Friday. That has a particular meaning in the Senate, as senators will know; that is, that we spend no more than a day. But I would have thought that half a day should be sufficient for this particular inquiry. Before I support the motion for that, I would like that assurance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. There is no point at this stage in going through the substantive issues that will be canvassed before the committee. Just as Senator Tambling said he would defer his amendments, I will defer comment on the substantive issues until we have heard evidence before the economics committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just state, though, the general principle that the Democrats follow; that is, that this diesel fuel rebate entitlement should not be extended unduly. We support the attempt that the government has made in the main legislation and continues in this bill to contain the drain on government revenue. I add the consideration that we need to compare the assistance being given to these industries with the assistance or the lack of assistance to other industry sectors&mdash;for instance, the manufacturing sector. We should ask ourselves whether it is appropriate, as a matter of public policy, to provide this particular assistance to the mining and agricultural sectors and to keep extending it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as a matter of principle, we are inclined to construe the provisions narrowly in an attempt to contain the drain on public revenue rather than extend assistance to these industries where other industries are not favoured in similar ways. With these remarks, I wish to confirm that the Democrats will be supporting the reference to the committee on the assumption that half a day's hearing will be sufficient.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). In this year's budget, the federal government announced changes to the eligibility for claiming the diesel fuel rebate. These included retrospective amendments and the tightening of eligibility for residential mining and agricultural claimants. However, due to the complexity of the legislation, a number of unforeseen errors have occurred. This has led to the introduction of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) to rectify these problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many problems are associated with some quarrying in my state of Western Australia. I did not speak on the original legislation, but I do feel the need to mention many of the concerns that have been raised with me by people who are involved in the quarrying business. I would certainly like to add my comments to those that have been made today and also back in June, when the original legislation was last debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation seeks to exclude those involved in the quarrying business from claiming the diesel fuel rebate, but other so-called mainstream mining activities are not excluded. I find there is absolutely no justification for that in the way that there will be different treatment of different industries. When we consider that mining is defined as the digging of a deep hole to extract a resource and quarrying is defined as the excavation of land to gather a resource, surely they could be classified, broadly speaking, as the same activity. Apparently that is not the case, and for quarriers, including the many in my state, it is a very bitter pill for them to swallow because they are certainly going to be treated in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, the government's amendments ensure that no rebate is available for activities such as the extraction of sand, sandstone, soil, clay or granite because the materials are not recovered for their inherent mineral qualities. In other words, if something could be extracted from the materials I have just mentioned a rebate could be paid but not if they are simply extracted for their raw properties, and therein lies the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that this legislation will save the government $5 million in the current financial year with retrospective savings of at least $16 million. Considering the net value of these extractive industries to the Australian economy and to local communities, I would have thought that would be a fairly small saving. The government is to be condemned, in my opinion, for drawing an artificial line of demarcation between mining and quarrying because there is no real reason why these types of extractive industries should be treated differently. In the case of open-cut mining, for example, the operation is very similar to that of quarrying, yet companies will be eligible for rebate for only the mining activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any other name this is yet another tax on businesses, including many small business quarrying operations. Quite frankly, the coalition is vehemently opposed to such a course of action when small business is the engine room of a better economy and a better standard of living for all Australians. As if some of these industries are not being hit enough by a whole range of taxes&mdash;including the fringe benefits tax, just to name one&mdash;it is a crying shame they will now be confronted with yet another tax at a time when they are desperately trying to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Large companies such as Pioneer, Boral and CSR, which constitute 75 per cent of the quarry industry, believe this measure will cost them dearly. They estimate the cost to be in the vicinity of $20 million per year and $80 million retrospectively. This is four and five times what the government plans to save retrospectively by the introduction of this ill-conceived measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that many of the materials which are quarried constitute part of the average home&mdash;bricks and mortar, just to name two of them&mdash;so in the end it will be an additional cost which new home buyers and home builders will feel. Little emphasis has been put on the end product in this measure. At a time when the housing industry is certainly not roaring ahead at a million miles an hour, I do not believe we should be imposing any extra taxes that will flow on to the end user: the average man in the street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real dilemma in front of the small quarrying operations, which are not associated with resource giants such as CSR. One of my constituents, who has a granite quarry as the family business, assures me that without the entitlement to the diesel fuel rebate it will be virtually impossible to compete with imported granite in the Australian market because of the higher cost of overheads in Australia compared with those faced by overseas quarries. What is the dilemma, you might ask? The dilemma is whether to stay open or to close. Ultimately, that decision might be made for them, unfortunately. I would have thought that, at a time when we are actually trying to encourage more local production, we would not be putting measures in place that would see importers being given an advantage over our domestic suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gentleman has also informed me that processed granite is even imported from places such as Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong, which do not quarry granite themselves but simply act as a site for downstream processing. This product is currently overtaking the Australian product because of its in-built price advantages. This new cost impost will give these countries a further advantage and will leave local people wondering whether it is worth their while at all to continue. I am very concerned that many of these companies in Western Australia, and indeed throughout Australia, will in fact find the going so tough in the months to come that they will close. What is going to happen then? We will have a greater reliance on the imported product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gentleman has also very kindly obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics a comprehensive breakdown of the granite importation figures, which include crude and roughly trimmed granite, blocks and slabs of granite, and flat surface cut granite. The data shows that Australia imports granite from all over the world&mdash;Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Finland, Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Korea, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Zimbabwe, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, the United States of America, Canada, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, Turkey, Switzerland and Japan. We are importing from all of those countries and here we are putting a further impost on local industry. When you consider the odds, I suppose we are very lucky that the government chose Australian granite to clad the walls of Parliament House when there is so much imported granite on the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the total imports of dimension stone, which includes slate, marble, granite and quartzite for facia and presentation purposes, are worth in the vicinity of $10.6 million. Granite, specifically, is worth about $3.2 million. By comparison, our exports, with a total volume of 10,008 tonnes, value about $5.8 million annually, with our two single largest market destinations being Italy and New Zealand. Most of our production is, however, directed at meeting outside domestic needs and competing against the imported product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, Western Australia leads the way in terms of total volume and value of dimension stone produced. Therefore, understandably as a Western Australian, I am very concerned that that is going to be undermined by this legislation. It just happens to be the fact that we are looking at these industries going out backwards because of a further impost they can ill afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993 calendar year, the year for which the most recent figures are available, Western Australia produced a massive 414 kilotons of dimension stone at a value of $14.1 million, according to the statistical data published by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics. South Australia is the next closest producer with a production volume of 61 kilotons at a value of $2.1 million. You can see that Western Australia is the biggest contributor to this particular activity, as is the case with the extraction of most other valuable mineral resources which our nation exports, such as iron ore, natural gas and gold to name three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were completely cynical I might reason that, because the production volume of the eastern states is far less than Western Australia's and the industries in the eastern states are going to be far less affected than Western Australia by the changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme, that is why the government has moved in this direction. If the measure were going to affect everyone throughout Australia in a uniform fashion, it would be something that would be seriously reconsidered by the Labor government. So many times it has been the case that, where Western Australia stands to be most greatly affected by the government's legislative changes, this federal government simply cares not a continental about the state which is the biggest contributor to Australia's economy and simply rams through its legislation and its amendments in the same way, as if in contempt of the Western Australian people, simply to spite the Western Australian government particularly now that it is a Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could cite the Native Title Act as one example. The bill we are debating now is another. As I said, I would not want to be too cynical about that, would I?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, the value of dimension stone production to the economy in terms of wealth generation and employment opportunities is about $19 million as a result of employment and cash flow from the quarrying operations and from the many services which support those operations. Equipment and chemical suppliers are affected as well. Once again, we have a flow-on effect from a further taxation measure that is not going to affect just one industry but has the potential, as I said before, to affect the building industry and, now, more and more of these supportive industries that go hand in glove to make sure the quarrying industry is a vital industry for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were to use the multiplier effect presented by the minister in May this year at the Minerals Council of Australia-Minex health and safety awards in Canberra, I could deduce the value of dimension stone to the economy might be closer to $30.5 million. In his opening speech at these awards, the minister described the flow-on effects of mining and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These far reaching effects are not widely understood in the Australian economy and should be.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as I am concerned, that is game, set and match. In his own words, the flow-on effect is underestimated. Yet this government is bringing in a piece of legislation that will badly affect this industry and the flow-on will be further affected. Senator Cook, with respect to quarrying: it would seem it is the Australian community which understands perfectly well that there are beneficial flow-on effects. As I say, this government simply cannot grasp that level of debate and is not concerned about the way in which a measure has a flow-on effect to a whole lot of businesses and to a whole lot of individuals and employees throughout those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of general mining activities which contribute billions of dollars to the economy, it is true that granite quarrying is not in the big league; nonetheless, it is a valuable contributor, as is any other quarrying industry. Again I stress there is no local bias for separating the activity of quarrying from mining for the purpose of amending the diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is true that quarriers will be crippled by this change&mdash;and I have no reason to doubt that it is true, from all the information that I have been given and from the conversations that I have had with people&mdash;then this government will have successfully driven yet another industry to the wall. That will have huge ramifications on costs, taxes and charges. The personal impact is something that this government seems not to worry about in terms of the jobs that will be lost, the families who will be forced into other forms of employment, if they are lucky to get employment, or forced onto welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time I am reminded of a story which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper in June accompanied by a picture of a garage door with the words `Thanks Paul!' painted over it. That told the sad story of a local carpet factory which had closed its doors after 23 years of operation because of the state of economic affairs in Australia. The owner commented that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if we are out of recession then bring it back because business was better.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are looking at at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are more businesses which will be affected, but this government seems not to care. That, of course, is so typical of this government's attitude to small business, whether they be in natural resources, such as granite, or in textiles, such as carpets or shirts. Typically, the government makes it tough for them to survive&mdash;and I do not envy those businesses one scrap, although I do admire their courage in the face of adversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people said that it was bad through the recession of the early 1980s, they had not seen anything by comparison. Anyone who believes that the recession is now over and everything is just rosy has not gone out there into the community and talked to those operators in small business right across the market. They have not gone and talked to the real estate agents, for example; they have not gone and talked to the people who were supplying materials for new homes; they have not gone and talked to the real people who simply cannot afford to get into new homes. So here we have further and further examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a record of which those opposite should not be proud. And yet the way in which they carry on now with the introduction of more and more taxes is something that is just absolutely scandalous. They promised no new taxes at the last election. Yet, since the last election what we have seen is just a litany of new taxes and the abolition of or reneging on so many of the promises that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But small business generally, as I say, has my greatest sympathy at the moment&mdash;in fact, they have had my sympathy for the last 12 to 13 years, as the Labor government has continued to tax them at a higher and harder rate than ever before. This is the legacy of this government. This is the way in which the Labor government operates, and it has to be recognised as such. When the government becomes so pedantic as to set mining aside from quarrying by playing with the words of a definition to suit their own ends and save them a measly amount, then I feel that they are really grasping as straws, and I hope that before too long they will find themselves banished into opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that those owners and employees of quarries will concur with the comments I have made. They simply want to stay in business. They do not want to see a further tax impost. They are struggling enough as it is with the taxes they have had thrust around their necks. I would certainly hope that the way in which this is treated is for it to be reassessed totally by the government. </PARA>

At Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, page 2241, on 29 June 1995, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will have open discussion and bend over backwards to accept those definitions to ensure that all of those who had been getting the rebate scheme would continue to get it.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. I was there. I heard him say it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the amendments are not consistent with what was agreed to at the time. I sat on the committee that looked at this and I know that, on the pastoral side of things, all the recommendations that came out of that committee have not gone through into these amendments&mdash;and that is why, Senator Sherry, we are here, going through this a second time. We will go through it time and time again ad nauseam, if we have to, until we get to the points that were agreed to at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, diesel fuel oil used in the movement of seismic vessels to and from port to undertake exploration used to be available for rebate. Under the legislation, as put before us, that rebate will be available only when those ships are in an exploration area. That is one very small example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the pastoral and agricultural area, the rebate on the making of roads within a pastoral area is not defined. It is a definition mostly to keep it on to roads or tracks&mdash;working away from those pastoral tracks. It seems to me that is not covered. So, for those reasons, we believe that it should go back to a committee and be looked at again. That is the only way we will sort it out properly. All the advisers you have there were at that committee hearing and they sat through all that debate. I am sorry you will have to go through the committee process again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to confine my remarks in relation to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) to the limestone aspect of the legislation the government previously brought before the chamber and which they are trying to fix with this legislation. I am sorry the minister is not here because I really would like a comment from him in his summing up of this debate to try to clarify some aspects of this bill. That clarification may avert the need for calling a lot of witnesses to the Friday morning committee&mdash;and I stress, morning. So perhaps the parliamentary secretary or the advisers could advise me, in summing up the debate, on some of the answers to the questions that I might put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in passing that the minister in charge of the bill is the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht). The legislation he is dealing with here is most debilitating to small business and to the construction industry. So one would think that he really should be called the minister for destroying small business and destroying the construction industry. I hope the minister in those capacities at least might understand what impact this customs legislation is having on small business and on the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also has an environmental aspect, which I am sure the Democrats and the Greens would be very interested in. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that toxic footprints are stealing across the Australian landscape, bringing destruction on a scale to dwarf other environmental threats. Ninety million hectares of fertile farmland face a slow chemical death as acid in the soil eats away at present production and future export potential. In a study released recently, the federal Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation pinpointed acid soils as the gravest resource and conservation issue facing the country and claimed that it was one of the most neglected. Acid soils already cost Australia $300 million a year in lost production&mdash;50 per cent more than salinity. We talk about salinity quite a lot. We do not talk about acid soils, yet it is destroying our farmlands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless this problem is corrected now, losses will mount sharply. Part of the problem with acidity is that it is a chemical reaction in the soil and, unlike salinity, it does not strike people visually. Soil acidity is a natural consequence of any kind of farming. To maintain their internal PH, plants excrete acid substances into the soil. The constant removal of crops and pastures containing alkaline material means that most soils tend to go slowly acid. The process could be reversed by applying lime. I hope the parliamentary secretary is listening to my comments. By applying lime, you can address that enormous environmental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Estimates suggest that about 35 million hectares of soil are highly acidic and that another 55 million hectares are moderately to slightly acidic. But just treating 1.5 million hectares where acid levels are dangerously high would require 2.3 million tonnes of lime at a cost of about $120 million. To protect and maintain the remainder would cost a further $130 million a year. Many farmers believe that they cannot afford such a huge up-front cost. The result is that 500,000 tonnes of lime are being applied annually, which is less than one-tenth of what is actually needed. The President of the Soil and Water Conservation Association, Mr Rick Farley, said that acid soil is the forgotten issue. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly a lot of farmers would like to do more about acid soils, but tragically that is out of the question in the present tight financial circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>We have an acid soil problem, but we have a solution&mdash;limestone. But farmers cannot do anything about the problem because they currently cannot afford the cost of limestone. Through this legislation, the government will further increase the cost of limestone. Limestone producers tell me that this legislation will increase the cost of limestone by about 10 per cent. In round figures&mdash;it varies across Australia&mdash;the cost of limestone is about $20 a tonne. This will take the cost up to between $22 and $23 a tonne. It simply makes the situation more and more difficult. I would hope that the Democrats and Greens might be able to consider that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this issue in a question on notice. I thank the department for providing me with the answer, which I received pretty late yesterday. I asked them whether the definition of `mineral' included the calcium carbonate, which is the principal part of limestone. I am not a technical person. I think I failed senior chemistry, and that will become pretty obvious in what I say in this technical area. But I hope I can get the message across. Limestone is principally calcium carbonate, which is a mineral. I asked the department whether companies which mine and crush limestone for the production of agricultural lime are eligible to claim the diesel fuel rebate, and I got this answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the amended definition of "minerals", diesel fuel purchased for use to extract limestone per se is not rebatable as limestone is not recognised as a mineral in its own right. But diesel fuel purchased for use to extract or crush limestone as an ore with a view to recovering from it a particular mineral or particular minerals will continue to be rebatable.</PARA>
<PARA>The industry people tell me that limestone is extracted for use of its mineral qualities&mdash;its calcium carbonate oxide. Does that mean that limestone extracted for the use of the calcium carbonate component&mdash;that is, its chemical and mineral qualities&mdash;is rebatable? I understand from the industry that, after you extract limestone, you crush it into varying sizes. Its exposure to soil does have an effect on the size of the final product. But, when the calcium carbonate component of the limestone spreads on acid soils, it leaches the soils, as I understand it. It is an alkaline substance and it takes away&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it neutralises it. Senator Panizza obviously understands the technicalities much better than I do. Hopefully, I am getting across the problem to the parliamentary secretary and his advisers. Hopefully, in responding to this debate, the parliamentary secretary can say to me, `Yes, I agree with you and I agree that this answer that you received in writing to the question I put on notice does mean that if limestone is extracted and crushed for its use as calcium carbonate to neutralise acid soils, it is a mineral within the course of the definition and therefore is rebatable.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The customs office is obviously having quite a deal of difficulty with this. I have been contacted by an enormous number of limestone producers&mdash;quarriers&mdash;and more recently by farmers' groups. It has taken some time for the message to get through to the farmers. They will not really understand the impact of this until the limestone producers take out the next load of lime to address acid soils and they have to pay 10 per cent more of it. At that stage the farming community will suddenly become very irate at this because it is an environmental thing. It is something that assists our export of primary production, yet they will be slugged this additional price for it. I know that the National Farmers Federation is now becoming interested in it as the full impact of the government's legislation is becoming known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that limestone is mined and used in different ways. Figures I have for 1989-90 tell me that nine million tonnes of limestone are used for the annual production of cement, 2.3 million tonnes are used in industrial lime and quick lime, 1.2 per cent is used in flux, 0.6 of one million tonnes is used for soil acidification treatment and water acidification treatment, seven million tonnes are used for construction and aggregate and 0.5 million tonnes are used for others&mdash;a total of about 20.6 million tonnes. Only one of those categories is not used for its mineral and chemical qualities&mdash;that is, for on the construction and aggregate industry. I understand from the industry that it is used in construction and aggregate simply as a replacement for blue metal. It is just used as a substance rather than for its chemical and mineral qualities. In every other instance&mdash;that is, in its cement production, in its industrial lime and quick lime use as a flux and certainly in soil acidification treatment, it is used for its mineral and chemical qualities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question that I would ask the parliamentary secretary to address in his response is: would he agree that the use of limestone for those other, except for construction in aggregate, does enable it to be classed as a mineral and therefore eligible for the diesel fuel rebate? As I said, the customs office is quite understandably confused about this. It is not a criticism; I simply do not blame them. It told one of the producers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you extract limestone, but because of its calcium carbonate content it is not regarded as limestone but as calcium carbonate, (Whatever percentage that has been recognised by industry standards as being calcium carbonate and not limestone) then it would be eligible.</PARA>
<PARA>People tell me that there is not an industry standard. They say to customs, `What do you mean by industry standards? Who makes the standard?' There are different definitions of calcium carbonate in the various state acts dealing with mining. They are not consistent, but I do not think it is the point. In this particular instance the person who has given me this, customs goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now with your crushing, if the crushing process further enhances (improves&mdash;such as more concentrated&mdash;this is just not blending or making in a saleable product) the calcium carbonate (not limestone) then it is eligible for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I hope that the parliamentary secretary in his reply to the second reading debate will be able to say to me, `Yes, that is quite correct&mdash;providing you are crushing it, getting it to that finer stage so that it contacts with the soil in a greater area, then that is used as calcium carbonate, it is a mineral and therefore is eligible for the rebate.' I suspect that the government, in addressing this whole problem, did not focus as clearly on the environmental effects of the increase in the cost of production of limestone or on the effects on our agricultural exports. I am fairly certain&mdash;I am sure the parliamentary secretary would agree with me&mdash;that the government would not want to do anything that made it more difficult to address real environmental problems. Certainly, they would not want to do anything which would further debilitate our export earning ability from rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the parliamentary secretary or the advisers can clarify those issues. I did put some of those questions on notice last night or early this morning. If we can get that clarified, as I say, it may well shorten the already short hearing into this matter when the committee meets on Friday. I know that, because of the environmental aspects of it, both the Greens (WA) and the Democrats would be very interested in the limestone issue. I am sure the government would also be interested in clarifying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention that limestone is not only used to treat acid soils but it is also used fairly widely in treating cyanide ponds that result from mining activities of many years ago. Apparently, you can use this limestone to leach out all the harmful effects of those cyanide ponds. So it is a very necessary and useful material. We should be reducing the cost of it rather than adding to it. I hope that in my unlearned way I have got that message across and we can get a response from the parliamentary secretary that will clarify the issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995 will give effect to a number of initiatives announced in the 1995 budget, principally the maternity allowance, and introduce a single family payment. The legislation involves changes to the Social Security Act 1991, the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five measures incorporated in this bill. I will list them. The maternity allowance will be introduced to assist families with the additional costs incurred at the time of the birth of a baby, including reduced family income. The two existing payments of basic family payment and additional family payment will be amalgamated into a single family payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to align the income and asset levels and indexation arrangements of family payment and Austudy. Amendments are included to increase the responsiveness of the family payment income test rule. Also, from 1 January 1996, family payment is to be payable to whichever member of a couple is the primary carer of a child. The coalition will not be opposing these measures. However, I would like to comment on a number of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Closer examination of the measures contained in this bill reveals that it is yet again a cynical exercise on the part of the government to hoodwink the Australian public into believing that the government is genuinely concerned about the welfare of families. If you look at the financial impact of each of the matters that have been addressed, other than the maternity allowance, you will find that in the main they are of very modest proportions and some of them, while they are held out to be beneficial to families, will have an adverse impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you exclude the maternity allowance, the bill produces savings to the government; it does not produce new benefits to families. In particular, when you get to the increased responsiveness of the family payment income test, a large number of families lose benefits by the alignment of the adjustments that are made. Those who have received adjustments under average weekly earnings and now come to get them under the CPI will receive less in the nature of support than they received previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the maternity allowance, this is the most expensive item in terms of its financial impact. It will cost $78 million in the first year, and $184 million in the second and third years. The introduction of the maternity allowance is a further breach of good faith with the Australian public. The maternity allowance was heralded as part of the Accord Mark VII, which was announced on 19 February 1993, just before the last election. The Accord stated that the government would consider the introduction of a maternity allowance in accordance with the International Labour Organisation convention 103 entitled `Maternity protection'. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) also made a statement to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This turned out, like many other promises we had before the 1993 election, to be a total misrepresentation of what the government was actually going to do. It was a promise the Prime Minister either never intended to keep or had to break. The Australian public will have to be the judge of that. The government has all the resources to do the figures beforehand. It made a promise and it has broken it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the budget approached, it became clear that the government was not going to be able to honour that undertaking and it scuttled off to the ACTU, the other arm of government, to strike a new deal in relation to the allowance in exchange for an increase in the wage safety net. People were given less in the way of a salary and wage increase under the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, they were promised there would be this maternity allowance in a budget that would follow, but it was not to be the same maternity allowance as promised before the 1993 election. If the maternity allowance had been implemented in accordance with the ILO convention, as the Prime Minister promised, it would have been for a period of 12 weeks. Instead, it is now to be for a period of six weeks and it is to be means tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You really cannot believe anything Mr Keating promises or says. The government promised before the election that the maternity allowance would be for 12 weeks; now we find it is only for six weeks. If the Prime Minister could find the money for only six weeks, why didn't he tell the Australian people before the election? That is the point. The Prime Minister was again toying with the emotions of families by promising them a payment and then changing the eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw him do the same thing before the election, telling women they were going to get this enormous amount of money. In fact they found out it was just over $2.70. The government took another benefit off them, rejigged it, gave them $2.75&mdash;whacko, a whole new benefit. Talk about pea and thimble, lies and fibs before the election and, suddenly, the Australian public find out afterwards that this 12-week maternity allowance is now going to be only six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said that it was going to review the allowance to bring it into line with the ILO convention at some point in time up to 1989. But can you trust a government that has broken so many promises? We had the tax cuts that were going to be l-a-w law. The first tranche was stretched out, the second never appeared or reappeared as superannuation. But what happened to self-funded retirees who do not get superannuation? They got left out. Effectively, the government said, `Forget about them. We made a promise but we will just ignore self-funded retirees'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever group you are in, you get done in by this government in their promises before an election. You cannot trust a government that has broken so many of its promises. This bill is just another example of the government's lamentable record. It does not measure up to the government's promise, it does not measure up to community expectations and it should be understood for what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family payment presently consists of two components&mdash;basic and additional. They have similar payability and qualification rules but different rate structures and different income and assets tests. The Department of Social Security says that the payments are to be amalgamated to improve customer understanding. It states that there will be no changes to payments received by customers and eligibility will not be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure is an attempt by the government to simplify their complicated payment system. Over a period of time, a number of welfare organisations have argued that the family payment system generally is in need of reform. Social Security has just been on a $200 million spending spree, producing an explanatory booklet that it has mailed out to all social security recipients. Obviously, the system is in need of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a host of different support regimes in place: the child-care cash rebate; the home child-care allowance, which has now been subsumed into the parenting allowance; and the family payment system or, if you go outside it to other areas, child support arrangements. Each of them, in many cases, operates within different departments, each of them has different rules for eligibility and each of them provides an ad hoc arrangement for payment of family support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition agrees that this complicated system is in need of comprehensive review. The system cannot continue as it is. It is becoming increasingly complex, with different criteria applying to different benefits. I think the government also accepts that the system cannot continue as it is and recognises that changes need to be made but it finds the process of embarking upon such fundamental reform far too difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amalgamation of basic and additional family payment is an illustration of the ineptitude of the government when it comes to such reform. The government proposes under this legislation to merge the basic and additional family payment into one payment, with the same qualification rules but different rate structures and different income and assets tests. As a colleague in the House of Representatives has stated, about the only things that have changed are a title and a form. Contrary to any expectation, the change is next to negligible in terms of any fundamental reform of the system. It ought to be understood that this is another failure of the government to address the hard issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three other measures covered in this bill. First, aligning the income and assets levels in indexation arrangements for family payment and Austudy. Second, amendments to increase the responsiveness of the family payment income test. Thirdly, from 1 January 1996 family payments are to be payable to whichever member of a couple is the primary carer of a child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition does not oppose these proposals, especially those in relation to the responsiveness of the family payment income test and the family payment being made to the primary care giver, I point out that the alignment of the income and assets levels in indexation arrangements for Austudy will have an adverse effect on many people. As mentioned previously, if you exclude maternity allowance, this bill actually produces savings to the government. Apart from the maternity allowance, it does not provide new benefits to families. The minister in his second reading speech quoted from the Agenda for Families, in which the Prime Minister noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . families are the basic building blocks of our national life. They provide care like no government or any other agency ever can. They are the most important providers of education, health, welfare and personal development. Families nourish our potential, and nurture our individual and collective aspirations. They shape our character and pass on our values. They create a sense of belonging and continuity . . . Because the welfare of our people and the strength of our communities and our nation depend on families, governments have a duty to support them.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how the Prime Minister can be so hypocritical that he can say this, and yet introduce policy after policy and broken promise after broken promise which have left families in an increasingly dependent state and less well off. That is what has happened after 13 years of Labor. Families are increasingly dependent, and they are less well off. Yet the Prime Minister has the hide to actually, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agenda for Families</EMPHASIS>, make that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of points that need to be made about this government and families. First, its neglect of the welfare of families and its inability to deal with the increasing gap between rich and poor. The government's neglect of the welfare of families is evidenced by its inability to deal with the increasing inequality between the haves and the have-nots, the rich and the poor. I have spoken a number of times in this place about the increasing gap between those families who are able to manage financially and those families who are finding it more and more of a struggle every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to go no further than a report into poverty in Queensland a couple of months ago which emphasised this fact. The report contained a number of damning statistics, which illustrates the government's failure to assist the disadvantaged. I will just outline some of the things that study found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland had the lowest average weekly disposable income at $550 a week. Sole parent families, couples with three or more children and young single people have the greatest chance of being in poverty. One-fifth of the Queensland population lives in poverty; 18 per cent live below the poverty line; and 26 per cent of those in poverty are children. We were going to have no children living in poverty by the year 1990, if you believed Mr Hawke. Twenty-six per cent, a quarter of Queensland's children&mdash;and I do not have the figures here about the rest of Australia&mdash;live in poverty. No child was going to live in poverty, if you believed the previous Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics showed that 27.2 per cent of elderly people live in poverty. Over a quarter of older Australians living in Queensland are living in poverty. Two in three sole parents exist below the poverty line. Two out of three families being reared by sole parents live below the poverty line. I hope the government is proud of that record and what it has done for families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that I want to make is the government's failure to introduce, as promised, a maternity allowance, as outlined in Accord Mark VII, and the postponement of any future effort to do so until 1999 in Accord Mark VIII. So the world will be a great place after the year 2000, if you believe this government. You will have some superannuation. If you are 25, you will be able to start on the full superannuation scheme. If you are a mother having a baby, you will get the maternity allowance by the year 2000. All these promises the government make they then extend out into the never-never. We ought to call it the never-never Labor government policy, because you wait for the never-never to see those policies come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would bet that if they ever get the chance of being in government after the next election&mdash;which I doubt, and I hope they do not, and I am working hard to make sure they do not&mdash;mothers will be unlikely to see that by 1999. There will be some other excuse. There be will be some pea and thimble trick. The Prime Minister will say, `Well, look, we didn't mean to say that. We'll give you something else. We'll convert it into some other benefit. We'll give it a new name. We'll doctor it up. We'll polish it up into some sort of flashy policy, and we'll tell you it's all new.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that the government has misled the Australian public through the introduction of a number of measures affecting families which had not been announced and had not been policy prior to the 1993 election but were introduced after that election. After the last election, Labor introduced a number of measures for families which were not announced prior to the election. There is every possibility that the government will go down the same path after the next election. They do not change their spots, just as leopards do not change their spots. On the one hand they promise a whole swag of things and they either do not give them or tone them down, and on the other hand they say that they are not going to do certain things and suddenly after the election we find that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the government introduced no less than 10 new social security changes to the system which had not been announced before or during the 1993 election campaign. This information was deceitfully held from the voters. Some of these measures included reducing the income ceiling and assets value for the basic family payment, resulting in an estimated 118,000 families being excluded from the basic family payment. We did not see that on their brochures; we did not hear that mentioned in the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to the last election with the most honest statement which could ever be put before the Australian public. We told them the good things and we told them the bad things. We told them the things we would have to do to turn this country around. What did this government do? It lied to the Australian public. It told them it was going to do things and then reneged on them and it did not tell them about other things it was going to do. The government did not tell the public it was going to include foreign payments in the income test for families, apply the income assets test to students' parents and change the rules relating to payment of overseas pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for me to go back over the government's record on this issue. All of these measures were quite cynically taken up by the government after the election. None of them was foreshadowed in the quite voluminous policy documents purported to be the government's mandate for the 1993 election. These were clearly matters about which the government had had advice and for which it had been preparing the scene well in advance of 1993. They knew what they were going to do. Is that the intention of this government as we move closer to the next election? Have they got things up their sleeves which will be released onto an unsuspecting public after the election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let the Australian public be warned of their record in the last election, because they will be no different this time. How many policies will Labor walk away from immediately after the next election? They told pensioners five days after the last election, `Oh, we didn't mean to tell you that we were going to take you out of the tax system by 1995. That was a mistake.' They said that five days after the election. They have walked away from promise after promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the retiring age for women? We honestly told people that we could not afford to have Australian women on the pension at age 60, that we would be increasing the age. We told them that before the election. What did Neal Blewett, the then Minister for Social Security, do? He made it very clear that was not part of Labor's agenda. He mocked us and said it was atrocious, what a terrible thing we were doing to Australian women. And what did Labor do straight after the election? They brought in legislation to increase the pension age for women. They lied to the Australian public, to Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating got up after the election and said, `We thank the Australian women for voting us back in.' The government lied to Australian women. They mocked us; they criticised us. They did everything to denigrate our policies, including the policy of increasing the pension age for women, and they did it straight after the election. Time and again they have deceived the most vulnerable people in our community. They have trifled with their emotions. They have given assurances to them and walked away from them. I hope Australians remember the dishonesty of the people over on that bench in the lead-up to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure in this year's budget that the government has failed to deliver relates to assistance for families. It has deferred until 1996 implementation of a modest measure in rent assistance and the guardian allowance. I could go on about some of the other promises that were stretched out but I do not have time. Making more families depend on social security is not the answer. The answer is to initiate policies which enable, encourage and support the majority of families to live independently from government support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995, which contains, in the Greens' view, a number of worthwhile measures. Specifically, the bill gives legislative effect to the government's decision to pay a maternity allowance of $816 upon the birth of a child born to or adopted by a family which is eligible for the basic family payment or additional family payment. In the context of the government's family income support measures, this initiative has been welcomed by most people in the community, and rightly so. I will come back to the maternity allowance in a moment because there are aspects about its administration which cause concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill goes on to provide for the amalgamation of the basic family payment and the additional family payment&mdash;again, a worthwhile initiative. This is particularly to be welcomed because it also gives effect in this crucial area of income support to the minister's advocacy of a simpler social security system. In that regard, it is in sharp contrast to the proposed administration of the maternity allowance. The bill goes on to make changes to the family payment rates calculators&mdash;again, seemingly in line with attempts to simplify the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also aligns the income and assets free areas for family payment and Austudy, another move towards simplification. Lastly, the bill makes the administration of family payment more responsive to the income changes which many families experience. This is particularly welcome as many families find that the present structure of annual changes, or  changes only when income changes by a factor of 25 per cent, leaves them out of pocket for long periods of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is to be congratulated on any move to simplify the social security system and so we applaud such moves in this bill. I know that the minister has put considerable energy behind efforts to bring about these simplifications and it is to be hoped that there will be more to come. I will now come back to the maternity allowance because it is the one part of the bill which runs counter to that simplification trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To express my concern in its essence, I would want to ask the minister why the maternity allowance could not simply be paid by means of an over-the-counter cheque at a local DSS office when a person presents with a birth certificate and suitable identification. I am sure my question will draw howls of protest, not to say derision, from the department itself, from the minister and possibly even my colleagues. To quote Sir Humphrey, it would be `the end of civilisation as we know it'!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that there is a fundamental flaw in the implication behind my question; namely, that the allowance is not universal. The government estimates that 223,000 such allowances will be paid each year, or on about 85 per cent of all births. Naturally, there is a significant difference in the amount that would be paid if the allowance were universal. It is a difference of approximately $30 million in a full year and I am not suggesting that we go down that path. However, that alone is not sufficient justification for this overly complex piece of drafting. I am led to believe that application for the allowance will be included in the family payment form, which begs the question: why do we have to have these 10 pages of legislation ostensibly to place a box on an existing DSS form?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maternity allowance module, which the bill creates of course, provides for all the usual intrusions, including the need for the person and their partner to provide their tax file numbers and various other details. I particularly object to the inclusion of the tax file number requirements here as they are not even couched in language which allows the government to say that people are not required to provide their tax file number. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we need all this when the qualification for the maternity allowance is so simple? After all, every bit of the information sought in the new module will already be on file in the form of the person's application for family payment. Why are we setting up a new module for which the qualification criteria are set out quite succinctly in the explanatory memorandum and the minister's second reading speech? That speech said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All families who meet the family payment residency and income and assets tests will qualify for maternity allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is all this needed just to add a single box, paragraph or line on the family payment form? After all, adding a newborn child to a Medicare card to entitle that child to medical care within that system takes only a tick in a box. Why could the maternity allowance not be made a part of the family payment module? I can guess that, if I were to put my questions to the minister and his department, I would receive one of the following responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first response might be: `Each payment type or allowance in the act is structured as a separate module. Therefore, we have to structure this new payment in the same way with all the attendant questions, particulars and details.' To which I would have to reply: `That may well be the case but, since payment in this case is a once only event and qualification is tied to the family payment, it must be possible to make this simpler.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second response might be: `We have to ensure that we do not pay maternity allowance to someone who is not qualified for it.' To which I would have to reply: `But that is already taken care of by the assessment of the claim for family payment.' Or the third response might be: `We couldn't possibly pay it by a cheque over the counter because that is contrary to the way the payment system has moved over the years.' To which I would have to reply: `That may be so, but the way this is structured will inevitably cost far more to administer than payment by cheque, especially as this is a once only payment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the risk of providing ammunition to those who still regard the Greens as fairies at the bottom of the garden&mdash;and I think the number of those people are diminishing, but there are still a few left&mdash;I would like to see the payment of the maternity allowance provide an opportunity for celebration at DSS offices, and goodness knows there seems to be precious few of those. Why shouldn't the local office manager be empowered to provide a cheque in a suitable card&mdash;a birthday card perhaps&mdash;making it akin to the way we celebrate a migrant taking on Australian citizenship?</PARA>

Even though $816 will not really be that much when you consider the overall expenditure on a newborn child, it might be a way of lightening and improving the perception of the department in the eyes of many of its allowance recipients. I believe that the way this measure has been drafted runs completely counter to the minister's commitment to simplifying the social security system. In the words of the latest edition of the `Rights Review' by the Welfare Rights Centre, the social security system is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a system which, after 48 years, has not managed to develop a single, generic claim form to allow DSS staff to assess the most appropriate payment for an individual. Instead, there is a pick-a-box system, with over 25 pigeon holes, each with its own elaborate set of rules with the claimant responsible for picking the right payment first off.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995 which, as my colleague Senator Patterson said, we do not oppose. I would like to make a number of comments on proposals contained in this bill and on the general issues relating to government assistance to families. The major aspect of this bill is the maternity allowance, and people have focused upon that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that the maternity allowance itself has had a rather tortured birth. It was originally meant to be part of Accord Mark VII and was to be work related and a non-income tested 12-week payment. All the hopes and aspirations that the unions may have had for this part of Accord Mark VII have been dashed. There was a lot of community concern about the original framing of the allowance, because there was inherent discrimination against non-working mothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come back to the debate we had earlier this week about what the government is doing with child care. Again, the original proposal on the maternity allowance was to seek to draw this extraordinary distinction between mothers in `paid work' and mothers in `non-paid work'. There was a lot of reaction. The government has wilted in the face of that reaction and has now brought in the maternity allowance on a basis which we think is much more acceptable. It will be paid regardless of the work status of the mother, which we believe overcomes one of the major problems we thought was inherent in the original proposal; and it will be subject to an income and asset test, which we think is most appropriate. On that basis, we welcome the payment and support the maternity allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think Senator Chamarette, who has now departed, had a point in saying that it, of itself, does add now again to the complexity of the family assistance programs&mdash;and that is the oddity in this bill: we have one measure in this bill designed to simplify the system, and another measure which will make it more complex. The complexity of the system is a major issue, as I think Senator Chamarette pointed out very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we support the allowance itself, one does wonder whether all options were looked at as to how one could assist young families on the birth of a child, without creating a whole new allowance and a whole new bureaucracy to administer it. It was wondered whether it could be done as part of the family payment system, which I think the government is now moving towards being the core, the main vehicle of assisting families; perhaps it could have been built around that. That is something I think worth looking at, but that is not to deny our support for what is being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do believe that Australians have good reason to be cynical about the payment of the allowance. The fact that the payment will commence being paid on 1 February 1996 really does raise eyebrows right across Australia, given the coincidence of the timing of that payment with the due date for a federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major element of the bill is the amalgamation of the basic and additional family payments. This really does represent a belated, albeit welcome, government response to the increasing complaints about the confusion and complexity of the family assistance programs that the government administers. I would refer to some of the reaction to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's own National Council for the International Year of the Family, in its quite interesting report to the parliament, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was also felt that simplification of the system of family payments would enhance access and clarify entitlements as many parents expressed confusion about the range of available payments.</PARA>
<PARA>Any one of us with an electoral office which tries to help voters will be well aware of the extraordinary confusion people have about the payments available&mdash;and, again, Senator Chamarette identified them very well. There was an interesting piece by Tom Dusevic in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> only recently. He is that paper's social welfare writer. He pointed to this problem, I thought, quite effectively. He said in that article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social engineering in Australia is a mishmash, with conflicting goals, muddy rationales and perverse outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So-called "family friendly" policies subsidise the cost of rearing children through the tax and benefit system; favour the notion of two working parents; and generally are geared to helping the poorest families, especially those headed by sole parents, the fastest growing type.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the social system does not reward or encourage marriage, sometimes undermines the nuclear family, and often erodes the work ethic and keeps people on welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an independent observer of the social security system pointing to what is an extremely complex, confusing system that the government presides over. Sure, the government is spending a lot of money on family assistance&mdash;and, as a party that strongly supports assisting families, we support that. But the way in which the money is expended with the programs the government administers leaves a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we do welcome this bill's amalgamation of the basic and family payments system. It is a sensible move; it will help simplify the system. Of course, the payments were just one payment, until the government, in another election move at a previous election, decided to split them and create the additional family payment. Now they have brought them back together again, which will make it more user friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those two measures in this bill are to be welcomed. But I would take this opportunity to express my disappointment that this is as far as the government has gone; that this is the limit of the government's reform program to help families with children. We think these are only a couple of small steps down a path which the government should be proceeding but which it shows no signs of proceeding down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I am extremely disappointed that so far the government has done absolutely nothing to end one of the most discriminatory aspects of its policy program in relation to families&mdash;and it is an inequity which I have pointed to many times before and I will keep drawing attention to it until the government does something about it&mdash;and that is the gross inequity in the treatment of young families with children that is inherent in the operation of the home child-care allowance, now rolled into the parenting allowance, and the child-care cash rebate. I have, as I said, spoken on this subject many times and I will keep speaking on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those policy programs emerged a couple of years ago it aroused an enormous bushfire of community concern. There are nationwide movements now propelled by the incredible inequities that are inherent in the operation of those two payments. I want to remind the Senate of the inequity we are talking about. The home child-care allowance, which I will call it for the purposes of distinguishing it from the other half of the parenting allowance, for a mother of two means that she can receive a maximum of $30.50 per week. There is a very strict income test on eligibility. If the recipient earns more than $30 a week, the benefit starts to reduce. I think it cuts out completely at around $85 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, child-care cash rebate for a mother of two amounts to a maximum of $61.20 a week&mdash;twice the amount that a mother of two on the home child-care allowance receives. Of course, with the child-care cash rebate there is no income test whatsoever. It is paid regardless of the income of the recipient. It would seem to be designed for wealthy, two income families working in the Public Service in Canberra. Two parents working in the bureaucracy in Canberra earning $60,000 or $70,000 each a year&mdash;a family income of about $140,000&mdash;will receive up to $61.20 a week from the taxpayer to pay for their child care. This is an extraordinary inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is so deceptive of the government. If you read the literature on the home child-care allowance, you will see that they disguise all this by referring to it being a payment of $61.20 a fortnight so that it appears to be the same as the payment that is made under the child-care cash rebate&mdash;but that is $61.20 a week. So they cleverly disguise the fact that it is half the value, which I think is grossly deceptive and scandalous in the way they try to deceive mothers, as Senator Patterson said about this issue in her speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think this is a dreadful inequity. It is a deliberate bias, in our view, against a mother who sacrifices her income to care for her children at home. It is a significant sacrifice that many mothers in this community still make, despite government policy seeming to be very much favoured towards the choice of full-time work and putting your child in child care. The fact is that single income families who make that choice of sacrificing one parent's income for full-time care of the child are subsidising child care for the rich via the operation of these two payments. We think that is grossly inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the child-care cash rebate was first proposed, we said very strongly that it should be income tested to ensure that there was not this kind of inequity operating. The government of course overrode that to ensure that it would be payable to anybody, no matter their income&mdash;no matter whether they are two solicitors in Sydney both earning $300,000 a year, they can still earn this money from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just us complaining about this. Peter Walsh, your former finance minister, has complained about this long and hard. The government's own advisory body, the National Council for the International Year of the Family, to which I have already referred, drew attention to these problems in its report. This is a government body with people on it appointed by the government. Their report, which makes good reading, criticised the operation of these two payments, albeit in a couched manner, because it was a government report. But it was quite clear what they were talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said in that report that there was `a compelling case for restructuring the system of family income support payments in families with young children under the age of six.' In other words, they are saying that the system is wrong and it needs restructuring. The report said, `The National Council believes that the principle of choice to remain outside of paid work or to combine paid work with employment should be made effective for parents of preschool children.' That is Chinese for saying that choice is not effective at the moment. They have said that the principle of choice to remain outside of paid work should be made effective. In other words, it is not effective right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that government policy is designed to reward the parents of young children who choose to undergo full-time paid work. The fact is that it penalises the choice of parents who sacrifice income in order to care for their young children. As I said, the national council drew attention to this problem in a very effective way and recommended the amalgamation of the child-care cash rebate and the home child-care allowance into a new payment, which it called the child-care payment. That was their method of overcoming what they said was a major problem in the operation of these two payments. So I am not saying this; it is the government's own advisory body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national council specifically made the point that the new payment would provide recognition of the unpaid work of care which all carers undertake. In other words, they are drawing attention to the fact that the current system of payments does not do that; it does not provide recognition of the unpaid work of carers. Full-time care of children by parents is not properly recognised by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national council wanted this child-care payment to be paid without any income or assets test. They wanted it to be paid at a rate similar to that of the home child-care allowance. The government has said that the problem with that proposal is that it would be expensive, and we agree. It is not realistic to make such a payment universal. We have criticised the child-care cash rebate because it is universal. We accept that the national council's proposal cannot be universal. We believe that, if you were going to do something like that, it would have to be subject to an income and assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that what the national council has said to the government&mdash;that is, that it should amalgamate these two payments into one child-care payment paid regardless of the work status of the parents&mdash;is worthy of consideration. We urge the government to consider that proposal. That is not the only way to go in order to overcome this anomaly. If you are going to have a tax rebate system, which is what the government says it wants, you could make that apply to child care and pay it regardless of the work status of the two parents. You have to keep the focus on children. One of our criticisms of the government is that it does not keep the focus on children. You are discriminating against children whose parents work full-time. You need to approach this issue on the basis of not discriminating in that way. You could have a tax rebate which does not discriminate on the basis of the work status of the parents. That would be another way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary goal must be to end this discrimination against families who care for their own preschool children. That discrimination exists and has been pointed to by the government's own advisers. This issue was a key concern raised with the coalition's own Lyons Forum when it had a recent inquiry into family policy. The report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Empowering Australian families</EMPHASIS> summarised the concerns raised in the course of our inquiry by families and family organisations right across Australia. It was a bipartisan look at the operation of family policy at the moment. It pointed to this particular problem. We got a lot of submissions across Australia from a wide variety of groups which pointed to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is that we are not seeking special treatment for single income families in the design of the policy. What we are seeking in pursuing this issue is neutrality in government policy. We want a non-discriminatory family policy. In the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill the other day, we argued that we want the government to end age discrimination. We want the government to end its discriminatory family policy and to have a non-discriminatory family policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the government should be seeking to maximise&mdash;not restrict&mdash;the choice available to families as to how they bring up their children. I refer to what Barry Maley, in his very good book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marriage, divorce and family justice</EMPHASIS>, had to say on this subject, and all members of parliament would be well advised to read this book. In chapter 11, which deals with child care, he concluded with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all parents of dependent children should be treated equally; all should be entitled to the same level of subsidy or tax concessions in respect of each child; and no group's treatment or concessions should be made conditional upon making career or family choices favoured by the state.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think the point I am trying to make could be said better than it was said by Maley in that book. We continue to urge the government to go down that path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I reiterate that the introduction of the maternity allowance and the amalgamation of the two payments under the family payment system into a single family payment are supported by us. My point is to draw attention to the fact that the government has so far failed to address the other problems in the family assistance program and, in particular, the failure to address what we believe is an unacceptable inequity in the operation of the old home child-care allowance, now part of the parenting allowance, and the child care cash rebate which, as I said, is not just our complaint but the complaint of its own National Council for the International Year of the Family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government policy does interfere in the choices that families make about the care of their children. It does bias choice in one direction and penalises an alternative choice. We think that is unacceptable. As I said, our position is supported by your own national council. So this bill makes a small step towards overcoming what we believe are a number of problems inherent in the government's family assistance programs, but it does not go nearly far enough.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995 seeks to put in place a range of measures proposed in the budget to provide social security assistance to families. During those budget sessions and over the last fortnight at the women's conference in Beijing we heard a lot about this government's commitment to families. This bill exposes the fact that in too many areas Australia is well behind the rest of the industrialised world in achieving a better balance between working women and men and family responsibilities. A key failing is that Australia presently shares with the United States the dubious honour of being the only industrialised country not to provide paid maternity leave. From February next year&mdash;and the introduction of this $816 baby bonus&mdash;we will leave the United States at the bottom of the list and move up to providing only the second worst level of support to new mothers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one tick that is due to the government&mdash;that is, I think it is true that we do have some very well targeted family payments. This bill does help remove some of the confusion surrounding family payments by combining additional family payments and basic family payments. This is a welcome initiative. At an annual average cost of $1.8 million over three years, it can hardly be described as extremely generous or radical. Indeed, the benefit of the combination of the payments is more than offset by the full year savings of $16.5 million from the other measures modifying the income and assets test for family payments in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing that the government has declined to improve the support provided to low income families. The last time the additional family payment was increased was in the wash-up to the 1993 budget and under pressure from the Democrats and the Greens in the Senate. In this budget I am pleased to see that the government has finally responded to the increasingly stringent concern from ACOSS and welfare groups as they have outlined the dire financial position of sole parent families. The government has agreed to increase the guardians allowance by a grand total of $2 a week from the dim and distant date of 1 September 1996. So from now until then, tens of thousands of sole parent families will have to wait until the government gives them what is equivalent to another loaf of bread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other key measures in the so-called family friendly budget included savings of over $262 million in child-care assistance over the next four years at a time when women are still saying that they cannot find enough child-care places. By raising these issues, I want to make it clear that the Democrats believe that the government still has a great deal of work to do to address the key issue of achieving a better balance between work and family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key measure in this bill is the baby bonus or, more correctly put, the lump sum maternity allowance which is to be set at six times the parenting allowance, in turn equal to the spouse's rate of unemployment benefits. It is the Democrats view that this level of support falls well short of the obligations under international treaties&mdash;treaties that Australia is unable to ratify because of our poor performance and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key convention is ILO convention 103 concerning maternity protection, which requires member nations to provide, by national legislation, an entitlement to at least 12 weeks maternity leave, generally at a rate of at least two-thirds or more of a woman's previous earnings. The ILO now recommends a period of paid leave of at least 14 weeks at 100 per cent of previous earnings. Similarly, the European Commission issued a directive in October 1992 to encourage the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who had recently given birth. European Community members are now required to guarantee paid maternity leave of at least 14 weeks, paid at the statutory rate of sick leave, which in most member countries is 75 per cent of previous pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many European countries have gone much further. Sweden provides up to 15 months paid parental leave available to either the mother or the father. This, combined with up to 60 days paid carer's leave a year and widespread provision of child care, has given Sweden the highest female labour force participation rate in the world. In Germany, the law provides for 14 to 18 weeks at basically full pay. In the United Kingdom, it is 18 weeks&mdash;six weeks at 90 per cent of pay and 12 weeks at a fixed allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Germany, of course, also allows a parent who stays at home to look after their child to keep many of the benefits and securities of their previous job. In Canada, paid maternity leave ranges from a minimum of 15 weeks at 60 per cent of salary to as many as 26 weeks at full pay in the federal wages jurisdiction. Closer to home, Japan provides 14 weeks leave paid at 60 per cent of earnings, Taiwan and Singapore, eight weeks on full pay and Hong Kong, 10 weeks on two-thirds pay. The point of ranging across those examples is to say that this is no you-beaut, super deal. It is a step forward but it is not deserving, I think, of the gloss that has been put on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, in a little known exception, Australia has failed to ratify article 11(2)(b) of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which binds states to take all appropriate means to introduce maternity leave with pay or with comparable social benefits without loss of employment, seniority or social benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As can be seen when this bill is passed, we will be providing for six weeks pay at effectively 23 per cent of average weekly earnings of full-time women workers. This is really quite pathetically short of the mark. It falls well short not just of international best practice&mdash;which is something we like to pluck out of the air as it applies to other things when it suits us&mdash;but also of the performance of virtually all industrialised countries. It falls well short of even the minimalist position demanded by the ACTU in Accord  VII and by the Year of the Family Committee headed by Bettina Cass of 12 weeks pay or the equivalent of unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Accord VII, the government was supposed to deliver paid maternity leave by implementing ILO convention 103. The delivery in the 1995 budget is clearly well short of what was promised and expected. Australian women who are wondering when Australia will live up to its international obligations must be disappointed that the ACTU has let the government off the hook in Accord VIII, signed two months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these points because the ACTU is usually a very fierce defender of ILO conventions. The same ACTU which is asking the government not to deliver the ILO recommendation of 14 weeks leave at 100 per cent of salary or even to ratify ILO convention 103, is saying, `Look, it's okay, just get into the spirit of it, just show that you're delivering something.' And that something is the $816 baby bonus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall the ACTU welcoming the budget proposals on budget night as delivering support to those who need it, particularly women and families. But this was the same budget in which the government could find only $180 million to help Australian women and their families through the physically and financially stressful period of childbirth. In that same budget it was this government which could find $4.6 billion to prop up a superannuation deal with the ACTU&mdash;the overwhelming proportion of which will be paid to male workers earning up to $62,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that we do not have the same social contract climate of the European countries&mdash;I know and understand that. I know that we are clawing our way upwards. I know that people usually say we cannot afford to do it. But the full cost of providing maternity leave to women in the Australian work force represents just 0.2 per cent of total payroll, that is, less than a third of the amount companies pay for company cars for, mostly male and mostly managerial, employees. So you can make choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having seen the support that European countries are providing to working mothers during maternity, I think it is a bit embarrassing that this is the best that Australia can offer. This bill takes us only a small way or a part way towards the European standard. It takes us towards about 10 per cent of the entitlement. So at the committee stage I will be moving an amendment to allow us to at least come up to the minimal standards of Accord VIII and the spirit of the ILO convention to 12 weeks social security support over two budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I wish to compliment the government on one aspect of this bill: the recognition that maternity allowance should be paid to both women in the work force and women out of the work force. The period following the birth of a baby is financially stressful for any family, particularly where only one partner was previously in the work force. I am pleased the government has recognised this fact by not restricting that support to women in the work force. As I said, it is just a pity that the level of support is so low. </PARA>

It is interesting to note that the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Bill 1995 actually passes into law great good news for Australian families: the maternity allowance and the much better streamlined and simplified arrangements for payments to families.

But when comparing what we are doing now with what will happen after 1 February, this is a mighty advance&mdash;$816 to each family on the occasion of a birth of a baby after 1 February, and it will probably be marginally more than that by that time.

If you are a reforming government and concerned about getting it right for the community, you are always pleased to introduce initiatives and benefits to the community. This is great good news.

That is a very nice way of putting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise the costs to families at the time of a birth of a child. It is a very useful, very significant watershed type, payment. Those of us who are old enough might remember that we used to have a maternity payment years back. It got lost; it was removed, taken away. Now there is a payment to Australian families produced by the government in recognition of the costs at the time of having a baby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard Senator Minchin say&mdash;and I think he is really having a shot at me; he usually is&mdash;that I am wrong when I say on the government's behalf that it does not interfere with what families are doing. We do not dictate to families how they sort out arrangements between themselves. We do not dictate to families whether they should be in the work force or not. Senator Minchin says, `Of course you do because of the payments you give them.' But apparently in this case that is not so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin is not suggesting that the maternity allowance will lead to massive breeding of the Australian people. He apparently does not see the argument for interference applying here. It only applies with the one bee in his bonnet about whether or not we are forcing people into the work force. It is tired argument, Senator Minchin, and I will deal with that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maternity allowance is a great benefit payment. This is a payment that families of Australia will be very pleased to accept and will welcome. The streamlining and simplifying of the administrative arrangements will also be a great benefit to families. Certainly we recognise the complexities of those payments. That is why we have taken and will continue to take more and more steps over time to simplify and make those payments family friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the attention of the Senate the document released by Social Security and sent to so many families outlining the payments for families by this government&mdash;family payments, the child care payments and so on&mdash;so that families do understand what their entitlements are and what steps they might have to take to enjoy those benefits. I would hope that most people&mdash;and I am absolutely sure that most people&mdash;in seeing and reading that document will not feel that they are being manipulated but will feel that they are being recognised as having needs&mdash;the need to bear costs, the need of assistance that families have in this country. I would also hope that most people would recognise this government's great commitment to Australian families through payments, services and now, with the great initiative of this legislation, the maternity allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up on some of the points that Senator Minchin put out yet again, quoting somehow that we should treat all children the same. Out of context I could not say what that line really means. I know what I mean about how we help children. That goes to another point mentioned by Senator Kernot&mdash;that is, targeting payments. That means we assist families with lower incomes in a different way from how we assist families with higher incomes. In other words, we do not treat all children the same. We are actually directing and skewering our assistance to families at the lower end of the income scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin keeps on with the idea that we are assisting families or directing families into the work force and that we provide more assistance to families when two parents are working than if one parent is at home. They are simply not the facts. Overall, this government's payments to Australian families, about $12 1/2 billion, are very significantly directed to single income working families and our low income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very important point to keep reminding the people of Australia that Senator Minchin got it wrong. The majority of Australian government payments to families go to single income and low income families. That is about the government's clear objectives and priorities about assisting families at the lower income end of the scale as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those payments are now amalgamated into one family payment, including the basic family payment and the additional family payment. The additional family payment is a very good payment of about $35 or $42, depending on whether children are up to 13 or older than 13. Those payments were set as benchmarks by this government a few years ago. That is an extraordinary initiative on behalf of recognising the costs of raising and having children. They were also indexed. We recognise that those costs do need to keep pace with the general cost of living in society. They are very generous, very excellent payments, now more easily provided to families than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Senator Chamarette thought that we might change the way the maternity allowance was made. I am sorry I did not hear Senator Chamarette's contribution but I understand that she was suggesting it could be paid as an over-the-counter cheque with a card saying, `Congratulations on having a baby.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that everybody in our society celebrates the birth of babes but it is appropriate to make sure payments to families, which is the main task of the Department of Social Security, are provided in the most efficient, effective and simple way. By and large, a cheque over the counter would not advantage most families and would certainly disadvantage many by them having to turn up and collect those cheques. It would also be very much more expensive for the department. If we are looking at efficiencies and the best way to assist families we would not want to be doing that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had a choice of moving two amendments. I had two drafted. The first one sought to double it immediately&mdash;to get the government to honour the promise that I believe it made, particularly via the Accord&mdash;but the amendment I am moving is actually more fiscally responsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard what Senator Crowley said about budget bottom lines and surpluses. The amendment I am moving actually leaves the allowance, the baby bonus, at $816 for 1995-96, but doubles it for 1996-97. It would cost $184 million&mdash;that is true&mdash;but it is this government which is trumpeting that we are going to be in hefty surplus in 1996-97, even counting asset sales. We are going to have a hefty surplus, so governments have choices, and here is the choice of honouring a commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think is philosophically wrong with the way the government has chosen to do this is this. A lump sum baby bonus takes away, in my view, from the argument of the legitimacy of an extended period of paid maternity leave. That is the choice. For me, that legitimacy is what is more important. Sure, the money in a lump sum will be helpful, but it does not address that period after a baby's birth when people need the financial security of knowing that there is going to be a continuing regular source of income. You can choose to say, `I'm going to divide that $816 over 12 or 14 weeks,' and it is not much. So that is what I think is philosophically a problem with the way the government has chosen to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, this amendment will cost zero in 1995-96; it will cost $184 million in 1996-97. It is this government that is talking up the amount of the surplus we are going to have. It is this government which can honour the commitment that it made via the Accord to do more to assist families in balancing work and family responsibilities. I see this as one important way of doing it. I seek leave to move my amendments together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were debating it on 22 August, so it has been around for a while. The Australian Democrats circulated an amendment yesterday. We were faxed the amendment yesterday and it was circulated in the chamber yesterday. I find it difficult that the Democrats produce an amendment for increased expenditure and expect the coalition to make a decision on the run without consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that the government, on 19 February 1993, prior to the election, through Accord Mark VII, intimated to the Australian public that there would be 12 weeks maternity leave, that there would be double the amount that they now give. As I said in my second reading contribution, that was a breach of good faith of the Australian public. The Australian public have to realise that the government they elect is the government they get. That is what the government promised before. That is what people expected. This is now what they are getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all due respect to you, Senator Kernot, we should sit down and add up&mdash;I have not done this exercise, but it is one we ought to do&mdash;every time we have come into the chamber on an issue where you have said, `It costs only $148 million. This will cost only another $500 million. This will cost only another $10 million. This will cost only another $12 million.' When we add that all up, we find that we have got budgetary problems. It is much easier for you to sit there and say, `We'll just spend a few more million here and a few more million there.' We have a debt we have to pay back. If we go into surplus, it is not money that we can go frivolously spending. This government has put this country into huge debt. I do not think the Democrats sit down and think very seriously about every time they come into this chamber with `just another amendment which will make a difference'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government promised before the election that this would be different. They have hoodwinked the Australian public, and I hope they are sorry about that. But, given the fact that the amendment came so late, given the fact that it has budgetary implications, given the fact that the government has reneged on its promise&mdash;that is what the Australian people have to live with&mdash;the coalition is not in a position to support the request of the Democrats. </PARA>

Again referring to that litany of where Australia stands compared to other countries, I am advised that it is relevant to take into account total support for low income families. Doing that in the comparison between countries, including European countries, makes Australia come out toward the top of the list of the most generous countries.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose we could get into a debate about what is in Senator Kernot's figures and what is in mine, but I just wanted to put that on the record. We are now specifically addressing the amendment moved by Senator Kernot on behalf of the Australian Democrats. While the government is going to reject that amendment, it may be of some encouragement to you, Senator, to know that the government is committed to reviewing the maternity allowance with a view to improving it or extending it as economic and budgetary circumstances permit, as set down in Accord Mark VIII with the ACTU and consistent with the spirit of ILO convention 103. That convention identifies 12 weeks maternity leave through social security arrangements as an appropriate goal. Doubling the rate of the maternity allowance, as you say, Senator, on today's figures is $184 million. That would make a total of $368 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will keep its commitment to review the maternity allowance but in the context of budgetary and economic circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. I wanted to be clear that that was not an absolute assurance that that was the case and you knew it to be so. What I am saying, though, is that the difficulty I have with your amendment is that it does put actual years in. It may well be that you are right and that by that time, within a year or two, there will be entirely appropriate budgetary and economic circumstances to allow the review and possible improvement of the maternity allowance. But it is not possible to accept an amendment that puts a time line on that at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted Senator Patterson saying that if we added up all the Democrat amendments they would come to a huge bill. I remind the Senate that Senator Patterson's opposition yesterday to the child-care bill is going to cost this government $140 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are the same party. It was your party that was opposing it. I do allow that the Democrats, in moving that amendment, are genuine about looking at the bill in November, but Senator Minchin and Senator Troeth, on behalf of the opposition, want to oppose the bill. They opposed it in the House of Representatives; they will oppose it in November. They have said that they will oppose it, but they are not going to just oppose it today so that they are not caught with being charged with dudding this government of $140 million over four years. That is just the sort of convenient figure that might assist in changing payments on the maternity allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moral high ground is a pretty dangerous place to try to get to. I am here on behalf of facts. We know how good they are. You can make your own assessment. The maternity allowance in this bill is a great improvement, a tremendous contribution to Australian families. It is $816 at the time of the birth of a baby, after 1 February next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the record is a commitment by this government to review that maternity allowance with a view to improving it once the economic and budgetary circumstances permit. I take the sentiment of your amendment. It is entirely in concurrence with the government's intention, but because there are specified years in there the government is not able to accept it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to address a couple of the points that have been made on the so-called high moral ground. Senator Patterson said that receiving the amendment yesterday has not given her sufficient time to consider it. The opposition is so selective about when this matters and when it does not, and the way in which they do unto others. I recall getting land fund bill amendments two seconds before we were to debate them. It happens that way. Twenty-four hours is a reasonable time to give attention to something like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you say that `You add up all the Democrats' promises and what they try to do,' you fail to acknowledge that we at least put to this government, and do regularly, a balanced, revenue neutral budget submission. We are prepared to say, `This is where we would raise the money and this is how we would spend it,' and we, I think, have a record of being fiscally responsible. You can look at the 27 commitments that John Howard and others on your side have already made in the course of not releasing policy, and those commitments are going to cost an awful lot of money, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no moral high ground to be gained by you or anybody else by saying, `There has not been enough time to consider it but the Democrats come in here and make all these amendments all the time without any regard for what they cost.' That simply is not true. As you and I know, governments and oppositions, and Democrats and everybody else, have the right to make political choices about the priority they will give to where they raise and where they spend public money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley said that the government will review this always as economic circumstances permit. Okay, but that is what it always says&mdash;`As economic circumstances permit we will review this measure.' What about the politics of it? What it really points to, in my view, disappointingly, is the lack of clout of women in this decision making process. I suspect that if there had been more women in the cabinet when it was decided that the government could only go this far, instead of going as far as it had promised, we would have had more of a fight. So it is disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that this is a fiscally irresponsible amendment, even if it does have the years specified. I did not expect opposition senators to support it. Why would they? I do not believe that it is their policy to embark upon paid maternity leave. I stress again: it is not the super-duper good news, excellent-excellent good news. But I am also realistic enough to know that women and families will welcome $816 compared with zero. However, I really would like to see this government get serious about formally legitimising the right to paid maternity leave. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes changes to the youth training allowance provisions of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. The youth training allowance is intended to replace the jobsearch allowance for young unemployed persons under the age of 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant policy agency for the youth training allowance is DEET and the relevant payment agency is the Department of Social Security. As a consequence, we have a cumbersome procedure whereby changes in the Social Security Act need to be constantly mirrored in the Student and Youth Assistance Act. At the time when the youth training allowance was substituted for the jobsearch allowance, the coalition expressed concern about the creation of unnecessary bureaucratic procedures with the two large departments, DEET and the Department of Social Security, dealing with one client group. This bill bears out the coalition's concern. Having dealt with many of the amendments in the social security bills&mdash;in particular, my colleague Senator Patterson has been involved in this&mdash;bills which have now passed the Senate, we have to revisit them in relation to the Student and Youth Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the proposed changes mirror amendments already made to the Social Security Act 1991 by way of the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. We have no difficulty with these amendments. Others of the proposed changes are intended to mirror amendments to the Social Security Act 1973. They have now been passed through the Senate, as I said, in the form of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 and the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. Our position on merit was put fully in that debate in the Senate. As a result of our arguments, the government made a number of concessions. Really, what it is doing, as I understand it, is mirroring those concessions in its decision to delete the schedules that I mentioned a moment ago from this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to schedule 3 and schedule 4 of the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995 is in part the mirror amendment of schedule 16 of Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 and relates to lump sum compensation and compensation recovery. We expressed in the debate under the social security legislation the concerns raised by the Welfare Rights Centre and others about the amendment on compensation recovery. The government has undertaken to clarify the administrative guidelines to the Social Security Act and to introduce a legislative amendment to address these concerns. As we said, we were satisfied with the undertakings that were given in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 6 of the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill 1995 relates to continuation, variation and termination of determinations. It is the mirror amendment to division 18 of the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Bill 1995. Our opposition to that was stated in the Senate in debate of the social security legislation. This amendment, in the view of the coalition, places an unreasonable onus on clients, a responsibility which is more appropriately placed with the department. We therefore indicated opposition to schedule 6. As I said, the government has now said that it is prepared to delete that, with the exception of item 7. We are therefore pleased that the government has made this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 7 relates to the power of the secretary to disclose client information. We understand this amendment mirrors proposed amendment to the Social Security Act which has been withdrawn. We are pleased to see that the government proposes an amendment to omit schedule 7 from this bill. Schedule 7, as it stood, would have allowed the secretary to disclose information not only to the secretary or head of the department or authority but also to staff. It also would have allowed the secretary to delegate his disclosure power. As we argued in here under the social security legislation, it is essential that the integrity of client information held by departments is upheld and strengthened, rather than weakened. We are therefore pleased to see that the government now intends to omit this schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, schedule 8 on the reviewability of some ministerial decisions relates to division 16 of the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. We earlier set out the coalition's opposition to this amendment. The coalition is concerned about the expansion of non-reviewable decisions. As we said earlier in the debate, the coalition believes that the parliament should be cautious in considering any widening of non-reviewable decisions. We therefore were opposed to schedule 8 of this bill and are pleased to see that the government has decided now to delete that schedule. On the basis of the government's decision to delete provisions which were subject to our objections, I therefore indicate on behalf of the coalition that we will support the passage of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill and the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill, which are being debated cognately. These bills will amend the Radiocommunications Act 1992.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this act, an apparatus licence may be issued for a five-year period. At present, the licensees must make an annual tax payment for the term of the licence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures before the Senate today will allow the Spectrum Management Agency to offer other options for the payment of these new licences. The coalition believes that this is a reasonable change. As a result, there will be a reduction in the administrative costs of the Spectrum Management Agency. Presumably, the administrative cost savings will also be passed to radiocommunications licensees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments introduce more flexible options. Significantly, no licensee will be forced to change their payment procedures by the SMA. If they want to continue with the old arrangements, they can, but they are now being offered new flexibility. The Spectrum Management Agency reviewed the radiocommunications apparatus licence in 1994. The review recommended a wide variety of payment options to be made available. The existing legislation offers only one way: the regular annual licence tax payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many licences are issued for periods in excess of one year. The annual administration of the licence tax adds unnecessarily to the cost burden of the operation of the SMA. The SMA review has properly identified the need for a more flexible payment of the tax. That flexibility is to allow the option of an up-front payment by the licensee, and that up-front payment can cover the term of the licence&mdash;not just for one year but for a maximum of five years. That change is most welcome. Where a licence is issued for 12 months or less, the fee will fall due, as currently is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apparatus licensing system will in future have three options for payment with licence terms exceeding 12 months&mdash;to pay up-front a lump sum fee; to transfer from the annual instalment method of payment by paying a lump sum amount to cover the balance of the license term of up to five years; or to simply stay with the present payment procedure of an annual fee plus an administrative charge for sending the annual notification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change that has been brought about by these bills relates to penalties. Under the old penalty system, they could just suspend and cancel the licence, which is a pretty brutal way of doing it. In the spirit of the flexibility of these bills, they have also changed the way in which penalties may be imposed. They are doing this because 40 per cent of the licence renewals are processed late because of late payment. It is a high figure, and new up-front payment fees might help to reduce this problem. The SMA will have the power to make disallowable instruments setting interest penalties on outstanding amounts. That is a welcome addition to the other formal ways of bringing in the money more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, the coalition supports the bill. The opportunity to reduce administrative costs and possibly more efficient collection of licence fees and the reduction of late payment to the SMA are welcome changes. The SMA estimates that, on the basis of the 1994-95 fiscal year, 10 per cent of the licences for the renewal make up for the up-front payment in the future. On the 1994-95 figure, 10 per cent take up of the licence revenue would increase from $94 million to $136 million per year. This increase would be offset with reductions in the following four years. The Australian Telecommunications Users Group supports the greater flexibility in the payment option. We hope that the administrative savings, with fewer payments being processed, are actually passed on to the people who are taking out the licences. We will be watching to see that the SMA does pass on any such savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My compliments to the SMA, which have so far been fairly extensive, will end at this point because the coalition is not particularly happy with some of the other ways in which schemes of the SMA are being administered at this time. I refer, in particular, to community radio stations and what is happening with the allocation of parts of the spectrum to these groups. The role of the SMA is to manage this process in an era of rapidly changing technology. There is enormous demand on the spectrum and this must be properly managed and people must be allocated licences in an orderly manner across various regions. We are questioning the way in which the government is administering this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we had some people from community radio speak to us and talk about the enormous delays with the SMA on this matter. There are 75 stations ready to go around Australia at the moment and they have been totally hamstrung by the bureaucratic procedures set up by the Department of Communications, in particular, the SMA. Basically there are three teams going around the regions of Australia holding inquiries. A management plan is then developed and licences are to be issued. This process has been going on for several years. We were told yesterday that the number of licences that have been issued out of the process was zero. I find this amazing. As the government implied, it had a priority set for holding these inquiries. If it had a priority set, when those inquiries finished in a particular region, why is it not allocating part of the spectrum via licences to people and organisations out of its management plan? This is not happening at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I challenged the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) on this two years ago he promised to look into it and said he would try to see in what way the whole procedure could be speeded up. We have discovered that it has actually slowed down. He said several years ago that there were three teams going around and the process would take, in the case of getting to Newcastle, from 1993 to 1996&mdash;three years. I said, `If you had six teams, you would be able to drop that to 18 months.' He said, `Yes, we have 12 teams and we will drop it to nine months.' He did not continue the spirit of that in reality because now we have a situation where it has blown out. Newcastle&mdash;it will not get to it in 1996&mdash;will now take to 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a whole lot of operators who are ready to go. We could understand that in a highly populated area such as the Hunter Valley there might be some spectrum crowding and that is probably a reason for delay. But we are at a bit of a loss to understand why in other areas of the country that are more remote, where in many cases there is only one applicant, why it has been so slow to issue a licence. Why is the government waiting for further competition to emerge? Surely that could be considered later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, over the last few years, there has only been a very small number of people applying for a licence and they have applied in a remote area where there is plenty of bandwidth in the spectrum, why not issue the licence? We are terribly short of small businesses to employ the youth of this country. There is a golden opportunity in allowing these community radio stations to employ people to do useful work, but the government has hamstrung that effort. They are sitting on these plans and not allowing these stations to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They sometimes issue temporary licences, which allows them to go on air for several months and then they have got to shut down. So they are in the studios, they have got everything set, they have got it operating, people are in work, they are building a listening audience, then it closes down for nine months and they have got to start again. It is a ridiculous system. The government really must look at its procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though we are complimenting the SMA for getting it right in this bill on licence fees and the way in which they are handling them, which seem a far more efficient way to go about the procedure and is a procedure that will save costs, there are other areas of the SMA's operation that leave a lot to be desired. We have raised the matter in the Senate before. There has been no action. I am getting those groups to provide me with very comprehensive information so that we can take this matter further. It is only through the proper management of things like spectrum management that we can create new work in this country and give people the opportunity to undertake that work. If we continue with the current situation, people who have the possibility of getting a job, businesses that have a chance to start up, will not have that opportunity. </PARA>

The minister's second reading speech and the explanations which went out regarding the renewal of commercial licences this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The radiofrequency spectrum has been recognised for some time as a scarce commodity. Previous radiocommunications licence fees included recovery and cost of spectrum management plus a tax to provide a return to the community for the use of that scarce commodity, but the components were not separately identified.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that there are now three categories. There is a spectrum access tax, a spectrum maintenance component and a licence issue or renewal charge. The tax component is termed the spectrum access tax and provides the community with a return or rent for the private use of a scarce commodity resource&mdash;the radiofrequency spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know how the government can justify that situation, because the commodity that is being used is the atmosphere. The atmosphere is accessed as a highway for radiocommunications. Apart from management of the spectrum by issuing licences and that sort of thing, how can it charge tax on space? I would like to have that explained to me. You have not built a highway; you have not done anything else, yet we have a tax. The parliamentary secretary who is at the table said that it is a tax and he reckons that is different from a licence. Perhaps that can be explained to me. This government does not have anything left to tax. It is probably even taxing the air that we breathe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government further justifies its situation when it comes to the financial impact. This was the explanation when we got our licence renewals: while these changes in fees may result in a fee increase or decrease for individual licensees, the total amount of revenue to the Commonwealth will be approximately the same as under the previous fee regime. I would like to know how they arrived at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to have my licence renewal due for payment on 7 October. Last year for our total commercial two-way radio licence, that is on HF, I paid between $550 and $600. This year I am renewing the licence for the same frequencies, the same bases and the same mobiles&mdash;mobiles do not have to be paid for separately if you have a base licence. I am paying for the same licence in exactly the same situation. It is a simplex situation, that is, messages are transmitted and received on the same frequency; as against a duplex situation where messages are received and transmitted on different frequencies. In other words, with my simplex system, a person can carry on a conversation like on a telephone. It cost between $550 and $600 last year. This year the cost is $1,889, and the government is saying that there is no financial impact and no change in the financial impact. Perhaps they can explain this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a rort. It is three times the previous amount, or a 300 per cent increase, if I am right.

He is also presuming that all existing licence holders in the HF spectrum will be renewing their licences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will pick one of the frequencies and split up the cost. It is split into spectrum access tax, spectrum management component and an administrative charge. The government is taxing the waves going through the air. One of these days it will tax surfers for the waves coming onto the beach. It is $327 for a commodity that has had no input from this government. It is a tax for access. The spectrum management component is $98.16. I suppose this is to justify the government's new computers. The administrative charge is $11. That is about $435 per frequency. A commercial operator of reasonable size&mdash;for instance, aerial sprayers, farmers or interstate truckers&mdash;normally has about four frequencies, and that is the case with my own licence. The cost has gone from $550-odd to $1,889. I would like an explanation for that increase because it certainly goes against what the minister had to say. I have got all the paperwork from this year and last year if anyone doubts my word. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to amateur radio. Amateur radio is quite different and has also had an increase in licence fees. There are about 20,000 amateur radio operators in Australia. Their fees have also increased, although the minister did say that the increase is now not going to be as bad. It was going to increase from $37 to $71 but, after a lot of pressure from the amateur radio operators of Australia, the minister decided to reduce it to $51. That is nearly a 40 per cent increase, anyway. I would like to know what spectrum management there is for amateur radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world is divided into three spectrums for amateur radio. We are in the Oceania section. Then you have a European section and, if I am right, the other one is regarded as the American section. Those spectrums are managed by international agreements and an international organisation. We are in the Oceania section. The government claims amateur radio has to pay more for spectrum management. I would like to have explained to me how that situation comes about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did say that amateur radio operators are vastly different from a commercial two-way HF or UHF licence. On the commercial side, and even in aviation, you license the apparatus, as it is called these days. I believe that calling it apparatus is downgrading the currency in radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of amateurs, you license the operator. Also, people have to study three aspects to get a licence: radio theory, regulations and morse code. That is what is holding me up from getting my licence at the present moment but, with a certain amount of coaching, I will get there. The difference is: with amateur radio, you are licensing the operator. How can you then increase their fees when you are not licensing the apparatus itself? That is an explanation I would like to hear in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 20,000-odd amateur radio operators in Australia are there as amateurs, exactly as the word implies. They cannot charge for their work when they work in an emergency situation. It is their hobby to talk to each other across the country&mdash;they talk about radio and anything else&mdash;but they have become very useful, as we heard in the inquiry into national disasters by the committee of which I am a member. It reported on that some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I remember rightly, the first news of Cyclone Tracy that went through Darwin in 1974 was sent by amateur radio. Amateurs are doing work for nothing. What is more, they are not allowed to charge for their services. The way the advisers are carrying on over there, they might think I do not know what I am talking about, but I do know what I am talking about. I cannot see why the government loaded these amateurs up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as it was loading up the amateur operators, the government decided to take off the licences on UHF CB and 27 meg band CB. I do not know why it decided to do that. It was only $10 a set, but I believe it was a way of providing some sort of regulation and supervision of what was going on. At least you knew who had licences. I suppose those licences could be inspected and there could be interception. I believe the conduct on the UHF CB band and on the 27 meg band has definitely deteriorated in the last couple of years, since this was taken off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Okay, the government decided to take it off. I do not know what it was collecting from those licences, but obviously it has loaded up the amateurs. It has certainly loaded up commercial radio. As I said, in my situation&mdash;which is everyone's situation&mdash;we have gone from $550 a year; the government has trebled the charge for that licence. I can tell you what is going to happen. The government will be collecting less in this situation because of rationalising of frequencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where this scarcity of spectrum is, which the government is talking about as an excuse to put up access tax, I do not know. It may certainly differ in the built-up areas, but in the remote areas there are a lot of us operating. We have very little use of a particular frequency for 24 hours a day. If we have got traffic on it for half an hour in 24 altogether, I would be surprised&mdash;for the ones I am experienced with, anyhow. Even the Flying Doctor frequency would not have an occupancy of more than 10 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join this debate on the radiocommunications bills. At the outset, I declare a personal interest. In the words of the Spectrum Management Agency, in their impersonal documents, when they send out a gouging statement each year to extract more money for a licence, I am described as a client. So I put that clearly on the record when I start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I view the Spectrum Management Agency as just a monster that has been created by this Labor government to raise more and more money from the unsuspecting, uncomplaining Australian citizen. I cannot see the purpose of it in any way at all, and my worry is that it is just going to go on growing like some cancerous growth on the Australian community, charging more and more each year from those people that it has within its claws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My particular concern, unlike Senator Panizza's, is in relation to the way the agency is now operating in the civil aviation field. I have owned and operated aircraft for 27 years, I suppose. For most of those years I never paid a cent for my radio licence. Out of the blue, I got a demand from the Spectrum Management Agency about four or five years ago to pay a licence fee, and I think most years the fee goes on increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fee, unlike Senator Panizza's, is only $45 a year but I have every expectation that, unless something is done, that will go on increasing. To me, whether it is $45 or $4.50 it is too much, because the services that I use a radio for are services that are demanded under the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's requirements. I am not speaking only on my own behalf here but probably on behalf of about 4,000 aircraft owners in Australia who do not operate under the instrument flight rules and for whom the carriage of radio is largely an elective procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason that we have to carry a radio is that there is a civil air regulation that states that if we are going to operate into controlled airspace&mdash;and that covers secondary airports such as Archerfield, Moorabbin and the rest of them&mdash;we carry a radio. But it is not mandatory from a functional point of view. It is not so many years ago, 1988, the bicentenary year, that there was a big air race around Queensland that ran for seven or 10 days. I cannot remember how many aircraft were in that, but my air race number was 137. I think there were about 150 aircraft in the race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The race was designed on daily legs. The slowest aircraft departed first and the fastest departed last. The aim was that as many aircraft as possible arrived at the same time at the end of each flying leg in the day. The race was operated strictly without radio. Pilots did a test call before they took off to make sure the radio was working and then the only other call they made in flight was when they passed over the finishing point for the leg, which was always some miles from the airport. It was just a simple call to say, `Air race 137 over the top.' The aircraft then joined the circuit and there might have been 50 or more aircraft in the circuit, which is a very confusing situation. However, that was done with absolute safety, without any incidents at all and entirely non-radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not argue that radio is not a safety aid but it is not mandatory for VFR operations. The reason that we carry a radio is that, as I said, civil air regulations require us to have one to operate in controlled airspace. It is also a safety measure. I would argue that, in those circumstances, there is no reason at all to impose a fee upon us. We have got by for all these years without having a fee imposed. We pay a levy on avgas, and avgas is considerably more expensive than motor spirit because of the taxes that this government imposes upon it. Part of that avgas levy is to cover the use of civil aviation airways facilities outside controlled airspace, where we make these radio calls. So, basically, we are paying for it that way. The other point that is quite pertinent to this is that radio is, in some way, a safety feature. If someone is prepared to have the initiative and generosity to add to their safety&mdash;they are not only dealing with their own safety, but there is a community interest element in this&mdash;I think it is quite wrong to tax them for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the business of the regulation of the spectrum itself. Senator Panizza spoke about other parts of the spectrum. I want to talk about the both civil aviation VHF&mdash;very high frequency communications, which is the common one for civil aircraft&mdash;and the high frequency band, which is only used to a very minor degree now. They operate within certain frequency bands. From memory, the VHF band for aviation is about 118 to 127.9 megahertz. That is an internationally agreed convention. It applies to all countries around the world. So there is nothing unique and there is no management involved in Australia. It is just a simple convention that that band is an aviation communications band and everyone else stays out of it. I do not see any justification at all for setting up a vast bureaucracy to manage something that does not need much managing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really worrying thing about all of this is that there is no control mechanism on the activities of the Spectrum Management Agency. I have spoken many times in the Senate on the fallacy of the user-pays doctrine. The user-pays doctrine falls down in relation to government agencies because there is no control over them. The user-pays doctrine works quite well in private enterprise where a customer goes along to a supplier or a vendor of goods and says, `I wish to buy such and such.' The vendor has control, to some degree, over the management of that service in that if the company is not managed effectively its cost of production and cost of operation goes up and they lose market share. But that never applies with a government body. A government body is never censured. In fact, if a government department runs in deficit, the secretary running it gets promoted to a higher grade and they get a bigger budget next year to cover the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you introduce a public payment component into that, the poor old unsuspecting public, which simply cannot defend itself, gets slugged with higher and higher fees. We see this every year with the Spectrum Management Agency. So it is time the government had a good hard look at what it is doing here. If it is going to charge fees for services, then it has got to have an unambiguous reason for charging those fees. Senator Panizza has demonstrated very clearly that the reason for most of these fees is extremely obscure. Also it has got to run the system efficiently. Until that happens, I am going to be a continual critic of the Spectrum Management Agency. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of changes for the fees for amateur radio operators, this is part of broader changes to apparatus licences. Under the proposal contained in the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the apparatus licence system: a new outlook</EMPHASIS>, which was released in February, the fees for apparatus licences are based on a combination of the administrative and maintenance costs of issuing a licence, and a tax component based on the value of the spectrum used. Many apparatus licence users will see fee reductions under this formula, including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, state governments and taxi services. But some fees, such as amateur fees, are to increase under the draft proposal as published. Most amateurs were paying $37 per annum but, under the formula being applied to apparatus licences in general, their annual fee would have risen by between $8 and $34 to a maximum of $71. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the implementation process for establishing a new apparatus licence regime, it had always been intended that a first round of consultation would take place before the fees were set. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Elliott) announced in March this year that the SMA had further considered the level of fees to be applied to amateurs in the light of the public benefit that amateurs provide to the community, and that a lower overall fee was then to be introduced. In view of the training and experience in communication technology that amateurs provide to young people and the role that amateurs provide in maintaining communication links at times of emergency, the SMA had decided to reduce the tax component of a licence fee to the minimum level. This reduced the fee from the proposed $71 to $51 per annum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, we are debating the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995, which the opposition supports. The purpose of this bill is twofold. One of its purposes is to make amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920 in respect of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigations, known as BASI, which is a branch of the Department of Transport, quite separate from what was known as the Civil Aviation Authority or, as it is known today, Airservices Australia or CASA, being the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the purpose of the BASI amendments is to ensure that the powers of investigations have a sound legislative basis. It allows BASI to play an enhanced role by clearly defining its functions and to ensure that the organisation's investigations of aviation accidents and incidents conform to the international civil aviation standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments include definitions of accidents and incidents. Accidents occur when a person on board an aircraft dies or is seriously injured. It also covers cases where an aircraft is missing or inaccessible or has suffered some significant damage. An incident is a near accident or an event that adversely affects the safety of the aircraft. People working in the industry and the staff of CASA and Airservices would be required to report an accident or serious incident to BASI as soon as possible. The legislation provides that there be a penalty for intentionally or recklessly failing to report an accident or serious incident. The penalty for this would be six months imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also empowers BASI investigators to enter and search premises&mdash;something which they are not entitled to do at this stage&mdash;although they would first have to obtain a search warrant from a magistrate. It would also mean that, if an Australian operated, designed or manufactured aircraft was involved in an accident overseas, the minister would be able to appoint an accredited representative to participate in the inquiry. BASI would still be able to conduct investigations into accidents overseas at the request of the country where that accident had occurred. Division 6 of the part sets out BASI's power in relation to accident sites. Curiously, the current regulations do not allow BASI staff to enter accident sites without the permission of the occupants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill would empower the investigators to enter an accident site without first obtaining permission and the investigators will be able to secure the site against unauthorised entry&mdash;a sensible provision. The wreckage of an aircraft and its contents would be taken to be in the custody of the Director of Air Safety Investigation and it would be an offence for a person to interfere with the wreckage except under certain circumstances, such as saving of lives or protecting wreckage from fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 9 would include the disclosure of air safety information by the organisation. Proposed section 19HC(8) would provide that air safety records, other than cockpit voice recordings, could not be produced in civil proceedings unless the court was satisfied the public interest in disclosing the records outweighed the adverse impacts of disclosure. It would not be possible to compel the production of air safety records, except cockpit voice recordings in a criminal case. Cockpit voice recordings would not be admissible in evidence in any civil or criminal case against a member of the aircraft's crew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been the subject of some debate over a long period and of course it is important that the cockpit recordings be used without fear by the people using them. The purpose of investigations into aircraft accidents is to determine the cause and to try to prevent accidents occurring in the future. It is generally believed that any restriction on that, or any concerns that pilots might have, might affect their willingness to speak into the voice recording mechanism. As I indicated at the beginning, the coalition supports this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the amendment to the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, this means that the authority would cease to be a statutory body in the terms of the corporations legislation. Again, this is sensible because under the corporations legislation the authority would have to be required to have an audit and prepare a business plan. As the Seafarers Rehabilitation Authority does not run a commercial business, there is nothing to audit and there is no need to prepare an annual business plan. The opposition supports both of the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cockpit recorder is there for the protection of the individual pilot, whereas the provision under clause 19CD is for the purpose of investigation of the company or the operator of the aircraft involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but surely the purpose of both the investigation of the cockpit voice recorder and the access to documentation or equipment is to detect a breach of procedures or regulations, or something like that, to determine the cause of the accident. The purpose is the same. Yet, in one case, immunity is granted to the transgressor; in the other case, there is no immunity given.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed that the act is much more restrictive about what can be done with the cockpit recorder&mdash;for example, in a court of law. BASI's purpose in investigating is not for that investigation to be used in a court of law. That apparently is the responsibility of either CASA or the Federal Police, if legal proceedings are to be initiated against the person or persons involved in the aircraft accident. BASI's role is to examine, learn and, perhaps, at some stage, change the way in which procedures should occur, rather than to be an investigative enforcer that will have some legal outcome on the individual involved in the accident.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is my understanding of it. To take that a point further: when those documents or equipment are seized by BASI and they find there have been breaches of regulations that were the reasons for the accident, does BASI maintain a confidential position with respect to that information or is it obliged to inform CASA? Does it return the documents and the equipment to the operator? What is the next step downstream from that, once BASI has made its investigation and come to a conclusion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed that, yes, BASI does write a report. It has to return the documents, if it has taken some documents, to the owner or the operator of the plane or the company. It is not unusual for BASI to be called or subpoenaed if legal proceedings are taken by the Federal Police or CAA; it can be called to give evidence. But it does not initiate a process of legal action which results in the prosecution of someone. It is not uncommon, particularly in coronial inquiries, apparently, for BASI to be asked to give its views on the matter. But it does not initiate a process as such. It has to return all documents to the person it has taken the documents from in the course of its investigations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, clause 19CN (b), at page 20, provides some more assistance in terms of the way in which a warrant is to be executed. I also understand that BASI has not had complaints laid against it. I do not know the details of the problems that have been brought to your attention about the CAA's conduct. But BASI has not had complaints in this area. The approach would be the same as it has been in the past. I do not know whether the legislation is identical, but it is very similar in the use of its words and terminology. Obviously any investigator, in an extreme circumstance, having to execute a warrant, would, I am sure, get advice about the way in which they conduct themselves in the execution of that warrant. So it is very difficult for me to define the precise circumstances of a person executing a warrant, other than to outline the sort of approach BASI has adopted in the past and, I am assured, will continue to adopt in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

Over the last six or eight months, or even back into the end of last year, the Small Business Forum, the small business community, has been asking for amendments to the Trade Practices Act in this area so that they would get a better deal.

Minister, do you agree that it is vital that any proposal for foreign interests to buy into a crucial Australian infrastructure, such as Telstra, needs to be vigorously scrutinised against proper national interest criteria? Why is the government being so tardy in responding to the all-party recommendations of the Senate foreign  ownership in the print media inquiry to reform the hopelessly inadequate Foreign Investment Review Board? Surely, if the government is serious, as you say you are, about keeping Telstra in Australian ownership, this reform is the first step. If you do not, then do you not forfeit the right to complain if or when the coalition flogs Telstra off to foreigners, the same way Aussat, Qantas, various Victorian power stations, Bankwest yesterday and probably South Australian water tomorrow have already been flogged off with your government's approval?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The role of the Foreign Investment Review Board is to scrutinise inward investment in Australia and to do it with a clear brief to apply national interest criteria to that investment. Part of that consideration, quite clearly as well, is to ensure that this enhances competitiveness and so forth within Australia and broadly by Australia in the world economy. The point here, though, is that the Foreign Investment Review Board makes that consideration, forms a recommendation, puts that recommendation to the Treasurer and the Treasurer then announces what he or she will do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this question there is a degree of speculation, I might say. The speculation starts: what if there is a coalition government and then they sell off Telstra? We do know that if there were a coalition government, they would sell off Telstra and a major part of Australian ownership in telecommunications, and our competitive advantage would move from the public sector to the private sector. It may well be that it would move into foreign hands. We know that. What I am saying is that this is speculative. The first part of the speculation is: `if there were a coalition government'. That is one good reason why there should not be a coalition government and why a lot of Australians should vote for this government&mdash;to ensure that it does not happen, to make sure that Telstra does not get privatised in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To continue with the speculation inherent in the question I am asked and therefore invited to answer, it would be a decision of a Liberal Treasurer to pass Telstra into the hands of foreign ownership after the scrutiny had been undertaken by the FIRB, however constituted.

I believe&mdash;and I have said this to the industry&mdash;that we need to see some form of continuing industry assistance, whether it be factor F or some other form, because we put a price cap on this industry in order to keep the cost of pharmaceuticals to Australian consumers low and to underpin our very competitive health system in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed without reservation to the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and sympathises very much with those who seek an advisory opinion from the ICJ designed to secure a ruling on their legality. The difficulty, however, of exacting any such opinion from the court is that we seriously doubt whether it would in practice assist the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons. In the first place, there is a very real chance that the ICJ may actually find the use of nuclear weapons legal and, in some instances, the cause of eliminating nuclear weapons would obviously not be advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very unlikely event the ICJ were to find the use of nuclear weapons illegal, in every possible and relevant way, this would contradict the stated doctrines of those nuclear weapon states and be extremely unlikely to be accepted by them. It is for this reason that Australia's earlier written submission to the ICJ on the request of the World Health Organisation for an advisory opinion on the illegality issue has argued that the court should exercise its discretion not to provide such an opinion on the substance of the question asked. It is for this reason that we made no further written submission to the ICJ in response to a request by the UN General Assembly for a similar advisory opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second part of your question: you would be aware that the government has emphatically condemned both China and France's nuclear testing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most desirable attrition rate in any defence force is 10 per cent. In economic good times they usually reach about 13 per cent and in times of recession they go down to about six per cent. We would all agree that about 10 per cent turnover is ideal. I cannot give you the actual figures relating to attrition in the navy, but I will get back to you on that.

It is quite evident from that study&mdash;I do not want to go into the details yet because I have not given it full consideration&mdash;that there will be recommendations and a changing of the way the various services do business. It is not just a matter of pay and conditions&mdash;they are always important&mdash;but it is also a matter of family dislocation, opportunities for spouse employment and a whole range of things that put pressure on whether people stay in the services.</PARA>

You can see that reflected in the rest of society. That will impact back on to the defence forces. The way that it can be most effectively resisted is through changing the way in which the job is done in many cases. Consideration will have to be given to a whole range of measures in the long term. The next decade will see a much higher concentration on development of personal skills and the retention of personnel in defence forces than the previous decade. Consideration to issues such as payment for tasks rather than according to rank will be one of the many issues that are thought of in the next few months and years, I suspect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Charitable organisations are very significant to the Australian economy and to Australian society. I do endorse the quote employed in the first part of the question. That is why, of course, the government and the Industry Commission decided to conduct an inquiry into this sector. The commission's draft report was released on 28 October last year. The draft report, when it came down, was broadly welcomed by organisations such as the Salvation Army and the Brotherhood of St Laurence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this sector was demonstrated by the Industry Commission's draft report. The commission estimated that out of the total expenditure of $4.4 billion annually, $2.5 billion is provided by governments, $1 billion from fund raising and other income, and $900 million from client fees. The draft report also highlighted the significant and diverse contributions which these organisations make in delivering community services to Australians.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Cook did not answer the question. In fact, he said, among other things, firstly, that there would be a continuation of existing policies, and, secondly, `We will, if we can, bring the budget burden down.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the first point&mdash;continuation of existing policies. I remind the Senate and the Australian community that this government, since Mr Keating has been Prime Minister&mdash;let us go back only in that period&mdash;has increased the taxation burden very substantially on the Australian community. For the financial year 1992-93, which is the first full year of Mr Keating's reign, the total burden taken from the community by taxation and other charges by the Commonwealth government was $95 billion. This current financial year, it is $125 billion, an increase of $30 billion, or over 30 per cent, over a four-year period. The CPI adjustment over that period is something less than $12 billion. So there has been a huge increase in taxation and charges on the Australian community over that short period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not all. In the financial year at the start of Mr Keating's reign, the debt by the Commonwealth was $30 billion. It is estimated that at the end of this current financial year it will be virtually $100 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that was asked of Senator Cook today was: can the minister confirm to Australian families that ALP policy for the next election will be to guarantee no new taxes or increases in existing taxes in the following three years? The relevancy of that question is very important, given this government's record, as my colleague Senator Gibson has just enunciated, since Paul Keating took over as Prime Minister. The day he became Prime Minister he made three pledges. The second pledge was to deal honestly with the people and tell them the truth. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much as is humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with them, to them, and realistically . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The heart of this question goes to that honesty. Since the 1993 federal election, Mr Keating has jacked up taxes by more than $3 billion a year. We have higher taxation of unused long service leave and annual leave lump sum payments; an increased tax on credit unions; increases in fringe benefits tax; increases in the general rate of wholesale sales tax, which is up two per cent right across the board, on everything; extra sales tax on wine and cider; an increase in petrol excise, which is up 7c a litre for leaded petrol and 5c a litre for unleaded petrol; an increase in tobacco excise; an increase in departure tax; an increase in sales tax on cars; an increase in company tax; and an increase in Medicare tax, otherwise known as the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are quite legitimately asking this government to come clean, in advance of the next election, as to whether they are going to increase existing taxes and introduce any new taxes. They went to the last election, the 1993 election, promising no increases in existing taxes and promising no new taxes. All of those lies have now come to fruition. All of those promises have been broken. Not only have those promises been broken but the much heralded l-a-w tax cuts were jettisoned within a matter of weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until this government starts to come clean and say whether or not they are going to have a policy on tax this time and detail the taxes they are going to increase, one can only quite rightly presume from their record that they are going to continue in the way they have done in the last 12 years; that is, steadily increase taxes. You cannot have over $3 billion worth of tax increases in but two years, since the last election, and then come in here and try and hoodwink the people of Australia into believing that they are not going to be suffering further tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one per cent tax increase across the board as of 1 July meant that every single solitary product that is sold in Australia went up, including things like fruit, vegetables and meat, which this mob claim are not taxed. The fact of the matter is that every section of input taxes went up thanks to this government's increase of two per cent in the last year and one per cent in July of this year. That is on, as I say, fruit, vegetables, meat, confectionery, washing powder, detergents, soap, personal hygiene products, fruit juices and pet food. And the list goes on and on and on. Most people do not realise they are now paying 22 per cent sales tax on things like toothpaste, recycled paper products, toilet paper, umbrellas and all of those sorts of things that they were told prior to the last election were not taxed by this Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the government has simply not told the truth prior to the last number of elections, in particular prior to the 1993 election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Treasurer (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise because there was an implication&mdash;in fact, if memory serves me it was an outright allegation&mdash;on the part of Senator Short that there was a connection between the foreign debt of this country and home mortgage interest rates. That is absolutely, completely and utterly untrue. I will argue that anywhere in this country in front of any audience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason is perfectly simple. There are two categories of interest rates. There are short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates. That fact is known by any 20-year-old money market dealer on any dealing desk anywhere in this country. The home mortgage rate is driven by short-term interest rates, and the long-term interest rates are the ones affected by the overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two consequences for this untruth, which I believe is being peddled deliberately by those senators opposite. Either they do not know the distinction, in which case they should be nowhere near the treasury bench in this country, or they do know the distinction and they are deliberately seeking to deceive people and frighten them about the future of their home mortgage rates and, might I also say, seeking to frighten people who are in small business who are dependent on the short-term money market through 90-day bills to finance their business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at what this government has done, you will see that it has an exemplary record as far as short-term interest rates in this country are concerned because it has brought down inflation. That is what makes a difference to the home mortgage rate. Since the home mortgage rate was deregulated by this government as part of its deregulation of the financial markets, the home mortgage interest rate has been determined by the cash rate plus a margin. Senator Short knows that. Senator Short must know that because he has a career as an economist. Any economist could tell the Senate that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the cash rate, you will see that it is driven by the inflation rate. That is why it is as low as it is today. If you look at long-term interest rates, you will see that the Commonwealth government does not borrow overseas on the long-term bond market. It has not done so for eight years. The total outstanding debt in terms of Commonwealth government bonds is only five per cent of the foreign debt. All of these facts are known perfectly well by senators opposite. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that Labor is to blame. There is a direct connection between Labor's budget deficits and Australia's foreign debt. The real story has been told by Dr Vince FitzGerald in his report. In a speech last year, he emphasised that even more. In terms of foreign borrowing, at the end of June 1995, 46 per cent of Australia's gross foreign debt had been issued by the public sector. True, most of that is state debt; but it is debt incurred because of the federal government's policies in relation to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far more importantly, the Commonwealth's massive borrowing within Australia to fund its budget deficits has crowded out private sector borrowers and forced them to go overseas to secure loan funds. It is that pressure on the private market that is forcing people to go overseas. It does not matter whether it is the private or public sector going overseas to borrow. The fact is that the government, through its budget deficit policy, has put such pressure on the domestic markets that interest rates inevitably go up, home mortgage rates get hit, as does every other interest rate in Australia, and it costs every Australian dearly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Deputy President. As I said, we have to look at this whole process&mdash;whether it relates to interest rates, which ultimately have some impact on the people of this country. That is what we are really talking about. You can try to draw some parallel in terms of the question, but the reality is that the purpose of your question is designed to get a message out to the Australian public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to compare the records. We do not know what your policies are for the future because you will not come out and tell anybody, so we have to go back to the past. A long time ago it may have been, but the reality is that under you in government last time round the people went backwards. Under us, disposable household income&mdash;despite all of your claims about taxes&mdash;has increased by almost 20 per cent. It did not do that when you were last in government; people went backwards. </PARA>

We have brought about the lowest level of industrial disputation since 1942 when the records were first kept. That is what the people want to hear about. What is important is that we have been looking after the Australian public by implementing policies that have seen significant job growth that you could never even dream of. The inflation rate during the period that you were in government under Howard was 9.8 per cent. You could not even get it below seven per cent, and you talk about economic management. In terms of interest rates, which are so important to you, Senator Short, the underlying inflation rate when Howard left office was 10.5 per cent. What is it now? Substantially lower. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not deal with what Senator Murphy said because it had nothing to do with the issue. He was deliberately avoiding the issue. What concerns me is that a man for whom I did have some respect, Senator Wheelwright, has participated in what strikes me as being one of the most disgraceful attempts by this government to cover up its incompetence. Poor Australians, particularly young families, are having rising interest rates forced upon them as a result of not only government incompetence but also government malevolence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to remind Senator Wheelwright of a few things. A year ago, the bank housing rate was 8.75 per cent; it is now 10.5 per cent. That is a 20 per cent increase in the rate; it is a one-fifth increase in the rate. I suppose it is just bad luck that our balance of payments happens to have blown out and that other rates in the marketplace have had that sort of effect. We have had a double lie. The first lie is that the foreign debt has had no impact at all on interest rates, and I will demonstrate that to be a lie. The second lie is that it was all due to the private sector anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Detailed statistics put out by the Parliamentary Research Service show that public sector debt is $101 billion and net foreign debt is $180 billion. Some 60 per cent of Australia's net foreign debt is due directly to the public sector. Senator Wheelwright is going to say, `But that's all the states.' Those state borrowings are agreed at Commonwealth Loan Council meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all part of the great economic plan by the world's greatest Treasurer. What has happened is that this nation has gone massively and hopelessly into debt. One of the reasons it has gone hopelessly into debt is that we are not exporting enough compared with the amount that we import. Another major reason is that we are not saving enough. If any Australian business person&mdash;remember, they account for only 40 per cent of the foreign debt&mdash;wants to borrow money, where do they borrow it from? They cannot borrow it in Australia because there is not enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have got to go offshore. There are not enough savings in Australia as a direct result of this government's incompetent policies. Let us see what happens. Not only is this government running the economy down, as it did with the worst recession we have had&mdash;the recession we had to have&mdash;but also it cannot run its own matters. It goes into the marketplace and chases the scarce resources with its massive deficits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not only is the government ruining the economy; it is also going into the marketplace with an $11 billion deficit. Where does the money come from? It has to borrow that money. It goes into the market, doesn't it, Senator Wheelwright, to borrow that money? Are you going to tell me that no foreigner invests in those Commonwealth securities? Of course not. It is phoney, and Senator Wheelwright knows it is phoney, for him to pretend that the marketplace for money is not influenced in any way by our massive deficit or by this government's incompetent management of the economy or by the positive and determined disincentives that this government has for savings in Australia by taxing the hell out of anyone who is foolish enough to save in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that this government's policies have led to this disaster and this blow-out in the foreign account. Senator Wheelwright knows it perfectly well. He knows it is only because of a failure of Australia to participate fully and properly, as it could under decent management, in the world marketplace that we are going broke at the rate of between $2 billion and $3 billion a month. That means that people overseas are less willing to lend money to us to survive unless we pay a higher interest rate, and that higher interest rate pervades itself throughout the society. As I said, there has been a 20 per cent increase in the housing rate that Senator Wheelwright quite improperly sought to distinguish from the marketplace as a whole. What we have heard from Senator Wheelwright demeans him. It is disgraceful that a man of his background, who has been in the marketplaces, should convey this nonsense. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

One of the confusions in this debate is that the Liberal Party and their spokesmen have shifted constantly between interest rates and mortgage rates and tried to transpose government comments accordingly and then say that there is a contradiction where, in fact, what they have done&mdash;I think through incompetence, not through maliciousness&mdash;is confused the two.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9 November 1994 the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, Senator Dominic Foreman, tabled the Report on the Inquiry into the 1993 Federal Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1 </EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. Under existing administrative arrangements all candidates are advised in writing of times and places of mobile polling in institutions at least one week before the commencement of mobile polling. The State Branches of the major political parties will be advised as well. However, it should be noted that mobile polling often requires last minute rescheduling within 48 hours of polling day due to local circumstances. For these reasons notification should remain an administrative arrangement and not be made mandatory by law.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all patients in institutions be advised of their right to cast a postal vote if they are unable to vote at a mobile polling booth. The AEC should provide advisory forms for distribution in the institutions to assist in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. Hospital and institutional administrations are already supplied during the election period with postal voting materials where mobile polling facilities exist.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That standing instructions for AEC officers be amended to make clear that all patients in hospitals and nursing homes are to be presumed able to exercise their right to vote, unless the responsible AEC officer is satisfied on medical grounds that a patient is too incapacitated to cast a vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. However, the decision of the responsible AEC officer should only be made on the advice of a medical practitioner or a responsible member of the medical staff of the hospital.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the AEC improve education for hospital and nursing home administration staff to ensure that patients are not deprived of the right to vote, and that the rights of party scrutineers are understood and applied consistently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. The AEC will arrange for information to be made available to party scrutineers and to hospital and nursing home administrations for distribution to staff members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That section 234 of the Electoral Act be amended to require that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">every elector voting at a mobile polling booth be informed of his or her right to be assisted in casting a vote. Where the elector requests assistance, the officer in charge of the booth shall identify the AEC officers and any scrutineers present, and inform the elector of his or her right to choose any one or none of those present to assist; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">require that unless the elector's medical condition necessitates the presence of medical staff, only the elector, an AEC officer and a scrutineer nominated by a candidate in the election may be present at the filling out of the ballot paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in part. While the recommendation to advise every elector voting at mobile booths of their right to assistance is supported, it is essential that the right of the elector to nominate whoever they wish to assist them in casting their vote be retained. Existing administrative arrangements already require polling officials to advise voters of their right to assistance. However, the recommendation appears to seek to prevent the voter from nominating a friend or relative or a hospital staff member to assist them. This would constitute an unnecessary reduction in the current rights of the assisted voter and may cause distress to the aged and frail. The recommendation also appears to seek to allow all polling officials and scrutineers to observe the marking of ballot papers in all cases. This would infringe the secrecy of the ballot. Finally, the recommendation that polling officials and scrutineers should be formally identified to each voter is already catered for by provisions of the Act which require all polling officials and scrutineers to wear identification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 6 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That subsection 226(5)(a) of the Electoral Act be amended to provide that subsection 340(1) (relating to canvassing near polling places) applies to a hospital that is a polling place, or a special hospital within the meaning of section 225, once such a hospital is actually in use as a polling place rather than from the issue of the writ.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in part. For special hospitals, within the meaning of section 225, canvassing should not be permitted on any of the five days prior to and including polling day when mobile polling may take place. Without a definite cut off there is the possibility of disputes between mobile polling staff and canvassers, especially when last minute changes to mobile visiting times have been made necessary. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill currently before Parliament disallows canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on polling day and in special hospitals during the five days before and including polling day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That subsection 225(1) of the Electoral Act be amended so that special hospitals can be gazetted at any time.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill currently before Parliament makes provision for this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That subsection 227(4) of the Electoral Act be amended to delete the requirement for the AEC to gazette the details of visits to remote communities by mobile polling teams, and to insert a requirement that the AEC give maximum public notice of the places, dates and times of such visits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. While gazettal of the place to be visited would continue, gazettal of other details is unnecessary and does not assist public information. Public notices lodged in other mediums, such as local newspapers, would more readily come to the attention of electors and allow the AEC more flexibility in scheduling mobile polling visits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 9 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That subsection 222(2) of the Electoral Act be amended to restrict the right to vote, at a hospital which is declared a polling place, to an elector who is attending the hospital on polling day as a patient or visitor of a patient or an employee in the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. Implementation of this recommendation would disadvantage the public in their not being able to vote in places which are essentially public places. Polling booths in hospitals are established on the approval of the hospital administration and in such a location as to not inconvenience the day to day operation of the hospital. They operate as any other polling place on polling day, except that mobile teams also operate in the hospital wards. Should such a convenient location not be available in the hospital, a polling booth is not established on polling day. Instead, the hospital is declared as a special hospital and only mobile polling is undertaken. The implementation of this recommendation would create a practical problem of enforcement, effectively requiring the polling officials to interrogate voters as to their eligibility in an environment where such officiousness would not be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 10 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the AEC, in consultation with the political parties, review procedures to ensure that access to polling booths in remote and isolated areas is equally available to scrutineers for all candidates contesting an election in a Division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. Administrative arrangements already require the AEC to advise candidates of remote mobile polling schedules and to carry how-to-vote cards where scrutineers are unable to reach all remote locations. This is the extent of the involvement the AEC should have in the canvassing activities of the candidates and political parties. The AEC should not be responsible for directly providing or in other ways ensuring that scrutineers have access to remote mobile locations, by for example providing transport. This should remain the responsibility of the political parties and candidates. The provision of transport facilities to remote polling places for the scrutineers of all candidates would not be economically feasible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 11 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the AEC minimise the use of dual booths at the next federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. While the use of dual booths increases the number of ordinary votes to be counted and speeds the result in an election, the AEC recognises the difficulties experienced by participants in the voting process resulting from dual polling booths. Accordingly, the AEC will actively review these and other polling places with a view to their rationalisation. Where population research indicates voter convenience and operational efficiency will be enhanced by the provision of dual booths, ways of providing for better signposting, better separation of voters, and better education will be investigated to minimise any identifiable local difficulties. It is noted that the Committee appears to be inconsistent in commending the use of multiple booths in metropolitan locations but not dual booths on Divisional boundaries.</PARA>

The use of existing dual polling booths and the creation of new ones are decided well in advance of the election period on the basis of population research and administrative guidelines with the aim of enhancing voter convenience and operational efficiency, and before all parties contesting an election are known.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. The implementation of this recommendation will not eliminate late enrolments and the disadvantages of hindrance to the election preparations and the increased administrative overheads will outweigh any additional convenience to the public.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in principle. The Government accepts the point made by the Committee that there is a need to further clarify citizenship requirements for candidates notwithstanding the Sykes v Cleary case. Based on the High Court judgement in that case there must be some doubt as to whether the measure suggested by the Committee of introducing into the Citizenship Oath a renunciation of foreign allegiance would be effective. The Government does agree however, that the issue of citizenship requirements should be considered by relevant Ministers before the next election and will be referred for that purpose to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 37 </EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. Such a requirement would disadvantage independent candidates without a large organised party structure, and particularly independent Senate candidates in the smaller States and the Territories. From a practical point of view such a requirement would place an unsupportable burden on AEC staff in having to do enrolment checks on all signatories, especially where nominations are lodged close to the close of nominations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That subsection 167(3) and sections 177 and 180 of the Electoral Act be amended so that the whole of a political party's bulk nomination of House of Representatives candidates is not invalidated by a) the death or withdrawal of a candidate within that bulk nomination or b) a bulk-nominated candidate also nominating separately.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in part. A bulk nomination should not be invalidated by the death or withdrawal of a candidate or by a bulk-nominated candidate nominating separately.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported. This would be administratively more convenient for the AEC and it is standard government accounting practice to refund any moneys paid to the Australian Government back to the original payee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 41 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That section 167 of the Electoral Act be amended so that a national officer of a registered political party can make a "bulk nomination" of that party's endorsed House of Representatives candidates. If necessary, a national nomination should be able to override a State nomination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in principle. In making recommendation 41, the Committee appears to have proceeded on a misunderstanding of the present position and consequently there is no need to amend the Act to achieve the first part of the recommendation. The current legislation allows the registered officer of a nationally registered party to nominate House of Representatives candidates in any State or Division, provided the nomination is to the Australian Electoral Officer, if made in bulk for the whole of the State/Territory, or to the Divisional Returning Officer, if made for an individual Division. The second part of the recommendation is supported in principle. It is important that the AEC not be involved in what could essentially be a difficulty between the national and State administrations of a political party. In situations where there is a bulk nomination from both the registered officer of the nationally registered party and the registered officer of the registered State branch of the same party, unless there is a written (lodged with the AEC) agreement between the State and national registered officers as to which nomination are to remain in force, the State nominations are to take precedence and the others rejected. A similar arrangement should take place where bulk nominations are made by the registered officers of the "home" State and another State, whereby the nominations of the "home" State registered officer would take precedence, unless there is some agreement in place.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 42 </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That sections 156, 175 and 176 of the Electoral Act be amended, so that the minimum period from the date of the writ to the close of nominations is reduced to five days (that is, a nominations period of not less than five days nor more than 28 days) with the hour of nomination to be 12 noon and nominations to be declared at 5pm on the same day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. With a minimum nomination period of 5 days, nominations would close before the close of rolls. The close of rolls must be before the close of nominations because the enrolment of nominators must be checked. The recommendation could also lead to a close of rolls being very close to close of nominations which would be administratively unsupportable. A 24 hour period between close of nominations and declaration of nominations would be more useful. Overall any reduction in the period from the issue of the writ to the close of nominations would cut drastically into election preparation time.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. The recommendation would impose considerable administrative burdens on Divisional office staff during the already busy election period. The AEC does not make lists of who apply for a postal vote, but merely places the applications in an order to facilitate checking signatures against those on the certificate envelopes during the scrutiny. The number of postal vote applications received in Divisional offices ranges from about 700 to over 3,500 at each election. Further, electors are entitled to apply for a postal vote without that information being supplied by the AEC to political parties who may then single the elector out for canvassing purposes. This may discourage some electors from voting at all, and would certainly give rise to complaints such as from electors who are absent from their homes. Political parties have the right to examine postal vote applications after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 46 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That subsection 189(3) of the Electoral Act be amended to provide that all information (excluding the elector's name) on postal vote applications from silent enrolment electors be deleted or obliterated before public inspection.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in principle. However, all registered postal voters should be sent ballot papers directly without the need for an application. This would bring the AEC in line with many of the States and reduce voter confusion. There is no justification provided for the arbitrary 100km limit and it fails to take account of the real problem. The test for whether a General Postal Voter should be sent ballot papers direct is not one of distance, but one of the difficulty and unreliability of mail deliveries. For example, there is an island off Tasmania which is only about 20 kms from the nearest polling booth, but which only receives weekly mail deliveries. In the Northern Territory, with approximately 200 mobile polling places and 40 static polling places, almost every elector would be ineligible under the 100 km rule, yet in some remote areas mail deliveries are weekly at best.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. The AEC currently provides facilities for interstate voters on polling day in locations where it has been established that a need exists. These facilities are reviewed between each election. For example, facilities are located at resort towns and cities (both close to borders and elsewhere), cross-border locations, interstate highway border towns and many other locations. For the 1993 election there were 182 centres providing facilities for interstate voting on polling day, in addition to the 147 Divisional offices. Whilst there may be a gain in service to some electors in remote localities, this would be counter-balanced by administrative complications and increased costs. The recommendation would introduce interstate absent voting for two entire States at certain remote polling places. For example, the Division of Grey would not only have to provide for and issue ballots for all other South Australian Divisions, but also for Kalgoorlie WA, Northern Territory, Maranoa Qld, Farrer and Parkes NSW, a total of 5 extra Divisions and all the material this implies, for perhaps a handful of voters. Advertising and public information campaigns by the AEC would be complex and expensive. The AEC would effectively have to mount separate information campaigns aimed at just residents in the affected Divisions. Finally, this recommendation appears to run counter to the intention behind recommendation 11 for the minimisation of dual polling booths.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Supported. The Government acknowledges the interest of the Committee in the possible effect of restructuring on the efficiency of electoral services, and notes that the Committee has been supportive in the past of some change to the current field structure. While the Government would expect the AEC to consult widely with all interested parties before taking decisions on major structural change, it does not consider that proposals for such change should be referred to the Committee for inquiry and report.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported. No clear arguments have been advanced as to why this is desirable. A reduction in the election timetable will place increasing pressure on the administrative efficiency of the AEC and has the potential to jeopardise security and accuracy. There must be enough time for the production and the distribution of ballot papers to overseas and interstate postal voters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In taking note of the government's response to the report of the parliamentary committee which I chair, I want to take the opportunity to respond in part to the debate that is occurring in the community concerning the native title legislation&mdash;in particular, calls for the legislation to be amended. Those calls have come from stakeholders on many sides of the issue. They have been accompanied by suggestions that the legislation is not working and that major amendment to the legislation is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is still very much in its early days. The parliament, in framing this legislation, put in place an automatic review of the legislation to occur after two years of its operation. The Joint Committee on Native Title will undertake that role in due course, towards the end of this year and early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at international experience in relation to native title legislation, it is quite clear that our native title legislation will evolve over time and that the developments will be shaped by judicial decisions and the development of our experience. It is also important to note that the Western Australian government's High Court challenge to the legislation effectively delayed the implementation of the act by up to 18 months because all parties to native title matters tended to hold off, awaiting the result of that High Court challenge. There are also key court cases pending that go to issues of pastoral leases and other difficult issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that it is still early days. There have been a number of matters which have delayed the proper development and experience of the legislation. When we consider any changes to the legislation, we ought to bear that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two key points I wanted to make in addressing this government response. Firstly, amendments to the Native Title Act are not, in my view, the major issue. I think the act correctly established a balance of interests. I think the challenge for Australian society and all the interest groups is to build constructive relationships, processes and protocols that allow the legislation to be given proper effect. To seek major amendment to the legislation misunderstands the challenge confronting us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very real issues that need to be resolved but they do not, in my view, go to the detail of the legislation. They go to Australian society and the key interest groups building their relationships, building the processes and the protocols which will allow them to implement the legislation passed by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who advocate amendment to the legislation miss that key point. Sure, we will have to consider amendments to the legislation if experience proves that certain aspects of it are not working. But I really think the key to it is to come to terms with the issues represented by the native title legislation and for the parties to work through the change in relationships that are required as a result of that legislation&mdash;the fact that Aboriginal people now have native title rights and how others must respond to those rights and make sure that they are able to be enjoyed by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I do not think it is a question of amendments to the legislation so much as a question of coming to terms with native title, building relationships and processes that allow other stakeholders and interests to interact with native title holders, enjoy their respective rights and pursue their respective interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I wish to make is that state governments have a decisive role to play in making this legislation work. There has been a very strong concentration on the issue of states passing complying legislation. That, obviously, is an important matter, but that is not where the role of the states ends, nor is it where their influence ends. The states are integral to the successful workings of the act. Quite frankly, if the states do not take a pro-active and positive role, then the success of the legislation will be seriously impeded and we will not get the sorts of results that we all hope for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments have to use the opportunities provided for in the Native Title Act. There is a range of opportunities for state governments to utilise the act, to adapt its processes for themselves and to take account of local state factors. They have a crucial role in helping build relationships between the stakeholders within their own states. They obviously are key players in terms of land and mining legislation, so they have an important role to play in building those relationships. I think they really have to seriously look at the other state laws that exist in their states to make sure that they can redesign those state laws into a regime that coexists with the native title legislation rather than works against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for all those reasons the state governments have an important role to play. At this stage I would like to congratulate the South Australian government, which I think has been the most pro-active in this regard and is at least taking a positive approach to the legislation. It really does contrast quite starkly with my own state government, the Western Australian Liberal government, which has at every turn attempted to block the implementation of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They passed their own legislation which sought to abolish native title rights. They took the High Court challenge, which they lost seven-nil. They have taken a range of other court challenges which have sought to frustrate and overturn the procedures of the Native Title Tribunal. They have consistently run a scare campaign. It is a regular feature for the Premier of WA, Mr Court, to do a weekend press release where he complains about the effect on mining et cetera of native title claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, none of these scare tactics is supported by the statistics. Although I do not have time today, I am happy to make available to any senator the statistics that establish that mining exploration activity in Western Australia has increased by 20 per cent. There is no support, including in the Western Australian Government's own budget papers, for the assertion that mining is being held back by the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the state government has used the section 29 future act regime of the legislation to attempt to clog up the Native Title Tribunal and frustrate its objectives. An example of that is that it has processed all mining exploration and other applications through the Native Title Tribunal and has applied on all occasions for those procedures to be expedited. As a result, we have the tribunal swamped with applications in Western Australia. But it is interesting to note that only 73 per cent of those processed so far have been opposed and that the vast majority of applications are proceeding through the tribunal without any impediment brought about by native title claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I would like to point out is that, of the 1,014 future act notices, 711 related to prospecting and exploration licences and only 288 related to mining leases. What is worth noting there is that not all of those would have needed to be processed through the Native Title Tribunal. I think only about 10 such applications have been made in the rest of Australia. Despite the fact that we are the major mining state, it is clearly an attempt by the Western Australian government to clog up the tribunal's processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government has not taken up the opportunity provided in the legislation to seek to exclude some exploration activity from the right to negotiate regime, which would have taken a lot of the pressure off the system and possibly allowed exploration to occur without triggering the right to negotiate regime. It has made no attempts to incorporate the native title legislation and make it concurrent with mining and land legislation requirements to make the system work more effectively for miners. It has, in fact, made everything consequential rather than concurrent, which would facilitate quicker processing of mining applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the state government has deliberately sought to discourage progress between developers and Aboriginals. In Broome, where substantial progress has been made between the Rubibi Aboriginal group and the local Broome council, it is common knowledge that the Premier, Richard Court, has actively dissuaded developers from proceeding in the Broome area. He is alleged to have abused and threatened the management of Paspaley Pearling over a deal they did with the local Aboriginal people. He is alleged to have warned Mr Travelodge, who is now the owner of the Broome Cable Beach Club, not to seek to progress developments of his interests there for a couple of years until this matter is resolved. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its Inquiry, the committee will produce further reports addressing the balance of its Terms of Reference. This first report is primarily focused on the committee's term of reference relating to "the need for journalists to protect the identity of their sources of information!'. However, it was found by the committee in preparing the report that the issue of shield laws for journalists could not be adequately dealt with without some consideration of term of reference (e), journalist ethics. The report also raises issues concerning other terms of reference such as (d) relating to courts and tribunals and the media and (f) relating to disciplinary processes for journalists. These terms of reference will be more fully addressed by the Committee in subsequent reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering the report, it has become clear that the report raises issues concerning other aspects of the Committee's terms of reference apart from journalists' privilege.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am responding on behalf of the Government to the Report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on Rural Adjustment, Rural Debt and Rural Reconstruction which was tabled on 6 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, let me congratulate the Committee for the thorough approach it took in addressing the terms of reference and for presenting what I consider to be a well-balanced report. I note from the Report that the Committee received 290 submissions, held 17 public hearings and took evidence from 262 witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased that the Committee supports the policy settings of the current Scheme (RAS `92), particularly the three-pronged objectives of farm productivity, profitability and sustainability. The Committee has also endorsed the significant shift in focus from the assistance measures provided under the RAS `88 to the central thrust of the RAS `92 arrangements which reorients the Scheme towards improved farm productivity, profitability and sustainability, or farm exit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the thrust of the Committee's report and recognises the Committee's concerns about aspects of administration and management of the Scheme. The Government has a program of measures in place to more effectively deliver the program to the target groups and monitor the performance of the Scheme against its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of the Committee's recommendations have already been implemented or are under active consideration outside of any Government response to the Committee's report. In the context of the Government's response to the drought, an enhanced Farm Management Bond scheme, removing the linkage between re-establishment grants and Job Search Allowance and new funding for a regional adjustment approach have already been implemented. The issues surrounding re-establishment, training, exceptional circumstances support, farm business plans, orderly exit, young farmers and appeal mechanisms, raised in the Report, have been under active consideration in the context of a review of the RAS guidelines which commenced in July 1994. A revised set of RAS guidelines are scheduled to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">be completed soon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report identified several major policy issues which require further consideration. These include whether interest rate subsidies are an effective instrument to facilitate structural adjustment, whether the principal mechanism to deliver outcomes should become skills enhancement rather than productivity enhancement, and the removal of exceptional circumstances provisions from the RAS and their inclusion in a separate Commonwealth-State agreement. These issues will be further considered by the Government, including as part of an evaluation of the RAS scheduled to commence early next year and to be completed by 31 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A schedule outlining the Government's response to all recommendations and providing comment on the major conclusions and recommendations contained in the Report is attached.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion 1: Adequacy of the RAS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.76 On the basis of the evidence presented to the inquiry, the Committee considers that in the short to medium term, several aspects of the Rural Adjustment Scheme must be improved and changed. The Committee is of the view that there is considerable confusion in the rural community about the focus and objectives of RAS 92. This confusion is so widespread that the Committee considers that, if accepted by the government, the recommendations in this report should be implemented as a revamped program with a new name. This program should focus on farm productivity, profitability and sustainability with a principal component being skills enhancement, professional advice and financial management, as well as the re-establishment grant. The Committee is of the view that exceptional circumstances should be removed from rural adjustment and made the subject of a separate Commonwealth-State agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the Committee's support for the RAS 92 objectives and notes its concerns regarding confusion in the community about the focus and objectives of the Scheme. The Government has decided that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, in conjunction with State and Territory RAS authorities, will develop a communications strategy to address this problem for implementation during 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will further consider the name of the program and the mix of instruments for achieving its objectives during the evaluation of the Scheme scheduled for 1996. The Government considers that action prior to this time would be premature due to the recent introduction of the Scheme and the limited information, therefore, on its performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion 2: Guidelines</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.32 The Committee recognises that in relation to Commonwealth-State agreements a fine balance needs to be drawn between guidance or direction and the need for administrative flexibility in the delivery of programs arising from Commonwealth-State agreements. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that it is essential that the Commonwealth Government promote a more consistent and uniform approach to the implementation of rural adjustment measures. To achieve this objective, the Committee is of the view that guidelines should be more prescriptive to avoid ambiguities and anomalies in interpretation and results. This in tum will mean that potential recipients of RAS will have a clearer understanding of their eligibility for and entitlements to RAS programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted&mdash;action already in train</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following comments from various interests, including from recipients of RAS support, and a recognition of inconsistencies in the treatment by States in their interpretation and application of the RAS guidelines, a review of the guidelines was initiated by the Commonwealth Government in July 1994. A Commonwealth and State working party to examine the consistent application and interpretation of the guidelines was established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultations with the States on new guidelines are continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.33 The Committee welcomes advice from the department that it is preparing a manual of accounting and administrative procedures for use by the Commonwealth and States to ensure consistency but is disappointed that this manual was not prepared earlier. The Committee, however, is not convinced that this measure alone will solve inherent problems with the formulation and implementation of guidelines. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, in some instances, guidelines should include a memorandum of understanding on the scope and application of the measures agreed to between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. The Committee considers that the memorandum of understanding need not be a legalistic document but should contain clear definitions of purpose, scope or application of adjustment measures.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.89 The Committee is convinced that sound financial and management skills are the key to a robust, competitive, profitable and flexible farm sector. Accordingly the Committee recommends that, in the medium to long term, skills enhancement, including education, training and access to professional advice, should become the principal component of the Rural Adjustment Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further Consideration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for greater emphasis on assisting farmers to improve their technical, financial and risk management skills was identified as part of the new policy direction for the RAS announced in the context of the 1994 Budget. The Government accepts that there may be further opportunities to give effect to this objective. Indeed, legislative amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 to facilitate group training received the Royal Assent on 12 April 1995. The Committee's recommendation will be reviewed and further developed in consultation with stakeholders. Review of this issue will also take place in the context of the 1996 RAS evaluation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion 8: Re-establishment grant and JSA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.102 The Committee considers that regulations stipulating that a farmer or spouse who remains on JSA for longer that 9 months is excluded form the $45000 re-establishment grant cannot be justified on the ground of basic rights to access government programs.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion 11: Exceptional circumstances</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.131 The Committee considers that the Commonwealth government has a responsibility to provide additional assistance in times of exceptional circumstances, as it is in the national interest to protect and maintain Australia's agricultural base and productivity capacity, including the breeding stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government currently provides additional farm business support under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the RAS. For example, in the context of the current exceptional circumstances drought in parts of Australia, almost 4600 farm businesses had received (up to the end of June 1995) farm business support through the drought exceptional circumstances provisions of the RAS, at a total cost of more than $65.0 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.132 The Committee considers that the Commonwealth government should define exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exceptional circumstances support is already defined as support to farm businesses viable in the long term but facing short term difficulties due to events which could not reasonably be expected to be incorporated into normal risk management strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is prepared to consider submissions for exceptional circumstances support on a case by case basis. It would be difficult to provide precise definitions of all possible exceptional circumstances events, although in the case of exceptional circumstances drought, the Commonwealth and State Governments, through the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ), have recognised the importance of developing a more precise definition of exceptional drought. ARMCANZ Ministers have agreed on a process for considering drought exceptional circumstances based on six core criteria: meteorological conditions, agronomic and stock conditions, water supplies, environmental impacts, farm income levels and scale of the event. Work is continuing through the On-Farm Risk Management Working Group of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management to further develop a framework which includes drought criteria, indicators, attributes and benchmarks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's approach to drought exceptional circumstances support for farm businesses is based on the National Drought Policy and its principles of sustainable development, effective risk management, productivity growth and structural adjustment in the farm sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RAS exceptional circumstances support and rural counselling positions, the drought relief payment and Austudy are being monitored by the Departments of Primary Industry and Energy, Social Security and Employment, Education and Training respectively. A Post Implementation Review of the drought relief payment by the Department of Social Security is currently scheduled to commence in October 1995. The review forms part of the Department's ongoing review process. Other elements of the drought relief package canvassed in the Report (eg investment allowance for farm storage and water facilities) were introduced in March 1995. The effectiveness of assistance provided by the overall package will be evaluated after termination of the drought exceptional circumstances event. In the meantime monitoring of performance is being conducted by means of State reports in an agreed standard format and through State input of data on exceptional circumstances applications and funding to the MIS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Employment, Education and Training will also monitor the effectiveness of labour market programs used by farmers in drought exceptional circumstances areas.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.168 The Committee received consistent evidence that the farm household support program is "a total failure" because of ill-defined guidelines, inadequate training for DSS staff and poor communication.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further consideration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comprehensive operating guidelines for the Farm Household Support Scheme were issued to Department of Social Security staff before implementation of the program. These guidelines are maintained as part of the Department's overall administrative guidelines. A training package was developed and delivered in regional offices. A National Help Desk was established and has been in operation for the entire duration of the scheme. The low take up rate of the Scheme may account for the lack of experience of some staff in dealing with claims for Farm Household Support, in that the numbers on the scheme are small and spread nationally. Therefore, officers would have few dealings with farmers claiming Farm Household Support at a given time. Information packages were produced and widely distributed several weeks prior to implementation of the Scheme. Information leaflets have been available since implementation of the program and are widely available through a number of sources, including all Social Security regional offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the White Paper on Employment and Growth changes were not specifically directed to farmers and entitlements to payments will depend on individual circumstances, the introduction of Parenting Allowance may benefit some farm families. Parenting Allowance will be payable to the partners of low income earners with children and may therefore be payable to the partners of some farmers. Parenting Allowance will not be activity tested but will be subject to the JSA/NSA income and assets tests.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion 29: Rural debt</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.36 The Committee considers that, although rural debt is estimated to be $17 billion, this debt is a symptom rather than the cause of more fundamental and deep seated problems in rural Australia. The Committee believes that responses and solutions should be directed to the source of these problems rather that their repercussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reject</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not accept that the extent of adjustment problems in rural Australia can be described simply in terms of aggregate rural debt. While the level of debt may, in part, reflect the severity of international commodity trading conditions, seasonal conditions and other factors external to the individual farm business, it also is a vehicle used positively by farmers to manage risk, exploit commercial opportunities and raise the level of productivity with a view to higher future levels of profitability. Against this background, farm debt should not necessarily be seen as an undesirable feature of the farmer's financial position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges the accumulation of debt by some farmers due to circumstances, such as exceptional drought, that are outside their capacity for risk management. The Government is prepared to assist farm businesses in such situations through interest rate subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also aware of the importance of a commercial environment which facilitates international competitiveness, risk management and sustainable resource use. A comprehensive range of policies are in place to help farmers achieve these objectives.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion 29: Rural counselling program</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.12 During the inquiry the committee met with many rural counsellors throughout Australia. The Committee was impressed with their dedication and commitment to the rural communities in which they provided invaluable service. The Committee registers its strong support for the rural counselling program.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has recognised the need to support the rural community through the Rural Counselling Program since 1986, particularly those who are experiencing financial difficulties. It has expanded the provision of the counselling services to meet emerging needs across rural Australia. There are some 81 rural counselling positions throughout Australia with a further 12 new counsellors being established in drought affected areas. Rural counselling services play a vital role in rural industry adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion 31: Role of Government&mdash;income equalisation deposits scheme</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.25 The most consistent evidence the Committee received during the inquiry was that the Income Equalisation Deposit scheme is not attractive to farmers and needs to be changed significantly. The Committee reiterates the recommendation it made in its report on A National Drought Policy in 1992 that the Commonwealth Government must introduce an effective IED scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This response from the government, which has come along at long last&mdash;I believe it has taken longer than it should have&mdash;follows a period of rapid and painful change that has permeated every facet of life in the bush. In response to many representations from organisations and individuals in rural Australia, I moved and this Senate agreed in March 1994 to initiate an inquiry into the adequacy of the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That decision was made on 24 March 1994. The committee tabled this report in December 1994. Over a period of eight months, the committee&mdash;and I must recognise the significant contribution of the former chairman, Senator Burns&mdash;embarked on an exhaustive inquiry in order to present itself with the evidence and facts on which credible conclusions and recommendations could be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received something like 290 submissions. We held something like 17 public hearings throughout the country and took evidence from 262 witnesses. As I indicated earlier, the committee report tabled in December 1994 makes 27 recommendations and draws 33 major conclusions. Given that the government has taken nine months to respond to this report, I anticipated that what we would have in front of us today would be a detailed response to the report, providing a blueprint for rural Australia to readjust and revitalise. Obviously, the government or the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) has run out of ideas of trying to fix up the problems of readjusting and revitalising rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As chairman of the committee, I note the minister congratulates the committee on its thorough approach. I welcome that statement. I also welcome the statement that the government supports the thrust of the committee's report. However, when we go into detail in this document we find that for nine months the government has been sitting on its hands and that many of the fundamental and vital issues raised in the committee's report have been put into the too hard basket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's response indicates that a number of the committee's recommendations have already been implemented or are under active consideration. One would have thought that after nine months active consideration he would have given way to a much more positive policy implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things put to us at the inquiry were absolutely horrific. There were people from the Darling Downs in Queensland who had missed out on four years of cropping, which is eight crops for them. They have now missed out on another crop. They have had problems with mice, drought, frost and the problem of a government that has given lip service&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went up there and had a look around&mdash;but has not got to the guts and the gist of what needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that members of the committee would welcome the enhanced farm management bond scheme. We do. We welcome the removal of the link between re-establishment grants and the jobsearch allowance, and the new funding approach to regional adjustment. Yet it must be realised that these were the easy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reading of any transcript of evidence from the committee's inquiry indicates that these responses were necessary and obvious. But what about the hard issues? What about the hard things that go to the core of what rural adjustment is all about: the opportunity for people to get out of agriculture or into agriculture; the capital gains tax and the problems that creates for people in rural communities and  the problems with rural adjustment? In his response, the minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues surrounding re-establishment, training, exceptional circumstances support, farm business plans, orderly exit, young farmers and appeals mechanisms raised in the report have been under active consideration. A revised set of RAS guidelines are scheduled to be completed soon.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee said that it was convinced that sound financial and management skills were the key to a robust, flexible and profitable farm sector and recommended medium- to long-term skills enhancement, the other things I have just mentioned, and especially education, training and access to professional advice as very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another report of ours&mdash;the Austudy assets test report which I will be talking about in a moment&mdash;exemplified how necessary it is for farmers to have access to education and to have training so that they can continue as farmers, so their sons can come back on to the farm, or so they can adjust off the farm. There was a negative response to that report too, but I will talk about that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's response rightly recognised the committee's report and identified several major policy issues. They include: whether interest rate subsidies are an effective instrument to facilitate structural adjustment; whether the principal mechanism to deliver outcomes should be skills enhancement rather than productivity enhancement; and, most importantly, whether exceptional circumstances should be removed from RAS and included in a separate Commonwealth-state agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You only have to go to the central west of New South Wales and talk to the people who live between Mudgee and Bathurst, or go to the Hunter Valley and talk to the people who live there to understand the problem people have getting recognition of the fact that they are in exceptional circumstances. I have spoken quite often in this place about the problem with RASAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">RASAC was instituted for adjustment purposes. It advised the minister whether exceptional circumstances&mdash;from long and severe drought or substantial commodity price falls&mdash;existed in the rural sector, and whether changes should be made to the funding arrangements for RAS as a result. As I have said in this place before, I do not believe that RASAC has been doing as good a job as it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wrestled for nine months with the major issues and recorded our unanimous views. For nine months the minister has had the benefit of those views. It is not often you get a report where all members agree that something has to be done. Yet the government has sat on its hands for nine months and we are still waiting for changes to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the parlous state of rural Australia, will this review be conducted, as the minister tells us, in the next month or two or by the end of the year? The response from the minister tells us that it will be part of an evaluation to commence early next year and to be completed by 31 December 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say to the minister, and I am quite sure he will read the message I am trying to get to him on this one, that I do not know whether by the end of 1996 there are going to be that many farmers in a position to be readjusted because of the parlous state of different areas of Australia at the moment&mdash;in particular, some of those areas that I have mentioned in the Hunter Valley, the Darling Downs in Queensland, and in that area between Mudgee and Bathurst, that fine wool-growing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I basically say, Minister&mdash;and I do have some respect at times for Senator Collins, but in this particular case I believe that he has to move his department a lot quicker than he has been doing and he has to move his own legs a lot quicker than he has been moving them&mdash;that I am disappointed in your response. I am disappointed that a unanimous report by a Senate committee did not provide a platform from which you could project a blueprint to revitalise rural Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the election comes on quickly so that the Liberal and National parties, as a government, can actually take on board the suggestions that have been put in this document that has now been replied to by the government&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural adjustment, rural debt and rural reconstruction</EMPHASIS> report by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee&mdash;because basically it is a blueprint to help any minister get things right.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT REFERENCES COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO THE IMPACT OF ASSETS TESTS ON FARMING FAMILIES' ACCESS TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND AUSTUDY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of assets tests' impact on farming families' access to Social Security benefits and to AUSTUDY was referred to the committee on 30 June 1994 and 24 August 1994 respectively. On 31 August 1994, these references were combined. The committee's First Report deals with AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry was conducted through late 1994 and early 1995 at the worst point of the drought. Submissions were invited before the announcement of the Government's Drought Relief Package on 24 September 1994 and the Package came into effect just before the committee's main public hearings in October and November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee concludes that ". . . the assets test applied to farming families in order to determine eligibility for AUSTUDY is an inappropriate policy instrument that does not take into account the nature of farm assets and their relationship with income. In essence, the current assets test does not acknowledge that some farmers are assets rich but income poor and that farm assets cannot readily be liquidated without diminishing the viability of the farming unit. . . ". Four key considerations are cited. These are: evidence from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy that an estimated 5400 students from farm families are excluded by the assets test; the low retention and participation rates of rural students; evidence and submissions to the Inquiry about how access to AUSTUDY impacts on children's education; and the national interest of facilitating a well educated rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority conclusions are misplaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are important features of, and concessions in, the assets test to take account of compassionate individual circumstances. These include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">assets are taken into account at net current market value. If the market value of farm assets declines this is reflected in the amount of assets for the assets test. If debt increases, the net value of the assets decreases commensurately;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the 50% discount on farm/business assets. The discount differentiates between assets used by a person for his or her livelihood and those held chiefly for investment or wealth generation. AUSTUDY is intended to overcome financial barriers to education, not to subsidise families' investment choices. The discount reflects the intention that families should not be forced to sell their livelihood to support children in education;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the availability of reassessment of eligibility at any time when assets values diminish because of drought, economic downturn or debt burdens;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on this basis, current rules exclude only those farmers who, in the middle of the current crisis, have $750,000 or more of debt-free assets;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">making provision for disregarding the value of curtilage;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">waiver of the assets test where the families' need has clearly been established; that is, when a parent is getting a Commonwealth income support payment;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">concessions for specific circumstances of need. The Government's Drought Relief Package introduced 1 October 1994 gives families in "exceptional circumstances drought affected areas" exemption from the assets test if they get Drought Relief Payment Scheme (DRPS) benefits, or a 100% disregard of on-farm assets if they are not eligible or choose not to apply for DRPS;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Drought Relief Concessions were only newly introduced at the time of the committee's investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grounds cited by the majority of the committee do not justify the blanket disregard of on-farm assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is accepted that farming often is a capital intensive business, evidence as to farm asset values from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) and the ABARE Australian Agriculture and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS) (pg 39 et seq) does not establish that the current test ceiling is below the level at which farms are viable. The assets test does not exclude farmers per se, only wealthier ones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's findings that around 5,400 students from farming families are excluded from AUSTUDY by the assets test does not of itself justify changes to the test. These exclusions are consistent with the intent of the test and the objectives of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument that farm assets must be held intact is likewise unproven. Many families who fail the asset test because they have assets worth more than $375,000 (non-farm) or $750,000 (farm assets), net of debt, may not need to sell up assets at all, but rather to borrow against this equity. Where this is not possible, the family's assets are not limited to relatively `indivisible' land-holdings, improvements and fixtures, but will normally include many stand-alone assets (non-essential equipment or stock, or investment or personal assets) that could be cashed up without ruining the farm, if the family so chose. This may involve sacrifice. However, it is no more harsh than requiring a non-farm family to reduce its wealth, or forgo future financial gains, to self-provide for children's education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee also claims that, means-testing issues aside, there are compelling reasons to direct additional education assistance to farming families to overcome low retention and participation rates among rural students and ensure a more educated rural/farming population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the intention of providing student assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it remains conjectural whether access to AUSTUDY alone will achieve these objectives, or that the problem lies specifically with those families excluded from AUSTUDY on assets grounds. The committee itself recognises that "there may be various reasons for this, not the least being distance" (Conclusions, pg xi).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has not tested the underlying reasons for the claimed decline in rural education. These are likely to include issues of distance and the perceived value and relevance of education to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the Government's recognition of the special circumstances of farmers and the premium to be placed on education, the practical effects of relaxing the AUSTUDY assets test would be limited. The winners from the exemption of on-farm assets would be more wealthy families, including those with significant (up to $375,000) off-farm assets.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(a)That farm assets be excluded from the AUSTUDY assets test.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AUSTUDY assets test reflects the Government's intention that families with access to financial resources in the form of assets will normally draw on these before calling on AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assets test takes into account the special circumstances of farming families in a number of important ways. Asset values are calculated based on current market conditions and net of debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 50% discount applies to assets used in the conduct of the family farm (or business). This means that families can have up to $751,260 worth of farm assets net of debt before AUSTUDY ceases. To expect such families to self-provide for children's education is not unreasonable compared with those wage and salary and pensioner families at whom AUSTUDY is targeted (cutting out at joint parental incomes of around $32,000 pa, that is, parental per capita earnings of less than average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the special circumstances of drought-affected farmers, on 24 September 1994 the Prime Minister announced further concessions under the Drought Relief Package. Families in "exceptional circumstances drought affected areas" are exempt from AUSTUDY assets (and income) tests, while they are getting assistance under the Drought Relief Payment Scheme (DRPS), or can get an exemption (100% discount) for the value of on-farm assets, if they are not eligible or choose not to apply for the DRPS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, families can seek confidential valuations which fully take into account any downturn in economic conditions, for AUSTUDY purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these ways, the Government has acted to address the needs of farming families. The Government remains committed to the principle of assets testing of AUSTUDY benefits; AUSTUDY should continue to take into account families' full financial resources, including resources held in the form of assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(b)That the current discount of 50 per cent be increased substantially.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Dissenting Report lends qualified support to this recommendation, suggesting the discount be "re-examined". However, neither the majority nor the dissenting Members offer a recommendation as to what discount should be allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even a comparatively modest increase in the discount (to say, assess on-farm assets at 33%), would take this over the one million dollars mark. DPIE evidence to the committee suggests an average net assets value for disqualified broadacre and dairy farms of around $1.4m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding arguments about the special nature of farm assets, major difficulties would arise in being seen to continue to pursue tighter targeting of AUSTUDY to those in greatest need, while allowing some families with assets of over a million dollars to get assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(c)That the AUSTUDY Supplement be extended to include a category of dependent students who meet all other AUSTUDY eligibility requirements, except the assets test.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes that comprehensive concessions exist to ensure that the AUSTUDY assets test does not unfairly penalise families in genuine need. The Government does not propose to introduce supplement loans for families with assets outside allowable limits. This is consistent with the Government's decision, announced in the 1995 Budget, to abolish Category 2 Supplement loans to students whose parental incomes are over AUSTUDY cut off but less than $50,850.</PARA>

Basically, if you listened to the evidence and if you listened to what people were telling us, the other members of the committee would have realised that we were actually putting to the Senate the problems associated with the people getting access to education in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is really disappointing, I believe, is the government's lack of understanding in its reasoning for rejecting the committee's findings. The majority report, in my view, quite accurately reflects the overwhelming evidence and must be the basis of any committee consideration. I would argue that the inflexibility in practice of the assets test militates quite strongly against farm families and their access to rural education, and the figures demonstrably show that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) suggests in his reply that, if a farmer has assets of over $750,000-odd, obviously he can afford to send his children away for tertiary education. That implies that, if things get a little tight, they can chop an acre or so off the back paddock and realise some assets. I would have to say that this is probably the only disagreement I think I have had with Senator Burns on our committee. He just cannot quite get the grasp of selling off an acre from the back of the farm, but I am quite sure he will say something in a minute or two about this particular matter. We have to remember that with farm families it is not only a case of tertiary education fees, but also a need for accommodation and board. So it is not a case of them just getting one thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the government's totally misplaced understanding of the rural sector, I am not surprised that it has rejected the exemption from the assets test, but I cannot accept in any manner the claim that the current 50 per cent discount should not be increased. Again, there is this misplaced thinking that, if farm assets are worth X dollars, the children should be penalised and the parents are obviously able to afford the education. Of course, the government says to these families that they have curtilage&mdash;maybe two hectares and a house&mdash;which is not part of the assets test. But people who live in the city and get less than $20,000-odd in income can get Austudy. It does not matter what their house is worth because that is their home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a time of major adjustment in agriculture and with the need to increase educational opportunities for farm children, particularly in non-agricultural related areas, it mystifies me that the government is saying that assistance cannot be given. Look at the evidence we received at the rural adjustment scheme inquiry, which I made mention of a little while ago. We have to have better educated people on the farm, and we have to give people the opportunity to get their sons off the farm so that not so many people are looking for income from whatever acreage they happen to have. The rural sector has to adjust. There is no doubt about that. But, while the government mouths platitudes about adjustment, it does not provide the mechanisms by which the adjustment procedure can occur. Not allowing the removal of farm assets in rural situations to allow rural children equal access to education is an indictment on this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming opinion expressed in evidence to the inquiry was that farm assets should be excluded from the assets test. The view was firmly based on the proposition that the assets test is not an appropriate indicator of the wealth of a property. Lots of properties, as everyone would know from looking at ABARE figures or whatever, have received income well below $20,000-odd. Why we have to condemn children whose parents have an asset in excess of $750,000 and an income which is nil to not having the same access to education as everyone else in the community absolutely mystifies me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the government to the evidence from not only farmers and farming organisations but other groups with genuine concerns about equity and access to education and the survival of the rural sector in Australia. One of those groups was the Catholic Women's League of Australia. They were emphatic that the farm should not be classed as an asset under Austudy criteria. The league stated that the farm is not a negotiable commodity which will pay for the education of children. It is basically a tool of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian Rural Counselling Association&mdash;I notice Senator Calvert, who is from Tasmania, is in the chamber this afternoon; he would understand this&mdash;told the committee that our society has acknowledged the need for the young to achieve the best education at their disposal, but due to the assets test for Austudy a direct effort is being made to make further education for rural families a dream and not a reality. I think those are pretty fair words in the evidence we received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Women in Agriculture emphasised the importance of education and its future significance for the farming sector. They rightly maintained that the younger generation on the farms need the opportunity to access education so that moving in are not only young farmers, but young farmers better educated than the generation before. That is what I said a little while ago. Young people have to have the opportunity to get off the farm so that farmers can readjust. If you lived in Sydney, Mr Acting Deputy President, your kids could get Austudy if you were getting less than $20,000-odd, but these kids out on the farms cannot. Education is a basic right&mdash;not a privilege. We want everyone in Australia to be better educated, but young people in country areas are definitely being discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My disappointment with the government's response to this report is heightened by the fact that its whole approach to rural Australia is now patently inconsistent. People have been talking about it today. I think the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Robert Ray) said here today in his speech on the debate to take note of answers that our real interest rates are not high. They are high, for God's sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Costs and charges on the farming sector are absolutely horrific when you look at other countries in the world. Killing costs for livestock in New Zealand are $100 per beast less than they are here. On the one hand, we are told that it is imperative for farmers to be better educated and to be better managers, better scientists and better technologists. Yet when faced with the opportunity to realise that goal through Austudy, the government has failed to meet its responsibilities, as was recognised in the report. Education is a right; it is not a privilege.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those on the other side of the chamber had better think about that. They should think about it every time they go out to people in country areas who have been denied decent education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the government's own departments, the DPIE, has demonstrated that 5,400 students who would otherwise have been eligible to receive Austudy on the basis of income alone would have been excluded because of the assets test. We were advised that if these young people were provided with the opportunity for further study the cost to government would be in the order of $15 million. That is not much more than those opposite waste every day, I would say. That is nowhere near what it is costing us to service our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the national interest for young people from farming families to have access to educational opportunities in order for this productive sector to remain competitive and technologically innovative. It is not in the national interests for rural kids to be denied their right to a decent education, which those on the other side of the chamber are denying them this very day and this very hour. </PARA>

As Senator Brownhill has already said, in the letter from the minister there were congratulations on the way in which we took a thorough approach to the terms of reference and of the fact that we presented a well-balanced report. Further, he indicated his pleasure that the committee supports the policy settings of the current scheme, particularly the three-pronged objectives of farm productivity, profitability and sustainability.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports the thrust of the committee's report and recognises the committee's concerns about aspects of administration and management of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>He indicated to us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has a program of measures in place to more effectively deliver the program to the target groups and monitor the performance of the scheme against its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say much more, but in a general sense he said that we had done a good job and that he was prepared to make further changes in regard to the scheme that would improve it. One of the propositions the committee put was that the scheme  must be improved and changed. The committee is of the view that there is considerable confusion in the rural community about the focus and objectives of the scheme. That is the way it came out in the evidence. People really did not understand what was intended and did not understand the direction of the scheme. If you look at the government's response, you will see that it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, in conjunction with the states and territories and the RAS authorities, will develop a communication strategy to address this problem for implementation during 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA>So they are going to address that situation and remove the misunderstandings that are there in terms of some people's view of the scheme. Again, we have some agreement there and the government will further consider the name of the program and the mix of instruments for achieving its objectives&mdash;the sorts of suggestions we made in relation to changes in the scheme. In relation to section 232, it was indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recognises that in relation to Commonwealth-state agreements a fine balance needs to be drawn between guidance or direction and the need for administrative flexibility in the delivery of programs arising from Commonwealth-state agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>This committee, when looking at the progress made in developing a drought policy and implementation of the drought policy on a previous occasion, went to great pains to produce an interim report so that the states and the Commonwealth representatives could examine that when they were together looking at the particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has always believed that there is a necessity for the Commonwealth and the states to work fairly closely together to achieve what, in my view, is the bottom line.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)condemns the Government for deliberately pursuing taxation policies which have widened the gap between rich and poor, and which have devastated middle Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1985 the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), introduced a series of taxation reforms which were, according to him, designed&mdash;and this was a promise on the government's part&mdash;to relieve the tax load on middle income Australians. The clear situation that has emerged 10 years later is that Australia's tax policies over that period have utterly failed to achieve that goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the release this week of a report commissioned from the very reputable and highly respected consulting firm, Access Economics. That firm has done a study of Australia's tax system 10 years after the so-called major tax reforms were introduced. That study shows that people today on average weekly earnings, without any adjustments being made, are paying just $4 a week less income tax than they were 10 years ago when the so-called reforms to reduce income tax were announced&mdash;and those reforms, I remind the Senate, were designed or said to be designed primarily to ease and shift the tax load off middle income Australians. To gain just $4 on the unadjusted calculations after 10 years is a miserable result indeed, as I am sure everyone in this place would agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is even worse when you make the necessary adjustments taking into account the compulsory superannuation contributions that have been introduced into the system since then. When you make the necessary adjustments to include those contributions&mdash;and of course they should be included because workers have traded wage rises and tax cuts in order to obtain them&mdash;then those on average weekly earnings today are paying almost 20 per cent more tax as a proportion of their income than they were 10 years earlier. So much for the claim by the government at the time of the introduction of those reforms in 1985 that it was going to lift the tax burden; indeed, quite the opposite has occurred as far as middle income Australians are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians on half average weekly earnings, or average weekly earnings or up to twice average weekly earnings&mdash;and that, of course, is the overwhelming majority of income recipients in Australia&mdash;are worse off now in terms of tax paid than they were 10 years ago. The only income group in Australia that is paying a smaller proportion of its income in income tax than it was 10 years ago is the high income earners&mdash;that is, those earning more than $70,000, or thereabouts, or more. Why is that so, from a government that purported to be on the side of middle Australia? Look at what it has done in relation to all the other imposts and charges that have been imposed on Australians and the unemployment that has occurred as a result of the recession in the last few years of Labor's reign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that in this financial year the government will be levying $80,000 million more taxes and charges on Australians than was the case in the last year of the previous coalition government. This year the government will levy taxes and charges of $125,000 million on Australian taxpayers, and that is just at the Commonwealth level. In the last year of the Fraser coalition government, 1982-83, the government levied taxes and charges totalling $44,000 million. So there has been not far short of a threefold increase in the tax take by the federal government during the 12 to 13 years of the Keating and Hawke Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if you believe Mr Keating, it has been a Keating Labor government right throughout that period. He was the Treasurer before he was Prime Minister. Of course, he boasted that he pulled all the levers of economic policy and made all the major economic policy decisions during the time of Mr Hawke's prime ministership. So, really, during 13 years of Keating domination of government in Australia, the tax bill has gone up by an unbelievable $80,000 million. No wonder not only middle income Australians but virtually all Australians, other than the very high income earners, have suffered mightily under the tax policies of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only two years ago, at the time of the 1993 election, that Prime Minister Keating, fighting his first election, absolutely conned the Australian public with promises of tax cuts. In that election campaign in 1993, Paul Keating promised the taxpayers of Australia tax cuts totalling $14 billion&mdash;$14,000 million. The result has been that, since the election, the Prime Minister has far from delivered tax cuts; he has delivered $18,000 million of tax rises instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget alone, the Prime Minister broke his promise to lower the company tax rate to 33 per cent. What did he do? He increased it to 36 per cent. That is an increase of three percentage points on the proposed rate of 33 per cent; it is an almost 10 per cent increase. He broke his promise not to increase the Medicare levy. He increased it from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent. He broke his promise to pay the second tranche of the l-a-w, law, personal income tax cuts&mdash;a promise on which he arguably won the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the 1993 election, the Prime Minister started working on how he could break his promise. He and then Treasurer Dawkins are on the public record the very week after the 1993 election as saying that they had started working on how to break that tax promise. In the 1993 budget, the Prime Minister started off saying that the introduction of the tax cuts would be deferred from 1 January 1996 until 1998. Now he has abandoned those tax cuts altogether. Instead, what he has done is to try to make the absolutely spurious claim that he is delivering them by another route; that is, through superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows, including the Australian public, that that is quite simply a lie. No-one is going to get any benefit from those contributions for very many years. Someone entering the work force now as a young person would have to wait until something like the year 2040 before they could get the maximum benefits that are promised. How on earth could anyone believe a promise that Mr Keating made to deliver something in the year 2040 when he cannot even keep his promise to deliver something within a period of 12 months? So the Prime Minister's argument in that regard is a total sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the 1993 election, the Prime Minister broke his promise not to increase indirect taxes. Remember when he said that he was not going to increase indirect taxes? So what did he do in the very first budget after the 1993 election? He increased sales tax by two per cent, and now there is an extra five per cent sales tax on cars. That two per cent increase on a sales tax rate of 10 per cent is an increase of 20 per cent. A two per cent increase on goods which are levied at a sales tax rate of 20 per cent also results in a high figure. In fact, it is a 10 per cent increase. There have been very steep increases in sales tax. The sales tax take estimated for 1995-96 is about 50 per cent higher than it was just three or so years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also broke his promise not to try to expand the indirect tax base. He made two promises: firstly, that he would not expand the tax base and, secondly, that he would not increase indirect tax rates. In the 1995 budget, he proposed a major expansion in the indirect tax base, with the proposal for a new tax on building materials at 12 per cent. All of these increases were part of Labor's quite disgracefully deceitful 1993 re-election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt at all that this Labor government is a very high tax government, not just for middle income Australians but for all Australians. The rates of increase in real revenue this year, 1995-96, and last year, 1994-95, are 8.9 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively. They are the highest growth rates recorded in consecutive years in terms of increased taxation since the quite infamous and totally economy destroying high taxing Whitlam budgets of 1973 and 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is the government taxing in this massive way but it is also doing it in a quite deceitful and untruthful way. It promises lower taxes but it delivers higher taxes. This promise of one thing and delivering quite the opposite has become the trademark of this government and, in particular, this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993 budget&mdash;the budget of Treasurer John Dawkins, who was put in there by Prime Minister Keating; I remind the Senate that this budget was after the 1993 election&mdash;the government increased sales tax, despite a promise to the contrary, it deferred the much vaunted personal income tax and it massively raised petrol excise. Over four years these extra imposts alone have increased the total tax take by over $11,000 million. The result of all this is that today in Australia we have amongst the highest income taxes of all OECD countries. The OECD studies and the surveys done by the highly respected journal, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist&mdash;</EMPHASIS>those surveys were taken earlier this year&mdash;show that Australia ranked as the fifth highest taxing country of average income earners after taking account of family benefits. An Ernst and Young survey carried out earlier this year has also shown that in eight out of nine scenarios examined by that company, Australians paid more income tax than their American, Japanese or British equivalents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding the Senate just what this government has promised to the Australian people and what it got its latest mandate&mdash;that is, the winning of the 1993 election&mdash;for and as a result of. Prior to that election, the Treasurer said, `We will not be introducing new taxes.' The Prime Minister said, `What I'm promising is not to put up tax.' The finance minister said, `We do not intend to increase the overall burden of taxation.' The Prime Minister also said, `I don't think the incidence of taxation should rise.' Those commitments are just some of the very worst examples of contempt ever played out on the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Top income tax rates? Have you seen what you have done to virtually every Australian? As I said, you have given some benefit to the high-fliers in Australia, the high income earners. With regard to the 98 per cent of people who earn less than $70,000 a year, you have clobbered them, you have hit them to leg, with the massive income tax increases and also a whole raft of indirect tax increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Labor came to office in 1983, the earnings of the least well paid 10 per cent of workers have actually declined in real terms by just on one per cent. Over the same period, the earnings of the highest paid 10 per cent of workers have increased by 17 per cent. So you have increased the well-being of those at the top and you have worsened the situation of those at the bottom. There has been a massive widening of the gap between rich and poor in this country and you have developed what is in grave danger of becoming a permanent underclass in this country. For a government that espouses social justice, equity and a fair go for all Australians in an egalitarian Australia, everything that you have done has been in absolute defiance of the rhetoric that you mouth on those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 12 nations surveyed by the OECD on these types of matters, only three&mdash;that is, Australia, the United States and Canada&mdash;experienced a real decline in the earnings of the least well paid 10 per cent of workers in the last decade. The fall in Australia was larger than that in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the earnings for this group&mdash;that is, the bottom 10 per cent&mdash;actually increased by 11 per cent. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has shown that the share of income which goes to the bottom 10 per cent of income units fell between 1981-82 and 1989-90. However, the share going to the top 10 per cent increased by two to three percentage points over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can go on and on quoting these figures, but they all add up to one thing&mdash;the widening of the gap between rich and poor in this country and the deliberate pursuit by the government of taxation policies which have caused this gap to widen, which have devastated middle Australia and which fly absolutely and totally in the face of the rhetoric and promises that have been mouthed by this government over its period in office. They are promises which have only been honoured in the breach. As a result, virtually all Australians have suffered a fall in their living standards because of the deliberate policies&mdash;it is not an accident&mdash;and the economic mismanagement of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government stands condemned for its economic management record.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)notes that in announcing tax reforms in 1985 the then Treasurer (Mr Keating) said that his aim was to relieve the tax burden on middle-income Australians;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to read the whole motion at the moment, but the fact of the matter and the essence of the motion are that, as Senator Short has just said, 95 per cent to 98 per cent of income earners earn under $70,000. Sadly, it is those very people who have been disadvantaged the most in the 10 years since that statement was made by the then Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of that tax summit in 1985. The summit was more or less a forum, I suppose, for the Labor Party to decide upon its tax policy, albeit, I might note, after the election. There was no policy that the Labor Party went to the election with, and they now have the audacity to ask what our policy is for the next election. Well, we've got news for the Labor Party&mdash;you are not going to be invited into the dining room yet. You can wait as long as you like, but we are going to release our policies at a time of our choosing. The fact of the matter is that it will be very different to the performance of the 1985 Labor government victory when you announced it after the election. We will not be doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The linchpin of that same summit was supposed to be a consumption tax. Who put that forward? No-one other than the current Prime Minister, Mr Keating. At that forum, the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax were also born. Both taxes have been an unmitigated disaster for many areas of small business and individuals, but that does not seem to worry this government. Both taxes are now in dire need of reform, with the latter in particular affecting many middle income Australians quite significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we are yet to see any proposal by the Labor government of any area of reform, particularly in the area of fringe benefits tax. The area of fringe benefits tax is costing an enormous amount of jobs. It is also costing a lot in terms of the income attributed to a company, which then takes away that money that could subsequently be spent on further employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the inception in 1983 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which has now had 2,500 pages of amendments added to it, it has become the most complex document&mdash;a minefield&mdash;that anyone could wish to imagine. In an effort to supposedly help the taxpayers, the government puts out a thing called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> every year. We find this year that those average income earners who try to save a bit of money and do their own tax returns have again been led down the wrong channels by the government in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we have is that this government shows little or no respect for the very people that it claims to represent. This government no longer represents the middle income earner of Australia or, in fact, the low income earner of Australia. This government has been prepared to put a million people out of work. The latest figures that the ABS can provide are the 1992 figures, which are sadly out of date and very much underestimated now. But at that time, 24 per cent of all families had no family member employed and 17 per cent of children&mdash;in other words, 700,000 children&mdash;lived in a family where neither parent worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the government has done to the middle and low income earners. That does not seem to worry it at all, and at the same time it has been putting up taxes. I might add that we need to remember that this is the government that promised no extra taxes. As I was saying in an earlier debate today, we have seen taxes rise, rise and rise&mdash;particularly, but not only, since the 1993 commitment of no extra taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extra 2,500 pages of amendments that have been added to the Income Tax Assessment Act certainly have not served to relieve the burden of taxation. Quite the reverse: they have added bit by bit to the income pressure on most average households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the cost of compliance with these extra measures has also exploded with Australians bearing a compliance cost of about nine per cent compared with our Canadian and British counterparts, for example, who face compliance costs of about two per cent and three per cent respectively. For small business&mdash;an area where many average or middle income Australians make their living&mdash;this is a hefty burden consuming valuable resources and time and limiting their scope for expansion and further economic contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To alleviate that burden, the coalition believes it is imperative that tax laws be simplified and compliance costs for individuals and businesses be reduced. At every election we have put forward policies to do just that. At the last election the examples were just so crystal clear of how those policies could be misrepresented and lied about to the point where yesterday this parliament had to pass legislation to oblige you, the Labor Party and everyone else, but specifically the Labor Party from past experience, to tell the truth in advertising during election campaigns. Had our policies not been so badly misrepresented and lied about, that type of legislation yesterday would have been totally and utterly unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area where middle income Australians are hard hit is at the bank. Not only are they hit by bank transaction fees, but they are hit by tax on the interest they earn, as well as having been taxed initially on their income. There is no allowance for inflation. All in all it is a pretty sorry scenario. A recent EPAC report agreed, having found that tax on the bank accounts of Australians was imposed at a rate much higher than Asian nations for example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report also noted that the tax imposed on average incomes in Australia was higher than the OECD average. The difference&mdash;52.4 per cent as opposed to 41.5 per cent&mdash;is considerable. Yet this government says we are leading the world. That is sheer and utter arrant nonsense. A recent report from Access Economics shows Australians are paying more in tax now than they ever were in the past decade. Who is bearing the burden of that increase? Low and middle income earners&mdash;98 per cent of people who earn less than $70,000 a year. We are so bogged down in our taxation system that really the whole thing should be torched and started again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way you have increased taxes right across the board is something that middle income Australians cannot absorb. They are not getting increases in their income the way in which you are increasing their taxes. Yet you do not seem to worry about that. Ideally tax legislation should go back to the basics. You refuse to go back to the basics. You just keep amending the tax legislation. As I said, with 2,500 pages of amendments, you just make it more complex and more difficult for them to handle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 14 January this year, David Castle, national chairman of the Barker Gosling Legal Group, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ideally tax legislation should go back to basics and have the sole objective of raising revenue fairly.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that it was time to pressure the government on this issue `with strict instructions that tax legislation should be designed only to raise the necessary revenue and not to serve a multiplicity of other purposes'. One of these days you might listen to some of these suggestions that have been put to you. They are not gratuitous suggestions or advice. They are some very sound, logical measures that could be taken so we would not see so many people disaffected by your increases in taxes and the increases in complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a point well made, particularly stressing that taxation legislation is not fair. It is certainly not fair to those paying the highest proportion&mdash;the low and middle income earners. I am sure that middle-income Australia would be ecstatic to learn that the burden of taxation upon them has been relieved, which is the line that this government continues to push. If only that were t-r-u-e but it is not. People know that it is not. They know they are paying more taxes now than they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at sales tax, a tax which is hidden in the price of every item we purchase and a tax which has been steadily creeping up under the Labor government. Fuel tax has gone up 7c a litre since the government won the last election. Since it last promised at the polls that it would not increase taxes, fuel tax has risen 7c a litre. We can only presume that that has added to the cost of everything else. It has. Added to that, the government has put up sales tax and a whole range of other taxes as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Middle Australia is ripe for the picking in terms of taxation dollars. The Labor Party knows it and they continually celebrate the harvest with great glee and gusto because every time they bring down a budget that is the area that is most heavily hit. This travesty of justice has seen the gap between rich and poor widen significantly over the past decade. Social studies show that the economic gap has widened considerably. So much for the myth that the Labor Party is concerned about equality amongst Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Labor Party has presided over a government that has intentionally widened the gap between rich and poor, they deserve to be dismissed. They will be dismissed at the next election because middle Australia can no longer afford this government. They cannot make ends meet, they cannot afford to be out of work, and they cannot afford their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned before, way back in 1972 there were 700,000 children none of whose parents had a job. Just imagine what the figure is today. The cold, hard reality is that since 1983 real incomes have fallen. When you add the forthcoming tax burden of compulsory superannuation contributions, real incomes will fall further still. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Media reports on the widening economic gap are a regular occurrence. I have a handful here, headed by such bleak phrases as `Life gets tougher on the wrong side of the tracks', `The search for social equality', `Have-nots see social gap widen', `Traditional families suffer in the 90s', and `The rich continue to grow richer'. That is just a small selection of the headings that reflect the cornerstone of this government's policy which has widened the gap between rich and poor. That, we would contest, is simply not fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not reflect the supposed intentions of the government not to tax middle Australia to the hilt. Quite the opposite: it tells a sad story of Aussie battlers, many of whom, I expect, will turn their backs on the Labor Party at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was stated in April that the income gap between the top and bottom five per cent of households almost doubled between 1976 and 1991, producing a gap of $20,144 or 92 per cent. That data came from a study by Reserve Bank board members and an academic from the Australian National University. The report also said that the study served as a reminder to the Prime Minister that it was traditional Labor voters who had suffered the most over the past 12 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact, as the study showed, that incomes of people in the average to poorer suburbs had fallen 23 per cent while those in the richest areas had seen their incomes grow by the same amount, is quite disturbing. That was before the budget, which delivered more tax hikes at all levels. It pushed personal taxation up 13.6 per cent, making Mr Keating the highest taxing Prime Minister in Australia's history. If that is a record of which you wish to be proud, good luck to you, because the Australian people will tolerate it no longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to point out some of the key elements of Senator Short's motion that we are debating here today. There is a reference to the Access Economics report, which I will deal with in some detail a little later. There is a comment in respect of compulsory superannuation contributions. I will be touching on that area, but I think one of my colleagues will deal with that in more detail and develop some of the issues there. There is also a reference to our tax rates being in the middle of the field of the OECD and very high by regional standards, and I will be making some comments about that as well. I will also be making some reference to the contributions of opposition speakers Senator Short and Senator Knowles as I go through my comments this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this debate and the motion that Senator Short has moved, because I am proud of what we have accomplished in the general areas of taxation, social security and Medicare over the last decade since we have been in office. I am proud of it, and I do not shy away from our record. If we look at it in totality&mdash;rather than make the narrow and very glib and superficial analysis that has been made by Senator Short and by Senator Knowles on these issues&mdash;if we look at the total income receipts of people in Australia, their total service delivery in the areas of superannuation and Medicare, and if we compare where we are with our Asian neighbours and with countries of the OECD, this country is one of the best in the world to live in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dealing with the Access Economics report, which has been referred to in the debate and also in the motion, we see a number of deficiencies in the report. We reject the allegation that, compared with 10 years ago, there has been an increase in the Australian tax burden. We reject the analysis that the indirect taxation system remains narrowly based. Presumably that is saying, `Well, we should have a GST.' We will not be subscribing to a GST. It also says that Australians would be paying less tax under Fightback&mdash;that word the opposition never want to mention any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How times have changed. I do not want to reflect too much on the past, but I can recall debates on these sorts of issues three years ago. Opposition members had this big document, a couple of hundred pages thick, called Fightback. Every time we came in here to debate an issue, they were flashing the Fightback document in front of us and boasting about it. It was almost like a bible really. The evangelical opposition were holding up their bible of policy about what they were going to do to Australia. Now have they gone in the opposite direction. Not only are they trying to forget Fightback&mdash;never mention it again&mdash;but now they are boasting, `Let's not have any policies. Let's go to the election campaign and not have any policies.' I think the Australian electorate is a little bit smarter than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Access Economics report is based on a selective and a misleading interpretation of taxation statistics. I know we all quote statistics to support our cases, but the use and abuse of statistics has really reached an art form in the opposition's contribution in this and other policy debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the personal tax regime, we have made extensive reform of the income tax system over the past decade. That has been targeted not just at higher income earners, as the opposition allege, but at lower and middle income earners. Over the past decade, the marginal rate of tax for middle income earners has been cut from 46c in the dollar to 34c in the dollar. That is indisputable fact; it is fact. There is no mention of it by any in the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom marginal tax rate has been cut by one-third, from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. That is fact. It is irrefutable fact. The effective tax-free threshold, taking into account the low income rebate, has been boosted by more than a third. Again, that is fact, but we hear nothing of it from the opposition. Total income tax revenue raised from individuals has declined from 13.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1984-85 to 12 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we reconcile this set of facts with, for example, Senator Knowles statement that income tax receipts in the last budget increased by 13.6 per cent? There is a very simple explanation. The reason why income receipts are going up is that employment is going up. It is not because income tax levels are going up but because employment is going up. More people are employed, so therefore the tax receipts of government in the income tax area go up. That is why in the budget the total receipts from income tax have increased by 13.6 per cent. That is a testimony to the government's success in boosting employment&mdash;not a testimony to the government increasing the tax burden. That is a very good example of how the opposition misuse statistics in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the Access Economics report: the conclusion that Australians have experienced an increased tax burden is based on a false premise.

Less than 40 per cent of the work force&mdash;and they were higher income earners; and including public servants, I might say&mdash;were getting very significant superannuation, but the lower to middle income earner generally was getting no superannuation at all and not, therefore, deriving any tax benefit.

The increase in the share of indirect tax revenue as a proportion of non-income tax revenue reflects a decline in other sources of revenue. A couple are important to highlight. Firstly, this government handed over debits tax to the states. We do not get any thanks for it. All they do is complain. They want more and more; spend more and more; and complain more and more. If you get into government&mdash;I see Senator Campbell smiling&mdash;wait and see the troubles the state governments give you. You must admit that the state governments really do want it both ways.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that excise revenues are declining fails to recognise that some of the excise revenue which was collected as crude oil excise is now collected as petroleum resource rent tax&mdash;a direct tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax measures are not just there to raise revenue; they do serve a range of other purposes. One of the reasons for the increase in the excise on leaded fuel was as an environmental measure. It serves an important purpose. Again, I cannot give the figures to the Senate, but I have looked at the consumption figures for lead petrol vis-a-vis unleaded petrol. I think last year for the first time we were consuming more unleaded petrol than leaded petrol. I was at an industry conference held here in Parliament House where industry accepted that, if we were to phase out leaded petrol, we had to have a price differential between leaded and unleaded petrol. That is one of the other reasons for restructuring the tax system. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to compare Australia with other countries in the OECD. I think it is very important for us to have a look at this issue. The August 1995 release of the annual publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Revenue Statistics of OECD Member Countries</EMPHASIS> shows that, in 1993, Australia had the second lowest ratio of total tax revenue to GDP in the OECD. We were the sixth lowest in 1985, the third lowest in 1990 and the second lowest in 1991-92. Australian tax revenue in 1993 was 28.7 per cent of gross domestic product compared with an OECD unweighted average of 38.7. This is marginally higher than the equivalent figure for 1992, when Australian tax revenue was 28.6 per cent of gross domestic product compared with an OECD unweighted average of 38.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am just getting wound up in this debate. I think I will need that extension. Senator Panizza is not looking at me very hopefully, though I think the Burnie debate of the last sitting fortnight might have scared him off giving me extensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, I do get a bit boring reading out the figures and the statistics. But they are sound statistics that support our case. Really, to sum it up in a nutshell&mdash;and I am not going to conclude&mdash;we are a very low taxed country by OECD standards, yet we provide a range of comprehensive social security safety net measures such as a sound education system, a sound health system and a sound retirement superannuation pension system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think by international comparison those measures stand up very well, that is, with countries with which you can make a valid comparison&mdash;the OECD, the advanced economic countries. One of the reasons we are able to do that is because we are one of the most rigorous countries in the world when it comes to means-testing. If you were to go to the United States and say, `We are going to target social security payments and take them away from upper and middle income earners,' there would be a massive reaction to that sort of proposal. In many of these countries they are paying social security payments to people who have high incomes. That is something that we do not do in Australia, and that is one of the reasons why we have been able to have rational, more efficient, more equitable systems of tax and social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD publication contains preliminary data for 1994 for Australia but not for the USA or Japan. This data shows Australia's tax to GDP ratio increasing slightly in 1994. However, it is still likely that Australia has retained its position very near the bottom of the OECD tax to GDP ratios. On the basis of the figures published for 1993, Australia's tax base remains very similar in its broad aggregate to that of other OECD countries. It is wrong to conclude that Australia's tax base is relatively narrow simply because in 1993 taxes on incomes and profits contributed 53.7 per cent of all tax revenue, compared with the unweighted OECD average of 36.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If social security contributions and payroll taxes are added to taxes on incomes and profits, the contribution in 1993 to total tax revenue from these taxes in Australia is 59.8 per cent. It was well below the unweighted OECD average of 63.2 per cent. Taxes on goods and services generated 29.8 per cent of Australia's total tax revenue, just below the unweighted OECD average of 30.1 per cent. Property taxes accounted for 10.4 per cent of total Australian revenue in 1993, compared to the OECD unweighted average of 5.7 per cent. Who levies property taxes in this country? Not this federal Labor government, but the state and local governments. We can hardly be blamed for the higher than average revenue in the area of property taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to bore you with statistics, but in the total personal tax area: Australia, 11.7 per cent of gross domestic product; Britain, 11.5 per cent; Japan, 11.2 per cent; and the United States, 13.6 per cent. We all tend to think, with the so-called compact with America and the revolution going on in the United States in the tax and budget area, that the US is a low taxing country. It is not, interestingly. The OECD average is 14.7 per cent. In relation to goods and services: Australia, 8.6 per cent; Britain, 11.9 per cent; Japan, 4.2 per cent; the US, 5.1 per cent; and the OECD average, 11.6 per cent.

Government speakers parrot off, as has Senator Sherry, about the number of jobs they have created from this system. I can tell you that any creation of jobs in Australia over the last couple of years has been as a result of the state Liberal governments that have sprung up in the last few years. For instance, in Western Australia 90,000 new jobs have been created since February 1993. When you have a better managed government, more jobs are created. The state Liberal government started projects such as the gas line into the north-west. My friend on the other side could not decry that project.

Perhaps these underemployed are just a figment of the opposition's imagination. It could be said that they are a figment of anyone's imagination, but they are real, and the statistics show where the current government has failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some statistics here. The Australian Bureau of Statistics collects precise figures on the number of employed, unemployed and underemployed every month. It was doing this long before the famous Keating tax package of 1985. What he said in 1984 in that tax summit changed a lot between then and 1995. I can remember vividly him saying in the 1984 election that there would be no FBT. Anyhow, that is history now. We have got it and it is a growing cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures come out every month, and every month the government quotes them for the employed and the unemployed. But the underemployed are never mentioned. The Australian Bureau of Statistics precisely defines the underemployed as those part-time employed persons who prefer to work more hours, plus full-time employed persons who work less than 35 hours a week. In other words, they are the ones who are partly employed but would like to work full time. So the underemployed are those who have some work, as I said, but not always as much as they would like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To test the true impact of the Keating taxation reforms, you have to go back to 1985. It was recorded in 1985 that there were 607,600 unemployed, or 8.4 per cent of the labour force. But it was also recorded in 1985 that there were 225,000 underemployed, or 3.1 per cent of the labour force. So you have to add those figures. This meant at that time that 11.5 per cent of the total work force were either unemployed or underemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at the comparable figures for June this year, exactly 10 years later, to see how much this government has come forward with the famous tax package of 1985. The present Bureau of Statistics figures for June this year show that there are 724,800 unemployed. That is down on the massive unemployment figures of the recession we had to have, but a rise of 117,200 on the figure 10 years ago. Okay, you can tell me that there is more population and all that sort of thing, but unemployment has gone up to 724,000 in 1985, a rise of 117,000 in 10 years. This represents 8.1 per cent of the work force, or a fall of only 0.03 per cent on the 1985 figure. </PARA>

The number has increased by almost 200 per cent over those 10 years, with an additional 372,000 people forced by Keating-created economic policies to accept less than they are prepared to work for.

If any senator opposite can tell me that, then some of us may be able to make use of it. But the fact is that Mr Willis is wrong again, because you still have to file a tax return and pay tax. If you are self-employed you pay provisional tax and contracting work is picked up by prescribed payments, particularly around the building industry.

It will be looked back on in years to come as one of the most significant social and economic advances ever achieved in the history of this country, and it took a Labor government to do it. What it did was guarantee present and future Australians a right, an entitlement, to a better and a secure retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, back in 1983 less than 40 per cent of the Australian work force received superannuation. Today that figure is in excess of 90 per cent. The entire work force in this country will eventually be entitled to a decent superannuation scheme. Today, more importantly, superannuation entitlements extend to low and middle income workers. Why is that the case? In 1983 and subsequently, the Labor government, in conjunction with the trade union movement in this country and very few but some enlightened employers, recognised that superannuation had to become an industrial award right. </PARA>

It was opposed by the employer ranks in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza did say that this superannuation payment of three per cent, as it was then&mdash;it is now four or five per cent, depending on the particular size of the work force that you are involved in&mdash;was a forgone wage increase. That is partly true because the initial three per cent superannuation payment was negotiated as an entitlement to be brought into awards in lieu of a claim for national productivity. So it was in one sense a deferred wage increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what was more important about it was that, rather than just paying another three per cent at that time when wage restraint was necessary and when the union movement and the workers of this country recognised that in the interests of the Australian economy we needed to have wage restraint, it was agreed to pay that entitlement in superannuation because it would be of lasting benefit to the work force of this country and of lasting benefit to the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course I did not hear any employers in those days, Senator Panizza&mdash;and I negotiated with quite a lot of them&mdash;saying to us, `We don't want you to have the three per cent superannuation. We want to give you the three per cent wages instead.' No-one was running up to the commission from the employer ranks and saying, `We want to give a three per cent wage increase.' You know that is the case because you know that, whether it was going to be delivered in terms of superannuation or wage increases, you and your supporters in the employer ranks and the employer organisations in this country would have opposed it, as they have opposed every single national wage increase since then, with the exception of one. We used to have to go in there and argue against incapacity to pay cases time and again in order to obtain superannuation entitlements or national wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Do not stand up here and lecture us about deferred wage increases. If you had your way, every single national wage increase would be deferred forever. Had this been delivered as a wage increase, what would have happened to that three per cent? Anywhere between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of it would have gone in tax, so it actually assisted&mdash;by your own strange logic&mdash;in reducing the tax burden at the time, and it has gone on doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You make a fundamental mistake in your remarks, as Senator Short does. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has pointed this out. You cannot logically include compulsory superannuation contributions in these calculations when you look at the proportion of income that goes in tax because, as Senator Sherry pointed out in that brilliant half-hour analysis of the tax system in this country, which could have gone on for at least an hour&mdash;it is unfortunate that his address was not broadcast at the time&mdash;the contributions are paid by the employer. Originally it was a three per cent contribution; it has now moved to either four or five per cent, depending on the level of salary in the particular workplace, and it will increase eventually to nine per cent. But it does not come out of the employee's income as tax. It is a contribution paid by the employer. In addition, it was recognised that, for employers that were already paying that contribution or more, they were not going to be required to pay it on top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the recent announcements, employees will, I acknowledge, be expected to contribute up to three per cent of their own income over time towards their superannuation entitlements, and the government will match those contributions. But you cannot class the employees' own contributions as income tax. They have never been classed as that in the history of this country, whether they were paid by agreement of the employee into a private superannuation fund or whether they were paid under legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do we get from you? You argue across the chamber here with Senator Sherry that, because the tax office will collect this three per cent if some employers do not pay it, it is a tax. That is there as a safety net, a guarantee. It is there to ensure that the contributions will be paid, with the tax office acting as a collection agency for it. It will only be applied to those employers who fail to meet their obligations under the award and under the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short, in his speech, said that people will not benefit from this until the year 2040, or words to that effect. That is absolute nonsense. There are many workers now who, since the introduction of superannuation back in the 1980s, have already built decent entitlements in those superannuation funds. That is an entitlement they would not have had if you and your lot had managed to hang on to government back in 1983. </PARA>

Wasn't it such a surprise when we actually saw the government's predictions in relation to the amount collected from FBT doubling and trebling in reality because of this tax minimisation that had been going on, particularly for people at the very high end of the wages and salaries spectrum?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I have not heard so much hypocrisy here than I have heard from the opposition this afternoon. As I said, when we look at tax and income tax rates the figures speak for themselves. As the Treasurer said, it is very clear that we are one of the lowest income tax countries in the world. In addition to that we have some of the world's best policies in terms of social security, education and training opportunities, and superannuation and retirement incomes. I remind the Senate that it was this government which stopped the tax avoidance industry, which was, as I said, the only industry that was going forward at the time the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer of this country. It is something I am sure is never likely to happen again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So badly have I succumbed to the Canberra flu that I was not going to proceed with involvement in this debate. But, as I lay on my office sofa an hour or so ago, what happened? Up on the screen came Senator Sherry with half an hour of absolute rambling nonsense. It made me so angry that any thoughts of withdrawing from this debate quickly dissipated and I just had to come down to show what falsehoods Senator Sherry has purported this afternoon in this debate on the motion of my colleague Senator Short relating to the quite accurate findings of a study by Access Economics regarding the fact that over the last decade&mdash;a decade that the government claims has been one of tax reform&mdash;average income earners in Australia have paid a higher proportion of their income in tax than they previously did. That is the simple fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is that a fact; the other fact is that, contrary to the government's continuing claims, Australians are not at the low tax end of residents of OECD countries. They are, as the Access Economics report shows, in the middle to higher range of that when we take into account all of the matters that ought to be taken into account in any comparative assessment of taxation rates. In other words, when we are comparing apples with apples we are a high tax country by comparison with our OECD compatriots, and even more so when we look at our near neighbours&mdash;those countries with whom we are competing and trading in this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this government simply does not want to listen to that advice. It is not the first time that this sort of study has been done to provide these facts to the government. Earlier this year a report by the accountants Coopers and Lybrand reached exactly the same conclusion&mdash;that we are in fact now paying a higher rate of tax than we were when the so-called tax reform process started 10 years ago. I wish to simply refer to that report for a few moments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report clearly makes the point that people on average weekly earnings are now paying a higher proportion of their income in tax than they were 10 years ago. According to the Coopers and Lybrand report, in September 1983 a single male on average weekly ordinary time earnings would have paid $4,346 of his $18,824 salary in tax, or 23.08 per cent, but by August 1994 that same person would have been earning $34,310 and paying $8,167 in tax, or 23.8 per cent&mdash;a higher proportion of his income now than before the tax reform process began. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other major shortcomings of the Australian tax system relates to what Senator Sherry and Senator Forshaw said. They claimed that the government has cut back the top marginal tax rate from 60c in the dollar to 50c in the dollar. That may well be the case, but they ignore the fact that that top marginal rate cuts in at a much lower level of income than it does in comparable countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States, for example, the top marginal tax rate does not cut in until people are earning an income of $250,000, which is equivalent to about $A336,000. In Germany, the top marginal tax rate cuts in at 120,000 deutschmarks, which is about $A105,000. In Japan it cuts in at Y20 million, which is about $A272,000. Yet here in Australia the top marginal tax rate cuts in at a meagre $50,000. While the government may well claim that it has cut the top marginal rate, the fact is that it cuts in at a much lower income level. Therefore the overall tax burden, even at that income level, is much greater than it has been in the past. So, as that Coopers and Lybrand study of earlier this year shows, we are paying more tax now than we were 10 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a study done by Terry Larkin and Terry Dwyer in August of this year, as part of the Business Council of Australia 210 project on refocusing micro-economic reform. They reinforce in their study the evidence and the conclusions reached by the Access Economics study, which is the subject of this motion moved by Senator Short. In that study they made the point that the claim that by OECD standards Australia is a low taxed country with only the United States and Turkey taxing less as a share of GDP is one that cannot be taken seriously. We are saying in this debate that that claim is false. It does not include all of the items that ought to be included in the tax basket in determining what the real rate of tax is. What Larkin and Dwyer say is that, even if you accept for a moment the false claim that we are a low taxed country, our tax ought to be much lower than it is, particularly because of our demographic structure. We have a much more favourable demographic structure than many of the other countries in the OECD in terms of the capacity to raise revenue from individuals. Therefore, we ought to have a low tax structure, but we do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also make the point, which is the key to the Access Economics study, that in order to get a meaningful comparison you have to take into account what is provided publicly as against what is provided privately in some other countries. This is where we come to the issue of superannuation. The government continues to deny that the superannuation guarantee charge ought to be included in assessing the levels of taxation. It is included in a number of other countries because it is collected publicly and paid publicly. They argue that because here the ultimate benefit is paid through private schemes you should not include its collection as an item of tax. The simple fact is that it is providing an item that in some other countries is provided publicly. Therefore, if you are going to compare apples with apples, it ought to be included in any assessment of Australia's tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor that has to be considered is that it significantly reduces the disposable after tax income, because it is removed at the same time as income tax is removed from a person's income. So, quite clearly, it is fair and reasonable when comparing tax rates between countries to include that super guarantee charge within the tax structure. When you make that comparison, you reach the conclusion that by comparison with our OECD fellow member countries we are not at all a low taxed country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In support of the critique which Access Economics, and Mr Geoff Carmody in particular, gave of the present tax structure, reference was made to the 1985 draft white paper, which identified deficiencies in our tax structure which, a decade later, still have not been rectified. We have had 13 years of this Labor government and we have had 10 years of them having been made aware that we have a deficient tax system that is in need of reform. These deficiencies have yet to be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably fair to say that the tax burden people have experienced under this Labor government is so much a part of their daily lives, after being bashed around the hip-pocket by this government with year after year and election after election of broken promises with regard to taxation, that it becomes something of a ho-hum issue. There is a revolt out there in the community against this government's tax policies, particularly amongst small business, who, after all, provide 45 per cent of the jobs in this community. People have come to the conclusion that enough is enough as far as taxation is concerned. That is why they are listening to the sort of evidence that Mr Geoff Carmody, through the Access Economics study, is providing to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major points the Access Economics study makes is that, as I said a few moments ago, comparisons with other OECD countries which put Australia in the low tax category ignore the impact on taxation levels of compulsory superannuation. Also, the tax cuts which have been realised over that period&mdash;I emphasise `have been realised' as distinguished from the l-a-w tax cuts, which were never realised and will never be realised&mdash;generated no net gains for ordinary Australians. So even where there has been some tax reform, limited as it may be, there has been no gain for ordinary Australians. In fact, it is only for those on higher taxable incomes that the amount of average income tax plus superannuation guarantee charge is actually lower in 1994-95 than it was in 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rich have got richer under this government's tax policies. It is the high income earners that have benefited from the changes made to our tax structure, rather than the low and average income earners in our community. This has occurred despite the warnings given in that 1985 draft white paper that if nothing was done the result would be not an acceptable outcome. That forecast was realised in 1987-88 and exceeded in 1988-89, some six years ago. Yet very little has been done to change that unsatisfactory tax structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also heard comment from Senator Sherry with regard to the fringe benefits tax and what a marvellous tax reform the introduction of the fringe benefits tax was, but even there the government has mucked up because the way in which the government has applied the fringe benefits tax, which certainly does have legitimacy and does have its place in a proper tax structure, is flawed in the extreme. For employees earning less than $50,000 a year, an FBT rate of 48.4 per cent combined with the grossing up aspect is far too high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is, of course, that there is no benefit now in an employer providing fringe benefits to an employee who earns less than that because the cost through fringe benefits tax is greater than through the ordinary income tax rate being applied if those benefits are cashed out and paid to the employee as normal cash wages. Because of that, that is exactly what is happening. Fringe benefits are in fact being cashed out and paid as part of normal wages and salaries. To that extent, fringe benefits are being removed from employees with an income of less than $50,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, we see massive increases in the revenue being earned from the fringe benefits tax, which means that legitimate business expenses and legitimate facilities being provided for employees to undertake their work requirements are being taxed as a fringe benefit. That is quite the contrary of a legitimate fringe benefits tax scheme. Yet the government refuses to recognise that. It refuses to recognise that applying the fringe benefits tax to legitimate business expenses is a clear violation of income tax principles. We heard Senator Sherry in here defending the way his government is administering the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried to point out to the government time and time again their violation of the income tax principles but, as I said, they just do not want to listen. They have attacked this Access Economics report quite erroneously and quite illegitimately. In the 10 years since the release of the government's 1985 draft white paper, we have seen a highly regulated tax regime develop under this government which is complex, and the burden of the cost of compliance has affected businesses severely and detrimentally. Therefore, of course, our entire economy has been detrimentally affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Tax Research Foundation study found that personal income taxpayers faced a compliance cost equivalent to 9.3 per cent of tax revenue. This compared with compliance costs in Canada of 2.5 per cent; in the United Kingdom of 3.6 per cent; and in the USA of five to seven per cent. For 96 per cent of Australian companies, compliance costs exceeded the amount remitted in income tax. What nonsense that is! What sort of tax structure and tax administration must we have in this country when, for 96 per cent of Australian companies, compliance costs exceed the amount of money remitted in income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to the fringe benefits tax issue&mdash;and nowhere is this tax issue more relevant than in relation to fringe benefits. This area has become a huge source of revenue for the government but, as I said, it is a largely illegitimate source of revenue. When it was legitimate, it forced businesses to cash out those benefits&mdash;now it is taxing legitimate business expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated revenue in 1995-96 from the fringe benefits tax is in excess of $2.8 billion. Compliance costs are estimated to be 10.6 per cent or $300 million for this financial year. That is a remarkable contrast to the revenue of $535 million when the fringe benefits tax was first introduced nine years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the then Treasurer and current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the initiation of a tax simplification study to examine the complexities of the tax system. We have never seen that study, and we might well ask what has happened to it. Is this another one of the broken promises made by the former Treasurer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax complexity and the administrative burden placed on businesses in order to comply raise business costs, and this government persists in failing to do anything about it. Of course, those higher costs mean lower competitiveness, lower job growth and, therefore, fewer jobs and higher prices. So, again, the whole nation loses out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse still is that the government attempted to hoodwink businesses in order to win the 1993 election. The government announced and delivered a tax rate of 33c, but only two years later this was reneged upon and the tax rate was again increased to 36c. The government's election promise was made under the guise of aligning our company tax rates with those of our trading competitors in the Asian region. It is worth noting that in Singapore, the company tax rate is 27c; in Thailand, it is 30c; and, in Malaysia, it is 34c. Yet here companies are faced with a company tax rate of 36c in the dollar. By combining that with the introduction of quarterly tax instalments, the effect will be an increase in collections to a level higher than when the company tax rate was 39c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's claim that Australians are better off as far as tax is concerned is quite clearly false. The study undertaken by Access Economics, which reinforces earlier work done by Coopers and Lybrand and Larkin and Dwyer, clearly shows that we are a high taxed country in comparison with our OECD partners. Even more so, Australia is a high taxed country when compared to the countries I mentioned a few moments ago in relation to not only company tax but also personal income tax. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong have rates around 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry said that they have a social security system that is much worse than ours. They have a culture where families look after their own. They have the resources to look after their own because it is not all ripped off them in tax. People are left with more of their own resources, therefore they can fulfil their responsibilities in those areas. Because of their low tax rates, countries like Singapore and Hong Kong have generated much stronger economic growth and they actually have higher average weekly earnings than we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are better off. They have lower tax and they can look after their own families when they are in need. They do not have this churning process where money is ripped off them in tax and given back to them by the government after a lot of it sticks to the government's fingers due to administrative costs. What we need in this country is genuine reform. We need to get the tax rates down significantly lower than they are now. It will not happen under this government, but it certainly will happen when we have a change of government after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten years ago the Hawke-Keating government claimed a new era for taxation policy in Australia. A much publicised tax summit was held to listen to all sections of the community. I wish to hell the Prime Minister had done something about some of the things that were being recommended at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Short says in his motion, the aim of then Treasurer Keating was to relieve the tax burden from middle Australia. Other speakers have pointed out just how badly off middle Australia is at the moment. The Labor government's income tax policies have only benefited the high income earners on about 2 1/2 times the average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One group that Mr Keating has forgotten about entirely is the rural sector. While he lauds a drought policy that he claims is the most innovative and far reaching of any in recent history, the fact remains that rural Australia, if it were ever middle Australia, is now well and truly in the low income bracket, driven there by high taxes and inappropriate government policies that have prevented them being able to survive adverse weather and market conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax collection has been the shining glory of the taxing Hawke and Keating governments&mdash;the one crowning achievement in a litany of failures. I should not need to remind the Senate that the government that promised tax relief for middle Australia has increased sales tax from $3.4 billion in 1982 to $14.1 billion in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the most recent budget, sales tax was once again lifted by one per cent across the whole range of goods that attract sales tax. Some, like the tax on recycled paper, were added for good measure. The Labor Party wanted to slug the building industry through a tax on building materials and were only stopped by the coalition. This is indicative of the insensitivity of this out of touch of government. Total individual tax has been estimated to have increased 136 per cent since 1983, company tax a massive 370 per cent and indirect tax 149 per cent. Tax increases are set to outstrip the rate of inflation by an average of 9.8 per cent per annum over the 13 long years the Labor Party has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of collecting the tax is also amongst the highest in the world. In 1994 the cost of collecting tax was about $1.1 billion and it involved a permanent staff of something like 18,000 people. The tax legislation is now spread over 2,000 pages and requires frequent updates for accountants so that they can keep up with the myriad of changes&mdash;and this from a government that promised a simplified tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have they done with petrol, the lifeblood of middle Australia? For a start, they put an extra tax on leaded fuel. But at the same time, as was pointed out in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> article headed `ALP's petrol tax hits the true believers':</PARA>

But for all the tax collections they got from fuel the money certainly did not go on roads. Of $9.7 billion that the government collected from petrol excise last year, only $820 million was allocated to federal road funding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My particular area of concern is for rural Australians. Everyone says, `Okay, but they're not making enough income to be paying tax.' However, the point is that when people in country areas travel in motorcars, they have to pay the fuel taxes, they have pay the wholesale taxes. Every time there is transport on or off a farm, or to a country town or city, or away from a country town or city, there are the wholesale taxes on the cost of transport. There are the fringe benefits taxes, which have already been mentioned by other speakers here tonight. Then of course you have a capital gains tax. The poor old farmer who has actually bought a farm since 1985 will be slugged with a capital gains tax. If he leaves the property to his sons and they sell it at some stage down the track, even if the property was bought 100 years ago, they will be paying a capital gains tax.

We are highly taxed. The government has no commitment, concern or worry about where we are going in the future. Farm profitability is not great.

As it is at present, with scaffolding and fencing around it, it really does detract from the parliamentary building down there. The sooner it is restored, the sooner the parliamentary triangle will look less like a work site and more like it ought to look.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Regulation of Computer On-Line Services: Part 1</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in the Senate last Tuesday. The report deals with what used to be called bulletin board services or what are now called on-line services. The fact of the change of the name is one indication of a field that is changing with incredible speed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has in its title `part 1'. The reason for this is that we are developing in our country a huge problem on the dark side of the information superhighway, which is going to develop very rapidly over the rest of this decade. The committee is proposing at this stage to keep a watching brief on what is happening. So this report is only part 1 of what we see as a series. Indeed, the committee agreed in the last week or so to move to part 2, which will be a more wide-ranging inquiry than the subject of this report, which is a one-day seminar we held in Canberra to inform the committee on the various issues that are coming out of the development of on-line services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development is an offshoot of the Internet and it is something which, broadly, has tremendous benefits for the future development of our society. You will find with many of these on-line services that there are things such as parent interest groups for ailing children with leukaemia. There are historical societies or common groups who want to look at countries such as Ireland and share their common cultural heritage. There are poetry clubs. There are information exchanges on a whole range of various interest groups. There is product information. There is also the possibility of the selling of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted that, on radio this morning, the Labor Party have a page on this on-line service. They thought this was a marvellous thing. Of course, the Liberal Party also have a site on the Internet and people can access that as well. So there are all sorts of interesting things that are available on the Internet. These are good for community and for commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of services are growing incredibly rapidly. There are 50 million users worldwide of Internet services at the moment&mdash;750,000 people in Australia, which is the fourth highest in the world. There is an ability to move across the world at the speed of light with these services, jumping from site to site. The rate of growth of home pages&mdash;that is, people who are actually locating themselves, their organisation or their particular service on the Internet&mdash;is growing at 20 per cent a month. Let me repeat that: 20 per cent a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is an exploding situation and one that has enormous implications for our society. People can access a very wide range of information&mdash;calling down whole libraries of information from around the world. Entertainment and movies are possible through this medium. You can study for a degree in Boston. You can extend the range of educational services. Even the simple, humble letter becomes so much more accessible on services like the E-mail. All this is absolutely terrific, and this is the light side of the net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a dark side of the Internet. On the same online services you can find hard core pornography that is far worse than anything you can find in a sex shop. I am sure senators will remember the case from the newspapers that dealt with instructions on how to conduct a rape. There are lessons on how to construct bombs. Paedophilia rings have sprung up. There was a case at the University of Birmingham, which was the main source of this information, and there were arrests there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these things that I have just mentioned are illegal activities in our society. However, we have this new medium which puts a whole new dimension on this old range of activities. One of the great problems that we face is that the sources are not necessarily in Australia. It is a world-wide problem. Children sitting in their bedrooms can access material out of the centre of China, Russia, the United States or the Bahamas. There is an international casino out of the Bahamas where people can use their credit cards to gamble away as much money as they like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are moving into a totally new era of international commerce where the old boundaries are not applicable any more. Geoffrey Huston, Secretary of the Internet Society of Virginia USA, spoke at a Canberra seminar about the problem of much of the material from overseas. He warned about the inadequacy of Australia's regulatory framework to control this problem. The sinister misuse of Internet resources was reported by Reuters newsagency on 13 September 1995 where professor Harold Thimbley, a computer expert, likened the Internet to an electronic red district distributing violent pornography and helping the organisation of paedophile rings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As legislators we have to grapple with this issue. It is probably one of the most difficult issues we will ever have to grapple with because of our lack of control over what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Community Standards Committee first came across this problem when we were looking into video games. We spoke to children at high school and we started to learn about how they were accessing material from the Internet. We learned of the difficulties that it was creating for parents in the supervision of that sort of activity. The committee decided to have a closer look at this matter this year and, in particular, to look at what governments are doing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a federal-state effort and the Attorneys-General came up with an options paper in August last year which set out five options: the first was to do nothing; the second was to apply the full classification system of the OFLC; the third was to develop and adopt the guidelines of the online services community; the fourth was partial classification on bulletin boards; and the fifth option was an extension of that classification to include legal obligations to take reasonable steps with restricted category material under the OFLC level of classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seemed to be the preferable option and that is the way that the government initially seemed to be going. Unfortunately, when they brought down their next report in July 1995, following considerable criticism from the industry which basically wanted to be left alone, they came down more on a self-regulatory proposal with some educational back-up and with some legal sanctions which one would suspect are already there through the criminal code. It is incredibly difficult to undertake any effective education that will stop children accessing and looking at this material. Legal sanctions are very difficult to enforce. We also have this self-regulatory scheme which is an extension of the OFLC's other work on film and video. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a different area. We are in an area that is far more complex and difficult to control than videos and film. The committee is having some doubts about the likely effectiveness of the government's approach. That is why we have decided to have a wider inquiry&mdash;to try to find out in particular what international controls can be put in place. The United States&mdash;the site of a lot of this material&mdash;has already moved a lot further than Australia in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the possibility of technological controls. There are ways of putting systems into computer software which screen out words and certain material. We need a combination of those things. We need education; we need technological controls over the material; we need international regulations. I believe what we need is probably a much stronger code. I would advocate to the government at this point that it should go back to its original option and try to come up with a tougher system. We will be observing what governments do over the next few years. We will bring forward to this Senate further recommendations on what they should do with the dark side of the net. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to report to the Senate on my protest against French nuclear testing in Mururoa and my consequent arrest by the French authorities on that atoll. I want to say right at the outset that I consider myself to have been very fortunate to be the federal parliamentarian who was chosen by Greenpeace to be able to take my protest into the 12-mile zone at Mururoa and onto the atoll. There are a large number of parliamentarians in Australia who would have been very happy to do exactly the same thing that I did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best things that came out of all this was the enormous unity across this country from parliamentarians of all political parties against the actions of the French in Mururoa. I would particularly like to mention the member for Adelaide, Trish Worth, who guaranteed to the organising committee for the protest at Papeete that there would be bipartisan support. She has held to that agreement all the way through. She has been able to get strong support and acquiescence from her leader and also from the spokesman for foreign affairs. That has to be appreciated by all of the people who are involved in the protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also particularly grateful to Greenpeace. It was only their organisation and the resources which they were able to put at our disposal which allowed the nine parliamentarians to board the transfer vessel in Papeete and make the four-day trip to the 12-mile zone around Mururoa and to eventually board the vessel in which we were able to penetrate the 12-mile zone and make our protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like tonight to briefly set the record straight on some of the lies which the French have been telling about our mission and protest. It was not true that, at the time we were arrested, the eight parliamentarians&mdash;the two Australians, two Italians, the Japanese, the Luxembourger and the lady from Sweden&mdash;were in any way sick. We were in extremely good spirits and health. We had been through a very difficult and arduous voyage to get to Mururoa. We had spent four days sailing just to get to the 12-mile zone. Once we got there, we had to endure a force 10 gale for 12 hours before conditions moderated sufficiently for us to transfer to another boat and get into the 12-mile zone. But, at the time we were picked up, we were all in extremely good health and spirits. It is just a function of the French propaganda machine to suggest that we were in any other state or that they in any other way rescued us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not appreciate after our interrogation that the purpose for their taking us to a military hospital was purely propaganda. We believed at the time that it was a convenient place to put us under guard and store us for the night. Again, I have to nail a lie there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also not true, as the French authorities have tried to pretend, that the parliamentarians were not charged. What really happened is that, once we were transferred to Mururoa atoll by the French frigate, we were taken immediately to the central military police station, where we were interrogated for about five hours. We were each given statements to sign in which we admitted that we had broken French law and various other things. For my part, I certainly signed my statement because there was absolutely no point in denying that the very purpose I had gone to Mururoa was to break the 12-mile zone. I could not see any point in arguing about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, at the same time as the French seek to say that no legal action is being taken against us, the French ambassador to Italy has said about my two Italian colleagues on that boat that, first of all, they put themselves in great physical danger and, secondly, that they put themselves in great legal danger. It is the case that the Italian press is now running a story that the court case will be brought on in about a month. Both versions of the events cannot be true. I put it to the Senate that it is the French propaganda machine which is spreading these stories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another untruth was told to me by Colonel Gallandt, who is in charge of the French legionnaires that form the main military presence at Mururoa. He said to me and the journalists who were present while we were at the atoll that the two Greenpeace activists who preceded us into the 12-mile zone by a matter of a couple of days were sitting next to him at the time of the first test observing the event. The truth of the matter is that they were both in separate gaol cells. They had not been told that the test was about to occur, which meant that they were thrown from their beds in the gaol cells with the seismic reaction that followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also not true, as the French would have the world believe, that Greenpeace is about to fold and that it is incapable of continuing its very effective protest at the 12-mile zone. Greenpeace had another four boats join the peace flotilla while we were at the atoll. They now have in place their supply lines, which will enable them to continue the protest for as long as the French insist upon this madness of nuclear testing. The world owes Greenpeace a considerable degree of gratitude for the resources, time and bravery that they have demonstrated in maintaining this protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if there was a danger to the parliamentarians, it really came at the hands of the French themselves. They chose to transfer us from the boat upon which we were arrested and seized to the French warship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tapageuse</EMPHASIS> in extremely rough seas. It is an absolute miracle that nobody was hurt in the transfer between those two vessels. Inflatable craft like Zodiacs move very quickly in a heavy sea. They can move, as I observed, 10 metres at the drop of a hat when people are trying to grab on to rope ladders and so on to get aboard a mother ship. That was the real risk as far as the parliamentarians were concerned. The French are lucky that no-one was really hurt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, many very positive outcomes have come from the action which I was privileged to participate in. I have said elsewhere, and I will say it again, that I believe the government is doing all it can in the normal diplomatic international channels to press the case against the French. What we were able to do as parliamentarians demonstrates that there is still scope for personal action. It is still possible for parliamentarians, particularly given their position and status within the domestic and international communities, to take personal actions which make a difference and go beyond the power of any individual country, however small or large it may be. In that respect, it was particularly significant that two Japanese parliamentarians were prepared to come into the 12-mile zone with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am aware, it has never been the case that Japanese parliamentarians have participated in a protest like this outside Japan. I think it is significant for all the countries of the Pacific who lack the enormous economic power of the Japanese. I am particularly grateful to my Japanese colleagues. It is also a first for Greenpeace to facilitate a protest like this by parliamentarians. I emphasise that Greenpeace put no preconditions whatever on our participation and had no role whatever in the joint statements that we made. We were free to carry on our project as we saw fit. Again, I think that was a worthwhile thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our protest and as a result of the very hard work put in by other parliamentarians who went to Papeete, an international organisation of parliamentarians for a nuclear free world will be formed. I think that sort of cooperation is an important thing in this world. It shows that, despite the things which may bitterly divide us in this place and in other parliaments around the world, we can come together on something which is clearly for the benefit of future generations and beyond the normal forms of ideological argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think that the protest which we were able to mount was a useful signal, if not to the pigheadedness of the Chirac government, at least to other countries around the world&mdash;China, India, Pakistan, Iraq and other countries which are thought to be possessing nuclear weapons and may seek to test them. I think it has been made very clear by the international condemnation that that sort of activity is absolutely unacceptable. I believe we are having a great impact upon the French, nevertheless. I saw President Jacques Chirac on French television once I returned to Papeete. He spent 15 minutes of his interview criticising the Australian and the New Zealand actions in the South Pacific. Given our relative size to France and given that he seeks to talk about France as an imperial and world power, it must be clear that for him to spend so much time criticising us, we must be doing something right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say in closing that what we have been able to demonstrate is that a new principle is about in leadership in the world. These days people are looking for leadership in the form of ideas and in the form of determination to see those ideas through for the benefit of the people that parliamentarians represent. They are not looking for leadership by force and they are not looking for leadership by aggression, which is what the French are demonstrating. I believe they will continue to be criticised for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;North Forest Products has announced with great fanfare that it is seeking a licence to export an extra 450,000 tonnes of woodchips annually from northern Tasmania. No doubt realising the very high level of community opposition to mining our native forests for woodchips, North Forest Products has tried to legitimise the application with a number of claims asserting that the proposal is good for the economy. The Australian Democrats are dismayed at this application and we oppose it for economic as well as environmental reasons. North Forest Products is claiming that the proposal will signal a massive boost for the Burnie region in the form of $40 million of new investment and 450 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few days ago the World Bank announced that each Australian is a millionaire. This is a figure which is derived from the estimated total value&mdash;the capital value&mdash;of our resources. It is the value of the farm which some would want to sell. It is precisely because our forests have intrinsic economic value that we need to be very careful in our assessment as to whether the claim to $27 million in annual economic benefit to be derived from the conversion of native forest trees to newsprint is economically sensible. In making such an assessment, we must ensure that we factor in the timber value&mdash;both current and forgone&mdash;of the myrtle and other minor species furniture timbers that will inevitably be chipped if the practices of the present are followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked questions about the mechanisms in place which monitor the quality of the timber sent to the chipper. The answer has given me no confidence that the kind of practices that I have photographic evidence about are not standard practice. A letter I received only a couple of days ago from a small sawmill in Tasmania again raises complaints about the prevalence of pulping valuable timber. This is timber which could be used in Queensland tourist developments, for example, to replace timber that is currently being imported from Germany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to ensure that the financing costs are properly included in the assessment. Strange as it may sound, it seems that we really do not know the true net income from woodchipping. Some time ago in this place, I asked the minister some questions about this in the hope that he would be able to demonstrate that in economic terms the costs and benefits of woodchip exports have really been properly analysed. I asked the minister what was the total value of capital equipment imported and used in the export woodchipping industry. The answer was that we don't even compile the data. I also asked the cost of overseas borrowing to finance the purchase of capital equipment used in the industry. That data is not collected either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, no-one has thought it necessary to analyse the cost to the nation of the imported log trucks and equipment used, against the income derived. Yet we are constantly told by the industry, by such companies as North Forest Products, that woodchipping has an economic benefit. In this case we are fed the precise figure of $27 million, but nobody knows how to calculate it. According to North's proposal the plan is to clearfell&mdash;how much land is not stated&mdash;but enough on which to plant 5.5 million trees each year on its freehold land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two questions to be considered here. Irrespective of the fact that the trees are owned by the company, is the claimed annual income of $27 million enough for the resource which will be used? Or are our forests still one of the five great giveaways referred to so colourfully by my predecessor Senator Sanders in his first speech as the first environmentalist elected to an Australian parliament? Furthermore, is this income enough to offset the environmental costs to the community of water run-off problems, loss of species habitat, and the forgone value to tourism and other nature based activities, not to mention other non-wood forest products?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The longer term objective of North Forest Products' proposal is to replace native forest with a massive plantation producing wood fibre for a `world class' pulp mill. Such a proposal is insane. The economic logic of plantations to produce pulp is based on concepts of industrial forestry; of planting single species, single aged blocks of trees for mechanical clearfelling and extraction. This would ignore the emerging facts that such operations are in no way consistent with principles of ecological sustainability. They are not even economically sustainable, because successive crops tend to produce reducing yields. Industrial forestry is merely an extension of conveyor belt mechanisation. There certainly can be no guarantee of long-term employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will know that I have kept a close eye on the National Registration Authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals, and the use of chemicals more generally. It is ironic that one of the chemicals selected by the National Registration Authority for review this year is atrazine. This has occurred precisely because a significant number of people in Tasmania have been adversely affected by atrazine run-off and they have told the National Registration Authority about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As senators may know, atrazine is used in industrial forestry plantations to control weeds. But when it leaches into the creeks that provide drinking water for milk producing cattle, for example, we have to ask whether this is the inevitable end result of following the simple economic imperative of engaging in industrial wood fibre production to feed `world class' pulp mills; of government representatives being so intimidated by big companies and big log trucks that they dutifully grant export woodchip licences and, if so, whether the loss of exports of agricultural produce has been considered in the economic equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But why does Tasmania need or want to be locked into a so-called `world class pulp mill' anyway? The logic of such a development is that once the mill is established, Tasmania is locked into providing the feedstock for the life of the mill. More trees are needed. Not just plantation trees, but inevitably as plantations fail from disease or overcropping or any of the other typical problems of monoculture, I predict that the mill owners will threaten that unless a new source of native forest trees is provided, jobs will be lost. That is the typical threat, that is the one I predict and I guarantee that it will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is that the future we want, a future of pine, plastic, pulp and plantations, as put a couple of years ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wilderness News</EMPHASIS> by a couple of members of Greening Australia&mdash;a future dependent upon the needs and demands of so-called world-class mills? We need to stand up for ourselves&mdash;to refuse to play the world-class game. In this country we have unique resources in our native forests. They should be protected, nurtured and valued as perpetual and necessary inputs to the life of our planet. To cut them down to be replaced with plantations of any type is sacrilege, and it is about time this government recognised it as such. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra has advised that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) By comparing prices available at the time on Purchasing Australia and State Government contracts, reviewing individual rental agreements to identify any free products that did not provide value to Telstra and calculating the extra financing associated with the extended rental period.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) Repayment rates varied from deal to deal based on the type of equipment purchased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) Rental periods varied from three to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Yes. Price comparisons were made in order to determine the level of `exploitative' pricing charged. Prices charged varied depending on the range of bundled or free product. On those products where `exploitative' pricing occurred, the price charged was, on average, 6% above that available on Purchasing Australia contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There were no Telstra contracts in place with any photocopier or facsimile supplier. Any `exploitative' arrangements were applied on individual rental agreements. Two hundred and three staff were identified as signing the individual agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) Mr Mauro was never employed by Telstra as a member of its staff.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The `exploitative' lease arrangements were similar to those identified in Victoria but not as extensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Victorian and New South Wales matters were handled together. No matters were identified in NSW that needed referring to the police.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) No. The Group Managing Director, Network and Technology Group of Telstra, as delegate, approved non exclusive Product Sourcing Agreements with Canon Australia and Fuji Xerox Australia on 14 October 1993. Whilst the arrangements with the companies are non exclusive Telstra's Executive Council issued a mandate in July 1993 that purchase of photocopier and facsimile machines must be made through a Telstra contract. The objective of the arrangement was to improve the standard of the purchasing process and achieve substantial cost savings for Telstra. In October 1994 Telstra's Executive Council issued a further mandate to cover all national sourcing contracts for commercially available products and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Refer to the response to part 3(b) of this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11)(a),(b) and (c). In order to evaluate tender responses machines were divided into eleven categories based on rated monthly output capabilities and similarly optioned to ensure a true comparison. In six categories there were instances where other companies offered comparable machines at lower prices (these included machines from such companies as Lanier, Mita, Alcatel Datakey, Remington, Konica and Inchcape). Percentage variations between the lowest price and the selected supplier where in the range 0.3% to 14.6%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assessing which tenderers offered the best value for money, Telstra's objectives included minimising the total number of suppliers, in order to:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the total range of products and configurations available from each tenderer was a key element in the selection criteria. Canon Australia and Fuji Xerox Australia were able to offer the full range of machines required and were assessed as being at the leading edge of the technology.  They also had extensive maintenance strengths including their own employees, proven distribution networks and are considered market leaders across this range of products. None of the lower priced tenderers were considered able to match Canon Australia or Fuji Xerox Australia in any of these aspects. Final contract prices received from Fuji Xerox Australia and Canon Australia reduced the percentage variance shown above.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Department of Defence regularly discusses the availability of Harpoon missiles with the US Department of Defense. At the time of the Pentagon press release, an offer for a life of type buy made by the US Department of Defense was being considered by the ADF. This offer was made after an earlier proposal for the supply of Harpoon missiles was not taken up and had expired in May 1995. That earlier offer had been made in response to a request for price and availability information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australian officials involved in negotiations to purchase Harpoon missiles were from the Navy Materiel Division and the Australian Embassy, Washington D.C.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) If a sale were to be made US Congressional clearance of the sale would be necessary because of the size of the Harpoon offer. This clearance was routinely sought by the US Navy International Programs Office to enable the offer to be taken up by the ADF, if desired, before it expired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There was no misunderstanding over ADF intentions between the US and Australian officials directly involved. The offer remained open for the ADF to accept or decline until the end of August 1995. The Pentagon press release following US Congressional clearance presumed that the offer would be accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Those officials directly involved on both sides understand that, of approximately 250 formal requests for pricing and advice on releasibility lodged annually by the Australian Embassy in Washington, only about 140 result in Government to Government contracts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Human Services and Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Home and Community Care (HACC) Program is jointly funded by the Commonwealth and State/Territory governments, with Commonwealth providing about 60% of the funding. The Commonwealth shares responsibility for planning, community consultation, accountability and resource allocation arrangements. However, responsibility for day-to-day management of the Program rests with State/Territory governments who are the primary point of contact with service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HACC funded Specific Home Care (SHC) are auspiced in Victoria, mainly by local governments. It is recognised that there may be variation in the distribution of SHC services across local government areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a standard set of operational guidelines apply across the Program in the State, variations in administration in an area may occur as a result of differences in demography, needs-based planning, local government priorities and priority of access to services based on the relative need of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The provision of services through SHC is based on the assessed relative needs of clients. Any limitations on service provision are therefore linked to prioritised level of need and the service's ability to meet these needs within resources available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HACC Program was established to provide basic maintenance and support services for frail aged and other people with a disability, and their carers. Overnight in-home respite care is a resource-intensive service which many services find difficult to provide because of the cost and the need for workers to have special qualifications for administering medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HACC services providing respite care are encouraged to respond flexibly in meeting client needs, including accompanying a person with a disability to recreational or development activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service providers are encouraged to arrange for a consumer to have services delivered by the same person whenever possible. This is not always possible due to the hours individual staff members are employed, the time of demand and rostering difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) HACC National Guidelines set broad parameters for the operation of the Program nationally. Each State/Territory is responsible for developing guidelines for the Program in their State/Territory. In Victoria guidelines have been developed for each service type which provide a basis for consistent service provision and outcomes for clients. Service providers are required to comply with these guidelines in the provision of care and with the National Service Standards which set national guidelines for consistency in service quality and provision to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The HACC Program provides a subsidy for the provision of SHC services. Where a local government charges a fee, it is expected that this fee will be used for the extension and expansion of the service. Where fees are charged by an organisation, they should be sought only from consumers who have the capacity to pay and waived for any service where the client is assessed as not having that capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Under current program arrangements all HACC funded services are required to enter into an agreement specifying service delivery details with the State/Territory administering departments. These services are also required to submit an annual audited statement of expenditure to the State/Territory department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of State/Territory administrative responsibility is on-going monitoring and the regular conduct of services reviews to ensure compliance with the service agreement and HACC Service Standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A joint Commonwealth/State review of the Program has recently been completed and the Health and Community Services Ministerial Council has agreed to its recommendations with some minor amendments. One of the areas of reform flowing from the review will be a move to funding services for the care provided to HACC consumers, rather than for service inputs, such as salaries and administrative costs. Consequent to this move will be the implementation of accountability measures that will report program outputs on a regional basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This refocusing of the Program's funding on outputs and outcomes for clients and the associated accountability measures, will ensure that Commonwealth funds are focused on outcomes for all HACC services including Specific Home Care services in Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The primary aim of casemix funding is to improve the efficiency of hospitals. Casemix information will assist in tasks associated with measuring quality, but cannot, of itself, change the quality of health services. As the States progressively implement casemix measures it will be possible to assess the impact on quality and efficiency, though allowance must be made for concurrent changes in health services delivery. An assessment of the implementation of casemix in Victoria in 1993-94 found considerable efficiency gains and no decline in quality attributable to the casemix funding system. An assessment of the introduction of casemix in South Australia in 1994-95 will be undertaken by the Commonwealth late 1996. Many hospital clinicians are using casemix information, among other measures, in order to assist in improving their approach to patient care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is working with the States to develop nationally consistent measures that will permit a better assessment of changes in quality over time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Under the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995, the definition of "minerals" for the purposes of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme has been clarified to specifically exclude sand, sandstone, soil, slate, clay (other than bentonite or kaolin), basalt, granite, gravel, limestone or water. The amended definition currently applies to diesel fuel purchased on or after 1 August 1986. The Government has already introduced the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 to amend the operative date to 1 July 1995 (except in relation to water), to accord with the will of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amended definition of "minerals", diesel fuel purchased for use to extract limestone per se is not rebatable as limestone is not recognised as a mineral in its own right.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACS did not change its position in respect of the eligibility for rebate of diesel fuel used in the extraction of limestone on that day.
