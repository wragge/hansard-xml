<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Ray, the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, and it is to the background of Labor's television fear campaign in Western Australia. I ask: why should Australian workers believe the scare campaigns, when under your government they are now paying more taxes, despite your promise that there would be no new taxes; they missed out on the l-a-w tax cuts, despite the specific promise of that; pensioners are still paying tax, despite the promise that they would not be taxpayers by 1995; and first home buyers still do not have the use of their superannuation for a home deposit? Why doesn't Labor's litany of lies discount this or any future fear campaigns that you plan to run? Wouldn't your government be doing better by getting on with the job of government rather than running 12 months of fruitless fear campaigns?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the view of this government that the opposition cannot be trusted on industrial relations matters. For the evidence of that, Mr President, you only have to go back to their state counterparts, whom they apparently have no relationship with whatsoever. You only have to look at the campaign promises of Mr Kennett and then see what he translated that to in industrial relations legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett went very quiet on industrial relations before the state election in October 1992, and then he introduced some of the most draconian measures seen in this country in the last 20 or 30 years. That included individual work contracts; that included getting rid of holiday loading, et cetera. A lot of these issues eventually got knocked over in the court but, of course, that was by way of the appeal process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we saw happen in Victoria was over 370,000 people vote with their feet, leave the state awards and go under the federal award system&mdash;the protection of which was approved by this chamber in December 1992. It was a credit to the Senate that it provided these workers with an alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When does the next test come up? The Liberal Party mealy-mouthiness in an election campaign came up in Western Australia.

He calls it a scare campaign. We call it an information campaign. That is the dichotomy of politics, Mr President.

Those opposite, simply through their old class prejudices, seek to disrupt that. They seek to crawl to a constituency that does not even belong to them. The employers do not even believe them on this!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The launch last week of the Australian Food Council as the industry's peak representative body highlighted the opportunities and constraints facing Australia's food industry, particularly in the east-Asian region. What barriers exist in the region which affect the industry's capacity to realise its enormous growth potential and what is the government doing to assist industry overcome these?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2234" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Forshaw for the question because it is of direct relevance to a lot of workers in New South Wales and it is appropriate that he should raise it. Both I and my colleagues Senator Bob Collins and Senator Cook had the great pleasure of being involved last week with the launch of the Australian Food Council. We were very pleased about that because it provides the government with an excellent forum in which to discuss strategies and priorities in a very important area of trade growth. The council sets a very high priority on the important issue of market access, of how we can deliver more and greater market access outcomes for processed food. We are pleased to work with them on this as they have said they are looking forward to doing with us. We really have a very close match between the priorities of this industry group and the government in reducing tariffs, eliminating non-tariff barriers and getting unreasonable quarantine barriers out of the way of our processed food sector in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very welcome to the government&mdash;particularly to me as trade minister and, I know, to my colleagues&mdash;that this industry is part of Australia's largest manufacturing sector, which is becoming increasingly export oriented with exports growing by more than 45 per cent since the beginning of the decade. Those exports are now valued at more than $12 billion, an increase of $3 1/2 billion over the last four years&mdash;almost $1 billion a year. It is particularly valuable that the greatest increase in exports has been in the sector of the highly processed foods where the highest value is added. This is where the greatest value therefore is being contributed to the Australian economy and it is very much part of the focus on our east-Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten of our 15 largest markets for processed food are situated in east Asia. As incomes rise, we can expect to see an increase in the quantity of food being consumed and a shift towards more processed food, which we are particularly well placed to provide. Therefore, it is a sector of increased significance to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My department's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Subsistence to supermarket: food and agricultural transformation in South-East Asia</EMPHASIS>, which was released last year, forecast that the south-east Asian market for food and agricultural products could reach about $77 billion by 2010. By merely retaining our market share, the Australian food industry could increase its exports to South-East Asia alone by almost $5 billion over the 20 years to 2010. But maintaining our market share is not going to be an easy task. It sounds easy, but the market place is getting much more competitive. More and more people are coming into the market. Of course, as new participants come into the market, it gets harder. But our market share as against all the other non-south-east Asian players in this market is going up, and we need to continue to focus on that. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not going to be easy to maintain our market share but it is very important that we do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great opportunities out there but there are also great obstacles, as Senator Forshaw has outlined. The CEDA report highlighted those obstacles. We are trying through APEC and through our bilateral activities to focus on them. For example, we are hoping in the very short term to get a bit of a breakthrough in relation to New Zealand to keep open the market for our highly processed grain and our value added products which will be of value of Australia's manufacturers. To the members of the Australian Food Council, we welcome its formation and we look forward to working with them.</PARA>

<TITLE>Industrial Relations: Accord</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="2235" SPEAKER="Crane Sen A.W." NAMEID="UW4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. Just last week the President of the Master Builders Association warned that the Accord is failing in maintaining its objective of having two to three per cent inflation. He also accused your government's industrial relations policies of contributing to the boom-bust cycle in the building and construction industry because of the lack of a checks and balances framework in the industry. Isn't it the case that the Accord is failing in its major objectives of low inflation and protection of building construction workers' jobs, which the president made note of in his speech? Also, why should Australian workers believe any claims your government is making about the success of the Accord on wages, job security and containment of the boom-bust economic cycle?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2235" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the last point, because they are true&mdash;that is why they should believe them, and the statistics establish that. I am surprised that you should raise that question. If we do a comparison of real wage growth under our government compared with real wage growth under the Fraser government when Mr Howard was Treasurer, real wage growth faltered under you but rose under us. That is what the statistics show&mdash;that is why people believe it. They know it to be a fact&mdash;that is why they believe it. They can jingle the extra coins in their pocket&mdash;that is why they believe it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On the question of the Accord, the Accord has served the Australian community very well over the nearly 13 years of this government. It has managed to do this: it has managed to moderate growth in wages, enabled the government to trade that off against tax cuts and enabled the government to grow the social wage so that the living standards of ordinary Australians improve. At the end of the day, if you hark back to the bad old days of the Fraser government we were all too familiar with high wage increases eroded by high inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have broken the back of the inflation stick, as you know, Senator Crane. The levels of inflation that Australia has now are much much lower than what we were used to under the Fraser government. I think when Mr Fraser went out of power inflation was about 11.3 per cent. We are talking about keeping inflation in the range of two to three per cent. Your question sought to criticise me as to whether or not inflation is remaining in that range of two to three per cent. I remind you that when your party was last in government it was about 11.3 per cent. So let us get this thing in proportion. Essentially, it is living standards not high wages being eroded by high inflation. We have turned that around with the Accord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we have done it on a cooperative basis. We have worked with the unions and employers; and generated a cooperative industrial relations culture in Australian work places. The only work places in Australia where that is being upset are where there are state liberal governments introducing draconian industrial legislation. It brings back the bad old days of confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, I think, the only government in the world that has the privilege of saying honestly and openly that the union movement of this country has endorsed the Reserve Bank's inflation target. Accord mark 8 commits the Australian Council of Trade Unions to deliver a wages outcome which will keep inflation in the range of two to three per cent. No-one else in the world that I am aware of has got that commitment. The unions in this country have a track record of sticking to and delivering on their promises&mdash;and I expect them to deliver on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the remarks just last week of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser. While making an observation about the commitment, he too&mdash;from his remarks&mdash;expects them to deliver on that. That would be good news for Australia. Inflation trips around a bit as wage settlements come through. I suppose we will hear a bit this week about that from the commentators. But the outcome of two to three per cent is what is promised. While the index might oscillate a little, it is the outcome at the end of the day that counts, not the oscillations on the road to that outcome. As far as the boom-bust cycle in the building industry is concerned, I have been associated with the building industry in Australia for many years and it leaves&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In your answer, Minister, you said it was state governments which were providing the provocative, bad industrial systems. If that is the case, can you explain to us, as the ABS statistics show, why under the WA Lawrence Labor government for the year ending June 1991 there were 313 working days lost per thousand employees? That compares with the national figure of 254. We find that in the first full year of the Court government the number of working days lost under the same measure of per thousand employees was 46 at the state level compared with 82 at the federal level. If the state system is so bad, can you also explain to us why the recent minimum wage increase under the WA system was $16, which is double the $8 the Accord will produce under the federal system for those unfortunate enough to be the lowest paid employees. Isn't what you have just said and the answer you have just given further evidence of the litany of lies that your government is peddling at the current time?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a joke! I have eight questions and one minute to answer the lot. Let me take them as a job lot. The reason why those figures are able to be quoted is that during the period of the Lawrence government the level of industrial disputation in Western Australia was coming down from the very high levels of the former Court government. It continued on its pathway down during the early stages of the Dick Court government. But who stirred up the hornet's nest? Look at the figures now. We had most workers in Western Australia on strike, voluntarily removing themselves from their place of employment, to protest against that government's legislation. So in the face of that irrefutable fact, I do not know how you can contend that Liberal governments are better at industrial relations than are Labor governments. The reason why industrial disputes in Australia have fallen is that we have created the right climate of cooperation. We have turned our backs on the confrontation that marks your governments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and it relates to the announcement on Friday by the Queensland and Commonwealth governments of a $16 million package to protect the mahogany glider and other flora and fauna along the Queensland coastline. I ask the minister to outline to the Senate how this welcome package will protect these species.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2237" SPEAKER="Faulkner Sen J.P." NAMEID="5K4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ENVIRONMENT, SPORT AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the Queensland and Commonwealth governments have put in place a sugar coast environment rescue package. Each government will be contributing $8 million to that package over three years. The $16 million rescue package will greatly benefit a number of threatened species. One of the most important of these, and certainly one which has received a lot of recent publicity, is the mahogany glider. Until 1989, the mahogany glider was thought to be extinct. This package will protect the habitat which is critical to the survival of the glider. It will ensure that habitat loss is minimised and that corridors between the various colonies are protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the significance of this package should be underestimated. I notice that its importance has been recognised in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin </EMPHASIS>by the man who rediscovered the species in 1989, Steve van Dyck. Mr van Dyck is right to be very enthusiastic about the package. The reality is that, if we did not do this&mdash;the buy-back, the conservation plan and the declaration of critical habitat under the Queensland act&mdash;there would be a real risk that the glider and other species, such as the southern cassowary, would become extinct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Development has led to incredible pressures on the habitats of these endangered and threatened species. This package will enable the Queensland government to buy back more than 38,000 hectares along the Queensland coastline. Most of the crucial mahogany glider habitat areas between the Sunshine Coast and Cairns will now be bought back and added to existing national parks. Voluntary conservation agreements will be introduced on the remaining crucial habitat areas. Land holders will be offered half a million dollars worth of financial incentives to undertake these agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government has also announced that it will introduce a conservation plan for the mahogany glider under its Nature Conservation Act. This will limit activities threatening to the existence of gliders while allowing for the continuation of existing and future uses which are compatible to the conservation of the gliders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage, Tom Barton, and I look forward to the support of the sugar industry on the implementation of this package. I am delighted that the canegrowers have already expressed strong support for the package in a letter to the Prime Minister. This package really reflects the federal government's ongoing commitment to protecting endangered species. More broadly, again, it really reinforces this government's commitment to protecting the environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. In June 1992, in my minority report to the Senate superannuation committee, I called for a portion of superannuation to be invested in Australian venture capital projects with export potential, which I see the Prime Minister now expressing some interest in. Why did not the government think this was an important issue in 1993-94, when unemployment was at 10 per cent and domestic investment was low? Why did the government not think this was important before the 1995 budget announcement to introduce the employee co-contribution, which will give the funds another $10 billion a year?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will ignore the last comment as a cheap shot, because, frankly, that is what it is. I took it that you used a cheap analogy in order to illustrate your point. Let me go to the point so that I can keep away from the cheapness of that shot and concentrate on the substance of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this question, the impartial listener or viewer would think that we are not concerned about this issue or have just lately become concerned about it. That is not true. We have been concerned about it all the way along. The difference is that we have a different way of approaching the solution to it than you have. The difference between us is that you would intervene and direct, whereas we would encourage the market to work more efficiently. It is for the community to judge which is the most important path here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to remember that superannuation funds are contributions made by and on behalf of workers in Australia in order to provide for their retirement. The management of those funds is a very serious matter, in order to ensure that when those workers retire they can retire in a dignified way and with an income for which they have invested and provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a measure of this government that we introduced that on a fair basis. Prior to our period in government superannuation applied only to a select group of white collar workers and senior company executives. Now it applies to just about everyone in Australia, including the lowliest blue-collar worker to the highest executive as well. Everyone has the right to superannuation. That is something that the opposition have fought against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than direct the people who have entrusted in them the management of those funds, we have always believed that you give that responsibility to the elected appointees of the beneficiaries to manage that fund so that you do not have government directing, you have the elected trustees of the funds managing those funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have provided that the legislation under which we have done this allows those trustees to have a balanced portfolio of investments. That is a way of saying that a balanced portfolio would be a portfolio in which there was provision of funds for venture capital and there was provision of funds for developmental capital, as well as some funds in long-term maturities which would ensure that the return to the overall fund was balanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Prime Minister has been saying in recent days that he is unhappy with the way in which some of those funds have addressed that balance. He is not alone in that. There is quite considerable objective support for his concern. For example, the National Investment Council study `Financing Growth' noted that the proportion of investment in superannuation funds in venture development capital seems to be only about half the 3.5 per cent level of the United States; that is, we do not manage our venture and developmental capital investments as well as they do in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not necessarily a reason to direct it. It is certainly a reason to provide, as we did recently, that there should be reporting for five-year horizons of investment in superannuation funds. It is certainly a reason to encourage better training, understanding and education of trustees so that they better understand risk and are better able to make those assessments, and it is a reason for a number of those other things. But if the dividing point comes down to whether we direct or whether we encourage the market to work, I guess you are among the interventionists; we are among those encouraging the market to work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did have the letter by Susan Bastick of the Australian Family Association drawn to my attention today. I have to say that that letter by Mrs Bastick draws very considerably on the comments by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues in the Lyons forum. Mr Howard in particular and the Lyons forum in one of its recommendations have come out as very strong supporters of income splitting. They actually want to attack this government's targeted payments, for example, those to single mothers, and at the same time they want to argue for the very regressive program of income splitting&mdash;and regressive and very expensive it is.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to yesterday's damning comments by the Executive Director of the Australian Investment Managers Association, Mr Ian Matheson, who described the Prime Minister's intervention in the Coles Myer affair as extraordinary and unwarranted, and alleged that Mr Keating and Mr Kelty were more interested in helping their business mates than anything else. Isn't it a fact that Mr Keating's intervention at such a decisive stage in the institution's battle to bring about comprehensive reforms in the corporate governance of Coles Myer has resulted in a compromise well short of the institution's preferred position and one which is certainly not in accordance with the wishes of the shareholders? Why is Mr Keating not prepared to argue the case for improved standards of corporate governance?

Once you invite the court to deliver such an opinion you must accept the possibility that there might be a finding that the use or threat of nuclear weapons might, in some circumstances, be legal. If you invite an opinion you have to accept the possibility that it might not be the opinion you want.

Does the minister agree that water use in the basin is too high? Do you see the wakening or activating of sleeper licences, as water licences able to be sold, a problem? Will you be immediately planning for a substantial reduction in the volume of water being used in the Murray-Darling Basin?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, not just I but all of the ministers involved in the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, saw the issue of sleeper licences as a problem. I think, from memory, those licences could have activated around 14 per cent of additional demand on the system had they been activated. Indeed, that was one of the issues that was very live in considering the action that we did take this year&mdash;unprecedented action, I might add, in respect of that particular body&mdash;in capping further diversions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A water audit was carried out by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission on a request from the ministerial council, which I chair, and the results of that audit were presented to us in June of this year. What the audit clearly revealed was something we had all known but we wanted quantified, and indeed had it quantified; that is, that the diversions from this system&mdash;a system which, I might add, produces about 60 per cent of the entire agricultural product of this country&mdash;had made a significant change to both the environment and the quality of the water. In broad terms, what the audit revealed was that diversions from the system had reduced the outflows from the system from around&mdash;do not hold me to these exact figures, Senator&mdash;12,000 gigalitres down to 2,500 gigalitres; in other words, about 21 per cent of the natural outflows from that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the council made the decision this year to cap. I might add that that is an interim cap. That cap is subject to an intense amount of work that is currently being undertaken by a working party that has been set up by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission of all of the state authorities involved. That is currently examining all of the things that will need to be done in order to implement that cap and to give attention to the further management of the entire system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of that audit was clear: if diversions from the Murray-Darling Basin system occurred at the existing rate, then the use of water in the Murray-Darling Basin would have become unsustainable by the turn of this century; that is, in five years time.

In other words, even with your cap, we can see an increased amount of water being used.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that, in answering a question, a minister must be relevant to the question. It is for the President to make a judgment whether an answer is relevant to a question. If the answer is not relevant, the President requires the minister to be relevant.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee considered whether reflections on the questioner could be relevant and concluded, `as with all questions of relevance, this must be left to the judgment of the chair'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my very first predecessor, President Baker, ruled in 1904, relevance means relevance to the subject matter under consideration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that there is a tendency to confuse relevance and responsiveness. An answer can be relevant to a question&mdash;that is, it can deal with the same subject matter&mdash;without necessarily being responsive to the question. If a question asks whether the level of foreign debt is undermining the economy and a minister answers that the economy is sound because of factors that outweigh the foreign debt, the minister's answer is clearly relevant in so far as it deals with the same subject matter&mdash;the state of the economy&mdash;although the answer may not be responsive in so far as it is not confined to the effect of foreign debt on the economy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Childs this day, relating to science and technology in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook invites the debate on his inadequate and really quite pitiful performance as science minister. His answer gives me a few minutes to raise a few of those disappointments to Australia's science community. The trouble is that this government and these ministers spend so much of their time conjuring up fear campaigns that the whole functioning of government seems to have been abandoned. Senator Cook and his colleagues should spend less time at fundraisers such as that of the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr&mdash;a $2,500 a plate fundraiser to pay for such lying campaigns as that initiated in Western Australia at the moment and that designed to strike fear into the hearts of Australians. Rather, they should address the enormous failures that exist within this community, with 760,000 Australians still out of work. The community would be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But they have abdicated the functions of government for, it seems, what is going to be 12 months to continue this fear campaign. One of the functions of government that this senator has abdicated is his function as science minister. You have only to look at his record. Last year at the ANZUS conference he promised the Australian science community an innovation statement. But that community is still waiting. Month after month we have been expecting this grand innovation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we know about the statement is that he took a draft to his backbench committee and they said it was pitiful and hopeless. And then they leaked the fact to the press. So we still don't have this grand innovation statement. I read now that it is off until December and that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has now taken it out of the hands of Senator Cook because the Prime Minister is going to have it absorbed within some wider statement. What a disappointment that is to the Australian science community. Just look at some of our major scientific institutions under his administration. The CSIRO has been cut by $60 million over three years. It is in a real leadership vacuum. The board has been in an impossible position because this minister and this government have shown it no leadership whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even a Senate committee tried to put forward some constructive ideas. What was the government's response? A very helpful and useful report was handed down nine months ago. Has this minister responded? What are his ideas? He has not even bothered to respond. What a demonstration of his lack of concern as to the welfare of our major scientific institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at some of the others. ANSTO has had the guts ripped out of it. The government wanted another assessment of safety, which was very reasonable. How did ANSTO fund that? It had to be funded from within. Its functions are under stress. There was another review from within of the space program. Everyone knows that that is code for this government abandoning the space program. It is continually extending the responsibility of AIMS in relation to maritime science. But it has received no further funding. It has been put in an absolutely impossible position. One could go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So many areas of science are in need. There is the whole area of science education. Universities are concerned that students graduating from school are not skilled for first year university science. There is a low level of students taking up science in school. There is a need for professional development programs for teachers in science. This minister is not interested in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the problems with universities conducting research? Is this government doing something about the inadequate research infrastructure that has been allowed to run down to the extent whereby the Boston Consulting Group says it would cost $120 million per year simply to restore the research infrastructure of universities to a point where they would be internationally competitive? There were a few dollars in the last budget for it, but there was next to no real money for what is critically important to the future of science in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first point, I am pleased that a question to me from one of my back bench colleagues on the opposition's science policy has smoked out the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) to say something about it. He has been the most silent shadow that I have ever had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that I wish he would talk sense. I will quote from the prestigious international magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature </EMPHASIS>dated 18 May 1995 on the condition of science in Australia. The article is written by its editor Sir John Maddox on his review of Australia and Australian science:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general conclusion is that Australian science is in good shape . . . Australia may at last have found the right arrangements for the management of publicly supported research . . . industrial research spending has been growing quickly, more quickly than in any other OECD country.</PARA>
<PARA>I will quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS>, another international and prestigious magazine, talking about science:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you take any of the conventional measures of scientific excellence, whether it be numbers of Nobel prize winners, scientific papers published, citations per paper, heads of international conferences, and so on, then Australia does extremely well for its GNP and population.</PARA>
<PARA>I will cite another statistic. Last year, on the OECD table, Australia moved from seventh to fourth in terms of public sector expenditure on research and development. All the money the public sector expends, which is virtually nothing by the states or the Commonwealth, meant that we jumped over Austria, Italy and Canada from seventh to fourth in the rankings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now ranked fourth in the world for public sector expenditure and research and development. That is not a bad record. With the innovation statement I suspect we will go further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I announced the innovation statement as the next tranche of industry policy. I have had over 1,000 consultations around Australia. The fact that the presentation of the statement has been delayed excites the opposition. I always said in those consultations I would be very pleased if the Prime Minister delivered the innovation statement, because that would give greater status to it and to me as a cabinet minister. The Prime Minister will deliver the innovation statement and therefore give it that greater status. It will be a comprehensive statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That creates fear and loathing in the opposition, because they are afraid that we have got our act together. When we look at the opposition's science and industry policy, in this debate to take note of the answer, we see that its science and technology policy was leaked to the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>. What does it say? Three startling and devastating things. Firstly, the minister for science will be a member of cabinet. The name of the department will be changed from the Department of Industry, Technology and Science to Industry, Science and Engineering. Whatever happened to technology? It is a $600 billion industry in the world at the moment. Apparently that has been overlooked by the opposition. Thirdly, the Australia Prize, which is an annual prize of international repute and standing awarded in a category nominated every year by Australian scientists but open to the world, is a prize which will be cut down and turned into a John Howard Prime Minister's prize with a lot of little prizelets as well. Even as pork barrelling, that does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of linking Australian scientists in fields of their own competence and expertise with the best in the world, and then emphasising an area of science important to the economy of Australia, the opposition have let the whole thing pass them by. The cheapest shot in the opposition's science policy, as has been leaked to the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> and reported by it yesterday, is that with the change in title the opposition has at last caught up with the government; science should be with industry and not with education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition proposes to take the science responsibility off Senator Hill and give it to Mr John Moore, my shadow in industry. At least they have got that bit right; it should be with industry. In terms of opposition rankings, John Moore is inferior to Senator Hill, so it is a cover for a down grading. It also confirms the rumours that we have had around the science community that Senator Hill is bored by science; he is not interested in it; he doesn't like it; and now he has dumped it on his colleague John Moore. </PARA>

That is a separate question, which I wasn't going to talk about because it was so rambling and incoherent it was difficult to understand.

I found it astounding that anybody on the other side would seek to attack anybody who calls for more and better finance for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems in supporting innovation and the problems in supporting small business in this country are really because of the boom-bust cycle. You can talk about policy all you like; you can talk about innovation, science and universities. It has to have a commercial underpinning. That comes from small business in this country. Overwhelmingly, the big problem for small business has been the boom-bust cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, innovation takes long periods to develop; whereas when the boom-bust cycle comes along small businesses are the first to go to the wall. They can't cope with periods of high inflation; they can't cope with periods where wages get out of control. They are the first ones to go because they do not have the capital base that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators opposite are very quick to say that we have had only two minutes of economic sunshine. They are wedded to that very boom-bust cycle which destroys small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us call it five minutes. What senators opposite were referring to in their five minutes of economic sunshine was the September quarter national accounts last year which showed this economy running at an absolutely insupportable level. You would have to run the economy on amyl nitrate to keep it going as it did in that September quarter. The government quite rightly reduced the rate of growth in the economy with the selective use of monetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if you believe what senators opposite say, if you believe that that is the way the economy should be run and if you believe that that is supposed to be sunshine, then you will never have any innovation and you will never have any small business that is capable of developing innovation over the long periods of time that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was quite correct when he said there should be more and better access to finance for small business in this country. I can say from my own personal experience, having worked for a major financial institution, that that institution had been burnt so many times in the boom-bust cycles that the board had passed a rule that no-one within that company was allowed to invest in small business. That is the sort of change that the Prime Minister was seeking, Senator Panizza, for the benefit of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was saying, `Go back and have another look, now that we have an economy which can sustain investment in innovation over the longer term.' Now that we have an economy which can sustain that investment, institutions such as the one I worked for and many others should go back and look at their rules of investment and say, `It is now appropriate to invest in small business, riskier enterprises, in order to get a better return.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza, when you said in your rambling question that there was an increased risk and an increased return, you forgot to mention that there are also benefits from diversity. What the Prime Minister and the government have been seeking to do is to get people to invest in more businesses over a wider range and, therefore, reduce the risk involved in that investment for the great benefit, first of all, of the small business and of the investing public in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that there is an appalling lack of understanding on the other side of this chamber on financial matters, on innovation matters and, indeed, on a great many others. It would be dreadful if those opposite were ever to find themselves on the government benches, because clearly they do not have the understanding that is required.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I would like to point out what you people have done and what you did over nearly 26 years. In terms of science and technology, innovation, research and development, you did absolutely nothing. Your view of manufacturing wool was to put it in a bag and ship it away. Your view of mining was to take the iron ore and put it in a boat. You never did anything in terms of research and development over all the time when you had the opportunity to&mdash;the times you keep referring to as the good old days.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to start blaming people, the worst years I find were 1973, 1974 and 1975 when Mr Whitlam was in power. I am rather surprised that Senator Cook did not walk into this chamber today and blame Mr Whitlam for the fact that Richard Court had better figures than Carmen Lawrence. It is an absolute nonsense to turn the clock back and make those comparisons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that must hurt those opposite is the fact that the minimum wage increase of $16 in Western Australia, which was announced last Friday, comes into effect in October. Under the Accord, people in a similar situation will receive $8 in March 1996&mdash;some five months later. The litany of lies that we have seen propagated in Western Australia over the last 36 hours is simply that: nothing else but lies on lies. Those lies will come back to haunt this government. The public will find out the truth. The public can count. The public knows that $16 a week is double $8 a week, and they know that this will be paid six to eight months earlier than the increases under the federal system. It is also worth noting that under the federal system workers will receive $14 in 1997, $14 in 1998 and $14 in 1999. When we get to 1999 those workers have still not received the same increase. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally I would not enter into this debate, but the reason I am speaking on this motion to note the answer is that I was the guest speaker at the Master Builders Association annual dinner in Canberra last Wednesday night. I was honoured to deliver the A.V. Jennings memorial lecture. I sat next to Ron Doubikin at the head table both before and after his speech. I heard all his remarks and I say quite bluntly that I disagree with much of what he said about the state of industrial relations in the building and construction industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were quite a few master builders present at that function. I think people in the construction industry would also genuinely have a disagreement with Ron about some of his views. Ron and I had a long chat after his speech about his own experiences in the building industry in Western Australia. I cannot make a factual judgment on the ins and outs of his experiences in the building industry. He pointed out that he is still in commercial dispute with a number of his clients. There is no doubt that at times he has had disputes with the unions. His perceptions are quite rightly and quite understandably affected by his experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Crane that as Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction I get around to a lot of places in Australia involved in the building industry. There are many builders, big and small, who are very committed to the reform process in the construction industry which has been bedevilled by bad union practices and bad management practices on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gyles royal commission in New South Wales, which was instigated by a Liberal government, found that on both sides of the fence there were some illegal activities and practices, which have led to charges, and that some major construction companies were into fixing tenders and so on. Both sides realise that the industry, which has a turnover of well over $20 billion a year and employs hundreds of thousands of people, cannot go on running the way it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever views people like Ron Doubikin have about getting stuck into the unions and the workers they represent do not matter because, in the end, the industry will only be reformed by genuine consultation and discussion between both sides. The CFMEU, the main union in the building industry, has been a very strong advocate of the reform process. That union and a range of big and small companies in the construction and housing industry are committed to the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We established the National Construction Industry Council so that all of those representatives could come together to discuss ways in which the reform process could go on in coming years in Australia. No-one on either side wants to go back to incidents like those that occurred in the 1980s. That is certainly the government's policy. I do not think the views expressed by Ron Doubikin will automatically get us over the problems that he sees. He was just laying the blame at the union's feet. </PARA>

Most of the people I have talked to in the building industry have had pretty direct arguments with the union associated with the construction and building industry, but they have also realised that they have a number of faults too. They will not overcome them if they take the view that the Court government has in Western Australia which is to smash the workers and smash the unions and then out of the pieces hope you have a high quality, innovative, outwardly looking industry. If we take your message we will end up with an industry that is not flat and is not able to be internationally competitive and export oriented, which is the policy of most of the industry in Australia these days. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VARIATION TO THE 1995 SPRING LEGISLATION PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATEMENT OF REASONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Purpose of the proposed amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The main purpose of the proposed Bill is to clarify the power of the Commissioner to terminate the appointment of police and staff members of the members of the Australian Federal Police (AFP). This power is provided for at section 26E of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (the AFP Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Commissioner's power to terminate appointments is part of the special employment scheme for the AFP which was introduced in 1990. It is a specific anti-corruption measure intended to reduce the dangers of entrenched corruption such as has been uncovered at various times in other police forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The main difficulty is that section 26E, as it presently stands, contains restrictions which prevent the Commissioner from dealing with the kinds of situations which the power was intended to cover. Subsection 26E(3) currently prohibits the Commissioner from terminating an appointment solely because of an act or omission which has been, or could be, the subject of a charge under AFP (Discipline) Regulations or because of a court conviction for a criminal offence. The Commissioner's difficulties are compounded when lengthy criminal or disciplinary processes have commenced, or are in prospect, with uncertain outcomes, and the Commissioner has already had reasonable cause to have lost confidence in a member's or staff member's suitability for continued employment. The Bill will omit subsection 26E(3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The Bill will also allow AFP appointees, in most circumstances, to access the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Currently AFP appointees are excluded from these provisions by Industrial Relations Regulations. However, there will be an exception where an appointment is terminated because the Commissioner is satisfied that continued retention of the individual would be immediately harmful to the integrity, reputation and status of the AFP. In those exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner's decision will continue to be excluded from the unfair dismissal provisions but the individual will retain a right to seek judicial review of the decision and an entitlement to compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The other proposed amendments are uncontroversial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 34(5), which specifies the disciplinary liability of police members when granted special leave of absence for service with an Organisation provided for in the Industrial Relations Act 1988, is to be amended so that the provision also applies to civilian staff members. This is a consequential amendment to the commencement of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Act 1994 which extends the application of the Principal Act to staff members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 25 relates to the power of the Commissioner, when authorised by the Governor-General, to appoint commissioned officers. The Bill will allow the Governor-General also to authorise the Deputy Commissioners to have this power of appointment in order to cover situations where the Commissioner is unavailable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for seeking introduction and passage in the same sitting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service has named several serving and former members of the AFP as having been involved in serious corruption. Individual officers are publicly identified as being corrupt only when the Royal Commissioner is certain that there is strong evidence against the person. Evidence relevant to corruption involving AFP members will be made available to the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The public naming of serving AFP officers by the Royal Commission can be expected to have a significant impact on public confidence in the AFP. It will also affect the AFP's credibility with other police forces, both Australian and overseas, potentially undermining their willingness to share sensitive information thereby harming the AFP's effectiveness. For these reasons the Commissioner wishes to act as quickly as possible to terminate the appointment of any member where the Commissioner is satisfied that he or she has been involved in serious corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. Another reason for seeking introduction and passage in the Spring sittings is that the Industrial Relations Regulations which prevent AFP appointees from accessing the unfair dismissal remedies (see paragraph 4) are due to expire on 1 January 1996. New Regulations will be necessary if the Bill is not enacted by that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons why the need for the amendments was not foreseen</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The higher priority is a result of the linking of AFP members with serious corruption by the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed Customs Tariff Bill 1995 will give effect to the extensive classification changes in the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System of the World Customs Organisation. The changes affect 1/3 of the current Customs Tariff Act 1987, and this Bill will effectively introduce a new Tariff Bill in much the same way as the current 1987 Tariff replaced the 1982 Tariff following a similar international harmonisation exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary consideration of the Bill this Sittings is necessary primarily because of the 6 month lead time which this legislation requires before its commencement. The World Customs Organisation, of which Australia is an active member, is committed to a 1996 commencement of the new harmonised description and classification system. Australia has indicated its preparedness to have the new system in by 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To accommodate that mid-year commencement, the Bill will need to be in place by at least 1 January 1996.

The Government has made a commitment that the Tribunal will be able to deal effectively and efficiently with medical evidence complaints from 1 November 1995 and wishes to honour its commitment by ensuring that the necessary amendments to enable the Tribunal to deal with such complaints in an effective and efficient manner are in place by that date;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also `transfer' a number of temporary modification declarations made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner under Part 29 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) into the actual body of the SIS Act itself. The SIS Act provides that these temporary declarations (which in effect represent part of the Act) will cease to have effect from 30 June 1996. Unless legislation to replace these declarations is included in the SIS Act well in advance of this date then serious disruption could be caused to significant parts of the superannuation industry. For example, many small (less than 5 member) funds would suddenly, and inappropriately, be classified as `public offer funds' and the trustee of such funds (which is often `mum or dad') would need to become a corporate trustee, be approved by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and meet stringent financial backing requirements (such as having $5 million in net tangible assets). It is considered essential that these amendments are passed in the Spring Sittings to avoid problems of this sort emerging and to provide the necessary comfort to industry well in advance of the 30 June 1996 cut off date.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seven measures (various capital gains tax amendments, trust losses, research and development, horticulture plantations, franking credits/profit shifting, demutualisation of life and general insurance companies, forestry plantations) have a commencement date of 9 May 1995, and therefore have an impact on 1994-95 income tax returns.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The occupational clothing register amendments relate to the cessation of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority on 29 February 1996.

<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, it is urgent that this matter be debated by the Senate today because there are indications that, once again, it will be swept under the carpet. Twice the New South Wales parliament voted unanimously to call for a joint federal-state inquiry into this matter: once on 9 December 1991, and again on 21 September 1995. In other words, the ALP in opposition and in government voted for this particular motion, and the coalition in opposition and in government voted for this particular motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his letter to me dated 18 September 1995, the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, said that Commonwealth police shared responsibility for the personal protection of delegates, when outside the conference venue, jointly with the New South Wales police.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General uses that as one of the main points for saying that the Australian government need not and should not be involved in an inquiry. It is therefore on the cards that the government will once again back off. The urgency of this particular matter to be debated by the Senate today, however, is supported by the fact that we now have two additional items of information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report of the outgoing Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Roger Holdich, we are told that not one but two ASIO agents were inside the Ananda Marga. And, further, that ASIO had withheld from the courts information obtained from both these agents which would have affected these judicial proceedings. Further, we are told&mdash;and it is reported in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper&mdash;that a scientist had been asked by ASIO to prepare two bombs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> further reports&mdash;and the date of that article is 27 July 1995 by Sheena McLean&mdash;that two politicians, the federal Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Frank Walker, and a former Labor state MP, Mr George Petersen, say that the scientist came forward to reveal that he had been asked to make two bombs. The bombs were to contain live explosives but the detonator mechanisms were to be benign. </PARA>

Yet we are told by the Attorney-General that this is not a matter concerning ASIO or the Commonwealth government. But it is a matter that does concern a number of Australian people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the suspension of standing orders.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should point out, of course, that this matter has been going on in one form or another since 1978. It is 17 years since the tragic incident took place. There have been innumerable inquiries at the New South Wales state government level, and people have been gaoled and then released. I do not profess to know all the ins and outs of all of those details. One has to be a considerable expert in the so-called Hilton case to follow it all. But we do not believe this motion has to come on now after a suspension of standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any suggestion that this government is trying to hide any background on this because it could be embarrassing just does not stand up, as we were not the government at the time. When this whole episode took place way back in 1978, the Fraser coalition government was in office. So there would be nothing embarrassing to this government if any event did involve any federal government agency. It was clearly not of this government's making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far not enough evidence has been put forward to warrant us holding a royal commission&mdash;a very expensive royal commission. If such issues do exist, we believe that the New South Wales government, as the relevant authority, would be willing to have its own royal commission. So far, I see that they are apparently not willing to do so. We do not believe that there is enough evidence and I believe that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in the letter to you, Senator Spindler, recently made that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all seen royal commissions used in recent times for particular political purposes but at great expense to the taxpayer. The Attorney-General's view is that until further evidence is put forward to warrant the expense of a royal commission, which just by the very fact of calling one would cost several million dollars&mdash;and that evidence has so far not been produced&mdash;we believe it is a matter for the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, we are now debating at the moment not the merits of the Hilton case at all, but the issue of whether there should be a suspension of standing orders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For very much similar reasons to those outlined by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), the coalition will support the government in opposing the Australian Democrats motion to suspend standing orders to ensure that this matter is debated here and now. I do not say at all that this is not an important matter. The integrity of your judicial system and your law enforcement agencies, including ASIO, is an essential element of a properly functioning, free, democratic society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When any of these agencies are put under threat, or a cloud is put over their name, there is obviously a great desire by those people who see the integral part that they played cleared up. I do not take Senator Spindler's suggestion that the matter be debated now as an attempt to get stuck into ASIO; but, rather, as an attempt to clear ASIO of these allegations that are hanging around. But I have some sympathy with the view put forward by the minister that there perhaps is not sufficient evidence at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like Senator Spindler, unless he has had information made available to him that has not been made available to me, am not in possession of some information that the government is clearly in possession of. But as I indicated to Senator Spindler recently, in this pre-election environment something tells me down to my bones that if there was something in there that could smear a past Liberal government, this government would have dug it out and rushed off to have a royal commission as quick as it could. I just somehow feel that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forgive me for the cynicism with which I approach this matter. But I look across on the other side and think, if you could pin this on a law enforcement agency when there was a Liberal government, you would be doing it. Maybe my cynicism is misplaced, I don't know; I certainly hope not. The thought did occur to me, though, when the minister was raising exactly the same point in his remarks, that if the subsequent inquiries&mdash;and I do not have the dates of those fixed in my mind&mdash;flowed over into a Labor government&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be a point. But if that is the case, I am not sure that you will ever get to the bottom of the matter&mdash;ever. And you do have to consider the extent to which you allocate taxpayers' money to express your desire to get to the bottom of it. There has to be a point at which you say, `Not only does this express my desire to get to the bottom of it, but I actually think we are effectively spending taxpayers' money.' We can all come in here and express the desire that this matter should have already been resolved and should not be hanging around as one of the myths and that it should be removed off the political horizon. We can all want that in our heart of hearts, and our minds might tell us it is the best thing to do. But, as the minister rightly says, a royal commission will cost millions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless you have at the commencement of that commission a genuine view that you will resolve the matter, all you will be doing is spending more taxpayers' money and adding to the consternation in the community about the matter. The minister will probably say it is misplaced confidence, but I do believe that this side of politics will win the next election. At that point, if I am offered the job that I have now in a shadow capacity, I may be in a better position to know. I may be in a `Yes, Minister' position, as Senator Margetts indicates, and be snowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just rise to say that we do not believe this should have priority today. It is an opportunity which Senator Spindler has taken to put his view on the record. We do not believe it should have priority. We believe that the integrity of the judicial system and of law enforcement agencies is at the centre of a free parliamentary system. But you do not make that point just by spending money; you actually have to achieve something when you do it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that the Greens do support Senator Spindler's motion to suspend standing orders to discuss at greater length the issue of an inquiry into the Hilton bombing. I will speak mainly to the urgency but, in recognition that we will not be considering the debate any further, I will mention some of the reasons relating to its seriousness because I feel that goes to the urgency as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only 16 sitting days left this year and possibly of this parliament. These are the most serious of unresolved allegations that will not go away. Senator Schacht said basically that this has been going on for 17 years, that it happened 17 years ago and that that was the reason it is not urgent. But one could also say that it becomes increasingly urgent to address it in order to withstand allegations that we are deliberately turning a blind eye to the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, some new matters have been raised. Recently, the new Premier of New South Wales has made a decision to release previously closed files on the matter. Also, Mr Pederick's lawyers have made a decision to petition the New South Wales Attorney-General for a review of Mr Pederick's conviction on the basis that he is no longer confident of his own admissions of involvement in the bombing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a most serious matter that requires Senate scrutiny. It involves the unsolved murders arising from allegedly one of Australia's most serious acts of terrorism. I say `allegedly' because that is the crux of the outstanding allegations: was the bombing the result of some mysterious unidentified&mdash;up to now&mdash;terrorists; or were Australia's own security forces somehow involved in the bombing itself? Such allegations are of a serious nature. It would be improper for the Senate not to debate the motion at length before the Senate calls for an inquiry into the affair. The substantive motion calling for an inquiry is very similar to a motion moved by the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, there are two sets of victims arising out of the Hilton bombing. One qualification I would give to the implied support of the Greens to the motion moved by Senator Spindler is that we need to prevent scapegoating of the second set of victims. The first set of victims are those who were killed or injured at the blast itself. People like Terry Griffiths, who has suffered years of physical pain and mental anguish, deserve to have all allegations concerning who was involved in the bombing cleared up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second set of victims are those who were wrongly accused and spent years in gaol after being convicted of the bombing. This is where I would like to sound a note of warning. While agreeing to support the suspension of standing orders so Senator Spindler's motion can be debated, we feel it is critical to note that, in calling for a further inquiry into the bombing, we should not allow the second set of victims to be further attacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An open-ended inquiry without specific terms of reference would allow previously discredited witnesses to try to resurrect failed police theories. Any future inquiry should look at the unresolved issues such as: were any members of the security forces in any way involved in the bombing; did any members have prior knowledge that the bombing was to take place; why were sniffer dogs not used to search for explosives prior to the bombing; when was the warning call to police received; and was it properly acted on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, just last month, a report by the detective involved in the wrongful prosecution was tabled in the New South Wales parliament. Again, the detective tried to reignite old theories. Those like Tim Anderson, having already spent years in gaols for a crime that the courts later found they did not commit, were forced to defend themselves once again. There seems little doubt that an inquiry without proper terms of reference would cause certain interests to again peddle scapegoat theories. Here I have to agree with Senator Vanstone that we do need to make sure it is an effective inquiry. That is why there is a need for further debate. If we do not debate it here, who will and when will it be done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clearly a Commonwealth government responsibility. The Commonwealth government has previously said it will cooperate with a New South Wales inquiry but that it sees the primary responsibility resting with New South Wales. However, the bombing occurred at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting where federal government agencies were in charge of security. The most serious allegations still outstanding involve Commonwealth security organisations, so clearly there is an onus on the federal government to act. Both of the major parties have indicated the seriousness of the Hilton bombing and the need to resolve it. I regret they are not supporting this motion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>On behalf of the joint standing committee, I have much pleasure in tabling the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer education: the military after next</EMPHASIS>. The report is the culmination of 12 months of considerable effort by members of the defence subcommittee. The reference from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) asked the committee to examine the provision of academic studies and professional military education to officer cadets and officers of the Australian Defence Force. This involved an examination of nine training establishments, reviewing the suitability of the current system and then looking at what is needed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry has been particularly timely. At a time when there have been major changes to Australia's strategic environment and reductions in defence spending, it is appropriate that the professional development of ADF officers be re-examined. The committee undertook most seriously its task to look at the current training systems to ensure that we are preparing officers who will be able to lead the ADF into the 21st century, where a fundamentally different set of global, regional and national security arrangements will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned earlier, the inquiry looked at nine colleges and the role they play in the professional development of the officer corps. The committee is aware of other pathways leading to professional military development and has commented on them in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The profession of arms is uniquely demanding. It is also unique in that its members do not engage in their primary profession&mdash;war fighting&mdash;on an everyday basis. The problem facing the educators and trainers of military professionals is to prepare them not only for the eventuality of combat but also for the vast range of other tasks which military professionals perform in peacetime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the committee noted in its report, the ADF is to be commended for the high calibre of its officer corps. The members of the committee continue to be impressed by the professionalism and competence of the ADF officers we met on the course of the inquiry and on other activities undertaken by the committee, such as its attendance at the Kangaroo 95 exercise. The committee has been concerned that the high standards of officer performance should not diminish as a result of any reduction in resources allocated to Defence. An important goal of this inquiry, therefore, was to canvass ways in which academic studies and professional military education can be delivered more cost effectively to the officer corps to maintain the high standards already being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Officer education: the military after next </EMPHASIS>is divided into five parts. The first four parts detail the findings of the committee on the system of professional development currently in place. In turn, pre-commissioning training, single service staff colleges and senior officer training as well as other avenues of professional development were discussed. The final section sets out the views of the committee on the suitability of the existing system for the future professional development of members of the officer corps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the whole report is the concept of the military after next. The concept emerged in the United States after the Gulf War. While I do not propose to go into much detail here about the concept and its implications for the ADF, I commend chapter 13 of this report to all senators with an interest in defence as it contains a very interesting discussion on these and related issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to this is the idea that middle and senior military commanders of the future will operate in a very different way from that typically conceived as the role of the commander today. Therefore, the committee believes it is imperative that the current system of providing academic studies and professional military education to officer cadets and officers of the ADF be able to produce officers who can effectively operate in this changed environment. Given the long lead times involved in producing middle and senior ranking officers in the ADF, the system of officer education needed to prepare these officers for the military after next therefore must be in place today. The report makes 20 recommendations in all, covering such issues as a comprehensive policy on higher education for officers, accreditation, a module approach to professional military studies and alternative delivery methods for the officer education system, such as distance education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining, I would briefly like to comment on recommendations 11 to 16, which will probably draw the most comment and discussion. These recommendations deal with the undergraduate program at the Australian Defence Force Academy, or ADFA. The committee has recommended that the university college undergraduate program conducted at ADFA be terminated and replaced by an undergraduate sponsorship scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at this matter, the committee examined the rationale for the establishment of the Australian Defence Force Academy. While there was controversy at the time about the decision to establish ADFA, the committee recognises that the ADF has benefited from that decision. ADFA has guaranteed a stream of officers with a university education. Jointery was a ground-breaking feature for ADFA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The academy has produced high quality officers for the ADF to captain equivalent. However, the environment has changed considerably since that decision to establish the academy was taken. The committee has reassessed ADFA in today's environment and against future needs and demands. Some members of the committee felt it was still too early to assess the ADFA experiment and to fully assess it in terms of the officers it produces. However, the majority of the committee did feel that it was possible to make a valid assessment of ADFA now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was concerned that an education at ADFA may not be an appropriate mechanism for integrating officer cadets into the community they are going to serve. Increasingly, the ADF needs to be part of, and draw from, the community. Potential officers are isolated and treated very differently from their peers in the community while they undertake their tertiary studies. In addition, the artificial ADFA environment means that cadets are not generally forced to face the very real issue of why they are part of the ADF at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee's view, the insular and institutionalised nature of officer development militates against proper integration and interaction with members of the community. The committee is concerned that the sheltered environment of ADFA may not be capable of consistently producing the type of officer which will be necessary in the military after next: one that is able to display initiative, lateral thinking, elements of risk taking, strong motivation, versatility and flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that recruiting graduates from civilian universities will benefit the ADF through the greater maturity of its potential officer corps at commissioning. These officers will have benefited from interaction with the civilian community during their university studies. In addition, they will have the advantage of forming associations with potential industrialists, public servants and others in a wider network than Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also significant resource aspects to this whole debate. The cost to Defence of the existing officer training system is $200 million. Of this, approximately 50 per cent, or $97.5 million, is spent on ADFA. If you do an examination of total students at all Defence colleges, you will find that approximately half of the total ADF college funding is spent on only about one-third of the total number of students. This raises the question of whether too high a proportion of the Defence training budget is being allocated to providing academic education to too small a proportion of the officer corps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report argues that there are two main ways in which Defence could recruit graduates from civilian universities. Defence could simply compete with other employers for recruits as students graduate, or they could seek to involve students in Defence activities during their studies by way of a sponsorship scheme or similar mechanisms. The committee has favoured the latter approach, as it provides Defence with a closer connection with the students, thereby enabling Defence to monitor their performance and level of interest throughout their undergraduate studies. It also provides Defence and the students with an opportunity to undertake military training during university semester breaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The undergraduate sponsorship scheme proposed by the committee has a number of distinguishing features. It targets approximately 1,000 graduate students per year for financial assistance in civilian universities. Allowing for normal attrition, 800 students would remain in the scheme at the end of year two, and 600 by the end of year three. From these, the ADF could select the most suitable 300 or so officer cadets for pre-commissioning training. Other suitable candidates could be offered commissions in the reserve forces or be recruited into other ranks, regular or reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While undertaking their undergraduate studies, students will embark upon a single service and common military training program during extended academic breaks. This would include some basic training, familiarisation and motivational visits to Defence establishments and observation of, and participation in, a range of enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sponsored students would be administered and supported by a regional office, which would take responsibility for arranging a single service in the common military training program during extended academic breaks. Selection into the scheme and the ADF upon completion of studies should be competitive. Recruitment for the ADF should rest on academic and military aptitude with no guarantee of employment upon graduation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this section of the report, in particular, to all interested in officer education in Australia. I know it is going to provide some people with food for thought and make people maybe argue their positions as to why they have certain beliefs and why they hold them now. That is not a bad thing when we are looking at the expenditure of government money and when we are looking at the training of officer cadets who are potential officers in the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to thank the staff involved in the inquiry process and the production of the final report: Gillian Gould and Matthew Mason-Cox, who were, in turn, secretary of the defence subcommittee during this inquiry; Wing Commander Ken Given, who was seconded to the secretariat for the first half of 1995 and who provided invaluable background knowledge and assistance to the subcommittee; and Mr Peter McLay, who provided excellent administrative assistance to the subcommittee during this inquiry. I commend this report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report of the inquiry into officer education. I wrote a brief dissenting report. I acknowledge that on a number of occasions the committee was aware of my concerns and did, as far as possible, acknowledge them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 9 of the report, paragraph 2.2 states, in relation to the attendance of students from overseas defence forces at the colleges identified in the terms of reference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">while the attendance of these overseas students provides valuable opportunities to establish military networks and further promotes Australia's policy of regional engagement, these views were not shared by all members of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that that member was me. I felt it necessary to point out the reasons why I had concerns with this. I have pointed this out in my short dissenting report. It is mainly because of the fact that we have evidence that a number of the officers from countries in our region who have been educated at Australian establishments have been involved in corps which have been involved in human rights abuses. We think that sounds a wrong message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see some acknowledgment that we could include a greater percentage of courses which deal with the rule of law in Australia. I think there is a problem in terms of general military training for officers when it is difficult to establish training in relation to an external conflict or an internal conflict. If we are talking about human rights abuses involved in the quelling of internal conflict, we might be training people who use that training to assist in perpetrating human right abuses. This is very difficult for us to control at this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the discussions which have occurred in relation to this have focused on the fact that by a form of osmosis officers from other countries who are mixing with officers from Australia, New Zealand or similar countries may take on the general ethos of the host country; they may take on the values of the other students in the course. If that is the theory, it should be the same in reverse. There are people whose general method of operation includes quelling of dissent by brutal means. Surely those values might, by reverse osmosis, be integrated into the beliefs and further actions of our own officers. I am not saying that the osmosis is the way it is happening. If it is happening in one direction, surely there is a possibility that it could happen in reverse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been an interjection that that is a long bow.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 13.45 notes that members of the Australian Defence Force provide advice to and liaison with members of parliament and the community generally. The reason this is mentioned in a report on training, I think, is very important. I know from my experience at Senate estimates that on occasions we get sharp retorts either from the minister or from the military, for instance, on requests for information, that it is not the job of members of the Australian Defence Force to `take time off their real job to answer questions'. I would say very strongly that in the democracy of which we are a part this is part of the real job of any defence force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you do not train officers to communicate defence policy and if you present a general picture to them that it is not their job and it is an inconvenience, then they are not going to be fulfilling their democratic role correctly, which is communicating policy, as all government funded bodies are required to do from time to time, to elected bodies. You are going to make it possible for people in those positions not to be particularly skilful in carrying out those duties. It will take a lot longer to get any information on the public record back to the parliamentary representatives. The whole process will be more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would not be such a point of criticism if it were not for the fact that quite a deal of resources in military establishments, in communicating policies&mdash;not to us, not to the parliamentary representatives and not through the process&mdash;is being used to present that information in order to sell policies and to sell upcoming programs to defence industry. I get very angry when it is possible for defence industry to get reports well before we get access to them or to get them when we do not get offered either the report or the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a lot of effort going into the training of officers to communicate so well with industry, perhaps some of that effort has to go into communicating defence policy more succinctly and more naturally within the democratic process. Then we would not feel so suspicious that information was being held back. If it is on the public record, it should be more available to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence expenditure is a very big expenditure. For the public to feel that that expenditure is being spent in the right way it is necessary for that communication to take place and those people in Defence who still feel it is not their role should get used to it. This is part of what Defence is supposed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one specific course in the colleges dealing with human rights. It is at the College of Defence and Strategic Studies. It had a human rights component. The focus, they said, was on the connection between the professional life of the officer, human rights norms and the objectives they are expected to fulfil. I got quite excited when I heard this was part of the program. I asked further. To my horror, I found that that course was being carried out by Australian Defence Industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe it is appropriate that an arms manufacturer and arms exporter, Australian or otherwise, is producing or teaching a course in human rights to Australian and overseas students of a fairly high rank. If you discount the social connection that occurs and the possible links with sales overseas that might occur during those courses, the fact is that we have a company whose role is to promote and sell Australian exports, and it sees that as its prime role. It is not appropriate that they be controlling or running the only actual course in human rights for officers of the Australian Defence Force. It ought to be looked at very carefully because it certainly does not look good in terms of the image of the Australian Defence Force in trying to do the right thing by building up their public image. If we are genuinely trying to educate officers from overseas and if some of the officers are coming from regimes where the military is used for putting down self-determination struggles or struggles against human rights abuses, it is not appropriate that Defence Industries is actually in charge of the course on values in human rights. That might also link with future sales of military equipment to those very regimes. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing staff currently comprises 27 Australia-based and 20 locally engaged staff. The Committee was advised that it is not envisaged that more diplomatic staff will be posted to Geneva, nor is it envisaged that further Australian missions will be posted there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian chancery in Geneva comprises leased premises which are deficient in access, services, layout and space. The lease will expire in March 1999 and will not be renewed. There is a need for a new chancery building to be constructed for Australia's permanent missions in Geneva.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 27 July and 8 August, as part of private visits to Geneva and Washington the Chair inspected the existing chancery and the site proposed for the new chancery in Geneva, and the Australian embassy in Washington.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visit to Geneva convinced him of the need for the work and gave him an appreciation of the suitability of the site for the chancery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Washington visit, it was helpful to have discussions with the ambassador and members of his staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without these inspections the Committee would have been fully reliant</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on brief videos which showed aerial and ground shots of the Geneva site and existing unsatisfactory accommodation in Washington.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee again draws attention to its inability to travel overseas to inspect existing premises, proposed sites and to have discussions with planners, designers and staff. The Committee regards this as a completely unsatisfactory situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has concluded that the proposed design of the Geneva chancery will provide a building suited to the task of providing accommodation for the three ambassadors of the four Australian missions in Geneva.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A feature of the chancery complex is the inclusion of a separate annex which will house the New Zealand mission. The Australian and New Zealand missions will be separated by a landscaped courtyard, which will hopefully include a symbolic water feature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes the concept of shared diplomatic premises, with nations such as New Zealand, could be extended to other projects when opportunities arise, and the Committee has recommended this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One rather disturbing aspect of our representation in Geneva is the very high cost of leasing residential accommodation for two of the three ambassadors and their Australia-based staff. It costs the Australian taxpayers almost two million dollars a year to provide residential accommodation for our diplomats in Geneva.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has therefore recommended that a review of existing residential accommodation is required aimed at reducing, or eliminating, the financially burdensome recurrent expenditure associated with leasing residential accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The design concept submitted to the Committee has not reached the detailed design stage and the Committee had recommended that consultations with the Community and Public Sector Union should continue during the detailed design phase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report I have tabled relates to the proposal by the Overseas Property Group to refurbish the Australian Embassy in Washington to a standard suitable for efficient and effective operation. The proposal entails a staged program of internal refurbishment to provide tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety, the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment and the provision of office accommodation which meet current data and communications needs. Physical security protection will also be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the proposal when referred to the Committee was 16 million dollars at November 1994 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original building with houses the Australian Embassy in Washington was constructed in 1969 and is well located at 1601 Massachusetts Avenue and was extended in 1976. The building is now 25 years old and has not undergone a major refurbishment since it was constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considering that the industry norm is to refurbish office buildings after 25 years, it is not unexpected that the Washington Embassy now has many deficiencies. It lacks suitable fire protection and fire egress which major building services have reached the end of their design life and require replacement. In addition, office layouts are inefficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision for current and future technology is inadequate. Physical security protection is also deficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Embassy services some 19 government departments and organisations with functions as diverse as foreign relations, defence immigration and trade. Washington is one of Australia's largest and most diverse overseas missions. Total staff number approximately 310. It is also the hub of the communications network for Australia's diplomatic missions in North and South America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPG advised that an energy audit of the building was undertaken in 1988 and since that time a 20% saving in energy usage has been achieved, mainly though the modification of plant operation and lighting levels. The Committee believes that there would be considerable merit in OPG testing the effectiveness of the energy conservation measures to be incorporated in the refurbishment program by undertaking an energy audit of the building following 12 months occupation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the building will remain operational during the refurbishment, the Committee has recommended that OPG continue to consult with staff and the Community and Public Sector Union during the refurbishment program to ensure minimal disruption and inconvenience to staff and other users of the building.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of the comprehensive double taxation agreement between Australia and the Czech Republic. The Bill will insert the text of the agreement into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 as a schedule to that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement with the Czech Republic was signed on 28 March 1995. The agreement allocates taxing rights over all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and the Czech Republic. Details of the agreement were announced and copies made publicly available at the time of signature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement generally accords with the other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. A feature of the agreement with the Czech Republic is that it is the first new agreement to include a revised dividends article which will have the effect of reducing Czech dividend withholding tax to 5 per cent in all cases where dividends are paid to an Australian resident company which holds directly at least 20 per cent of the capital of the Czech Republic company paying the dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that this new policy will go a long way to meeting the concerns expressed by the Australian business community that Australia's former tax treaty policy of limiting each country's foreign dividend withholding tax to a maximum of 15 per cent was a major disincentive to the repatriation of overseas earnings in the form of dividends to Australian resident shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also believes that the agreement will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and the Czech Republic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreements will enter into force when diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in both countries have been completed. The enactment of this Bill will complete the processes required of Australia for those purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to accurately predict the eventual effect of the agreement on the revenue, but it is not expected to be significant.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Bill 1995 introduces the new customs tariff act to come into effect on the 1st July 1996. The act will replace the Customs Tariff Act 1987 as announced in the context of the government's 1994 white paper, "working nation".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new customs tariff will incorporate some 350 changes to the international convention on the harmonized commodity description and coding system proposed by the World customs organization. Australia became a signatory to the convention in 1987. In 1993, the World customs organization agreed to these changes. Australia is now giving effect to our obligations to align our tariff structure with the international standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also renumber and update the wording of the legal provisions in the current tariff. The bill removes unnecessary tariff splits in schedule 3 and redefines some of the concessional provisions contained in schedule 4.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now outline the changes contained in this bill in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legal provisions of the current act have been amended since 1987 on an ad hoc basis to cater for changes to the treatment accorded goods from certain countries and for other purposes. The new act will consolidate these changes and renumber the provisions. There are also textual changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule one provides a new listing of countries which benefit under the Australian system of tariff preferences for developing countries. In 1991 and 1993 the government decided to phase out the developing country margin of preference for goods produced or manufactured in all except the least developed countries. The new listings within schedule one group these countries according to the tariff treatment which they receive. Overall, the intention of these amendments is to retain the existing provisions of the current act but to present them in a more logical and orderly sequence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule three presents the list of customs classification and duty rates applicable to goods. It is in this schedule that the three hundred and fifty changes recommended by the World customs organization occur. The changes reflect differing patterns in international trade and technological developments. Their aim is to regroup like products in the same subheadings and to correct anomalies which have become apparent in the harmonized system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has tried to maintain existing duty rates wherever possible. To maintain the existing levels some additional 200 national splits were created in the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one case, that relating to snowboard boots, local industry and importers have defined the essential characteristics of the boots for a tariff precedent. This will allay concerns that other boots, which are now dutiable, could enter duty free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In only five cases have duty rates not been preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of duty for graded and ungraded pearls, whether or not strung for the convenience of transport, will be free, in line with current practice. Graded pearls are sold, according to accepted international practice, as `temporarily strung for transport purposes'. As Australia currently has a duty on strung pearls, but not on those unstrung, Australian industry practice has been to import the pearls unstrung. This will no longer be required from the 1st July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The duty rate for waste and scrap of batteries will be set at free. While this does not reflect the existing rate for waste of mercury and lithium batteries, it is supported by industry. They have advised that there are no imports of such waste and scrap into Australia nor are there any plans to do so in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tyre cord fabrics of woven glass fibres and other woven fabrics of glass will be combined in new subheadings.There have been no imports from developing countries over the last five years of these tyre cord fabrics. The duty rate for developing countries will therefore be that applying to other woven fabrics of glass.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has not been possible to identify separately the specific goods which transfer between subheadings in 2 instances: food preparations containing cocoa and input or output units for computers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The World Customs Organization has altered the basis of the calculation of cocoa content for certain food preparations. As such it has not been possible to identify separately the specific food preparations which are transferring to an existing subheading. The duty rate proposed reflects the rate of the predominant proportion of trade, some 92 percent, within the expanded subheading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Input or output units (for computers), for example keyboards and printers, from five existing subheadings are combining into one new subheading. The proposed duty rate will reflect the rate applicable to ninety eight percent of the total trade in those subheadings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some national splits in tariff subheadings have been proposed that may eventually prove to be unnecessary because there is no trade. These subheadings will be examined when adequate statistics become available. If the situation so requires, proposals will be brought forward to close-up the subheadings whose tariff splits are serving no purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the implementation of the Customs tariff act 1995, administrative arrangements will be established within the department of industry, science and technology and the Australian Customs service whereby aggrieved parties, including our trading partners, may raise concerns if anomalous situations arise in the context of the government's decision to preserve the duty arrangements. The appeal period will extend from the 1st July 1996 to the thirtieth of june 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I now draw your attention to amendments to schedule 4 of the customs tariff bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4 contains the list of concessional provisions. The three key changes proposed relate to items 17, 18 and 20, which are all re-import provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 17 allows for goods that have been exported from Australia, other than for repair and renovation, to re-enter Australia without being penalised by having to pay duty a second time if their identity has not been altered. It was intended that under this item goods are returned in an unaltered condition, and have not been subject to treatment, industrial processing, repair, renovation, alteration or any other process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has become apparent, however, that the current wording of the item allows its use for wider purposes. For instance, some goods are re-entering Australia after undergoing industrial processing in another country. The amendments are intended to ensure that item 17 cannot be used where any industrial processing has been undertaken overseas before re-importation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 18 permits goods or parts of goods to re-enter Australia duty free in accordance with the provisions of a specific warranty. The changes in item 18c will extend these provisions to goods subject to a global recall for safety or related reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 20 permits the re-entry of goods sent overseas for repair and renovation, but requires that duty be paid on the value of the repair or renovation. These provisions will be retained as the new item 20a. Item 20b contains a new concessional provision. International best practice for repair and renovation dictates that for many purposes, batch repair be undertaken. This means that the faulty product is swapped with an identical unit already repaired. The good sent for repair is then stored until sufficient numbers of the same product have accumulated for economical repair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present operation of item 20, companies are being charged duty on the full value of the items exchanged under such arrangements, rather than on the value of the repairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia needs to recognise the move internationally to batch repair processing. The new item 20b, with related by-law, will allow companies to enter into agreements with Customs to introduce batch repair arrangements without penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The by-law arrangements will be similar to those applying to the tariff export concessions or texco scheme, on goods which the company will send overseas for batch repair, prior to re-importation. The new item 20b by-law will permit companies to take advantage of batch repair process arrangements whilst allowing Customs to ensure compliance concerns are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once a company has such an agreement and is registered, it will be able to use the by-law. Companies will need to retain documentation demonstrating that they are meeting the provisions of the by-law. Customs will employ risk management techniques to ensure that the government's policy intent is being met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as proposals to modify items 17, 18 and 20 a number of administrative changes to a range of other schedule 4 items are proposed. These changes are minor, and will improve the administration of the schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed changes include the rationalisation of numbering to fill unused items, and the splitting of items where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the previous items had coverage of two or more types of goods and it has been difficult to issue specific by-laws for these goods. These have been split into separate items to facilitate their administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A summary of amendments contained in this bill has been prepared and circulated to honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned till the first day of sitting in the 1996 sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 (the act) to implement budget decisions to increase student places and research funding. The costs of these initiatives will be offset by the reallocation of existing discretionary funds, reduction of pipeline places for Victoria, and refinements to the higher education contribution scheme (HECS).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 federal budget decisions reflected in this bill demonstrate clearly that the government is maintaining its commitment to the development of a high quality and accessible higher education system. They also confirm the government's ongoing policy of no up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. They strengthen the government's commitment to HECS as the mechanism whereby Australian undergraduate students make an equitable contribution to the cost of their education. The changes in HECS build on the essential features of the scheme and bring forward revenue which will assist growth of the higher education sector without increasing the size of any student's HECS debt or reducing the thresholds at which repayments must commence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act sets out maximum amounts for grants to institutions. This bill amends the act to reflect changes in expenditure as a result of the budget initiatives to provide new places, additional research funds and the carry-forward of quality funds. The bill includes funding for 1997 and 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide funding for 5,850 new higher education places, plus pipeline, in the years 1996-1998. These places will go to states with strong population growth and currently low participation rates. Queensland will be the major beneficiary of these new places; New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia will also receive some places. The higher education budget package provides for funding of growth in other states in 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian government has previously expressed fears that as many as 10,000 higher education places would be redistributed from Victoria to other states to address growing differences in higher education participation rates and population growth. The provision of extra places to Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia has, however, been achieved without any reduction in the existing funding level or number of places at any university. There will be a minor reallocation of some of the growth anticipated in Victoria, but Victorian institutions will still experience small increases in both funds and places and participation and access rates in Victoria will remain significantly higher than in any other state until at least 2003.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the act also increase the total funds available for research infrastructure to about $293m over the 1996-98 triennium. This represents an additional $109m for research infrastructure. This reflects the government's consistent view that an adequate research infrastructure is crucial for universities to maintain their research and research training capacity at internationally competitive levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide an additional $40m for competitive research grants to assist the nation to maintain and strengthen its research capabilities and to enhance the contribution made by research and scientific development to national economic and social goals. This funding will be made available through the Australian Research Council and is on top of the $350m already committed for these purposes over the 1996-98 triennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a welcome boost to opportunities available for outstanding research students. From 1996 there will be an extra 100 Australian postgraduate awards on top of the 1600 already available. In addition there will be 5 new postdoctoral fellowships making a total of 55 from 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments establish the higher education innovations program. This program amalgamates the national priority (reserve) fund and the quality assurance program. The higher education innovations program will continue to provide incentives to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education as well as provide funding for specific innovative projects of national priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the initiatives outlined are achieved without any net additional expenditure and without introducing up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vital element in this package is a set of refinements to HECS which bring forward revenue but do not increase the size of an individual's HECS debt. It is only by making these changes that the government is able to deliver substantial improvements in the higher education sector without recourse to the easy, but fiscally irresponsible, course of increasing overall government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such refinement introduces an extra incentive for early repayment of HECS debts by allowing a 15 per cent discount on voluntary payments of $500 or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative introduces a voluntary option whereby HECS debtors can elect to repay their debt at a lower threshold and receive a 10 per cent discount. If HECS debtors elect to take up the option, they will make a commitment to repay their accumulated HECS debt at 2 per cent of assessable income when they are above a specified threshold ($20,000 in 1995-96), but below the first compulsory threshold ($27,674 in 1995-96). Their outstanding HECS debt will then be reduced by 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change will not be mandatory. A person choosing to take up the offer will lodge an election form with the Australian taxation office which will `trigger' the discount and repayments when the person falls within the specified income range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives build on the essential features of the HECS scheme. They not only benefit the commonwealth through earlier repayment of HECS debts, but provide a significant benefit to the HECS debtor by introducing discounts in the size of their HECS debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has created a more flexible, accessible and dynamic higher education system and is committed to introducing policies that make further improvements. The government, however, believes that its policies for access to publicly-funded higher education should meet, first and foremost, the needs of Australian citizens and those who have demonstrated a long term commitment to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with this, the act amends the HECS provisions so that new Zealand citizens, and Australian permanent residents of three years standing or more who have not become Australian citizens, pay their HECS contributions up-front at enrolment. They will also have no further access to the open learning deferred payment scheme (OLDPS). Those students who have had their application for citizenship approved by the department of immigration and ethnic affairs, may continue to defer their HECS and OLDPS contributions. This will ensure that students who have had a citizenship application approved but who may have to wait some months to attend a citizenship conferral ceremony will not be financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with other changes to HECS, the revenue brought forward as a result of this change will be used to fund additional higher education student places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discount on mandatory up-front HECS payments is removed by these amendments. Under HECS, students who pay their contribution up-front at enrolment receive a discount of 25 per cent on their payment. This provides an incentive to pay up-front. This is not appropriate for those students who are precluded from deferring their contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure relates to the provision of HECS exemption scholarships for teachers. These scholarships were introduced in 1989 to support a greater degree of professional development among teachers. Since that time the government has introduced a new, more flexible $60m national professional development program which addresses much the same objectives. As a result of this initiative, and in light of the priority to provide additional undergraduate opportunities, the $4.8m previously allocated to teacher HECS exemption scholarships will be reallocated to help create student places. In future, commonwealth support for the professional development of teachers will be provided solely through the national professional development program. As the scholarship program will cease from the end of 1995, there will be no need for a provision in the act exempting scholarship holders from HECS liability and the act will be amended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently under HECS there are three rates of repayment&mdash;3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent of taxable income&mdash;depending on the debtor's level of taxable income. As part of the 1995 budget, the government is introducing four additional repayment rates of 3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent, 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent of HECS repayment income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent rates are intermediate repayment rates and operate in a range between existing threshold levels. The 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent rates are additional repayment rates, being set above the existing maximum threshold level. These additional repayment thresholds will return revenue to the commonwealth at a faster rate without increasing the size of the HECS debt for individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to the act also redefines taxable income for HECS assessment purposes. From 1 July 1996, if a HECS debtor's taxable income has been reduced by a net rental loss (commonly referred to as "negative gearing"), then for HECS assessment purposes the amount of rental loss claimed will be added to the debtor's taxable income. For income earned in the income year 1996-97 and in subsequent income years, HECS assessable income will be used to determine whether or not a HECS debtor is required to make a compulsory repayment against their HECS debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a principle underlying HECS that students in publicly-funded higher education places should be expected to make a contribution towards the cost of their tuition when, and only when, they have the financial capacity to do so. It is the government's intention that, by instituting this budget measure, those with the financial capacity to repay their HECS debt but who are in a position to minimise their income by claiming rental loss in their individual tax return, will no longer be able to avoid making repayments of their HECS contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I stress that this bill presents a very tightly integrated package of measures which provides for growth in student places where they are needed, enhances research funds and postgraduate scholarships, does not alter the fundamental elements of HECS nor require reallocation of any existing student places, and does not increase overall government outlays. This package, or "cocktail" as it became known in the higher education sector, was developed following extensive consultation with the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated at the time the budget was handed down, any attempt to unravel this package or to introduce amendments which reduce revenue raising aspects will mean that the government is forced to reconsider its announcement of additional places allocated to Queensland, New South Wales, western Australia and Tasmania. Alternatively, the government will have to consider the reallocation of existing places from other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this package, mr speaker, the government has responded positively and quickly to the resource needs of the higher education sector with both new policy and effective savings without cutting the overall funds available to higher education.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking in continuation in relation to the Greens' amendments Nos 11 and 12, which concern the manufacture and import of products. The current wording is for products that contain or use scheduled substances. While it is testable whether a product contains a substance, it is difficult to determine whether it uses a substance, especially where there are various products, some scheduled and some not, designed to replace each other with little or no modification of equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>

In relation to amendments Nos 11 and 12, the intention of the amendments is to prohibit products designed to use scheduled products. The amendments would take effect immediately and would mean that even equipment originally designed to use CFCs but capable of in fact using an alternative would be prohibited. The government does not consider this to be an effective and efficient use of existing equipment and, in addition, we are confident that with adequate public education there will be sufficient incentives for designers to avoid designing equipment which will soon be obsolete. I also make the additional point in relation to amendment No. 13 that, in relation to regulation-making powers, the government considers that under the proposed amendments there is sufficient power to set at a future date controls on HCFCs and methyl bromide products for users, so I indicate that the government will not be supporting these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I want to make a brief comment in relation to Senator Kemp';s comments. Our previous amendments dealt with the design of products. These amendments deal with the products themselves. Whilst they may seem technical and they may seem complicated, they are definitely improvements to the legislation and have been discussed with people who are very familiar with these matters and who feel that it is a logical and a consistent way for the legislation to approach design and production. The reason is that it is looking practically at how industry can best approach our ozone protection regime. In that case, we should give them every direction possible for certainty and consistency in the way in which we approach it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 15 to 22 have the effect of stopping the use of all scheduled substances in various products including aerosol cans, dry cleaning, disposable containers and various foams. We should note that, for the most part, industry no longer uses scheduled products in these applications. For example, aerosol cans now almost exclusively use hydrocarbon propellants. There is no reason to allow manufacturers to start using substances such as HCFCs or, indeed, HFCs&mdash;the hydrofluorocarbons. Stopping HFC use was part of the original intent of this amendment. If we did not stop them we would be moving backwards environmentally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although that was the original intent, it makes no difference to these amendments since they simply change phases like phase 1 and phase 2 substances to any scheduled substances. This has the effect of explicitly including in the restriction the HBFCs, HCFCs and methyl bromide. I cannot imagine anyone wanting to use those substances, with the possible exception of HCFCs, in any application covered here. As a result, I can see no problem in implementing this. This relates specifically to amendments 15 to 22. I want to go through each amendment in turn because they relate to different products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 15 relates to dry cleaning equipment. The amendment prohibits the use of all scheduled substances. Currently the act prohibits the use of schedule 1 parts I, II, III and IV only. Dry cleaning does not currently appear to commonly use any scheduled substance, thus ensuring that it is clear that dry cleaning does not use such substances and should have no impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 16 and 17 relate to disposable or non-refillable containers for, respectively, auto airconditioning maintenance kits and refrigerants generally. Disposable containers and kits are generally for backyard type applications and servicing, and work against recycling and monitoring. That is why they were banned in the first place. This would explicitly extend that ban to other scheduled substances, particularly the HCFCs which are the only substances likely to be affected by this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia the Motor Trades Association has been complaining for years about the lack of inspection and enforcement of state law regarding ozone depleting substances. The association complains that many backyard mechanics and body shops do not recycle but vent gases to air. The recycling equipment is expensive and there is a significant labour component to recycling, making vent to air a much cheaper option. Just in case senators think we are being technical here, all that `vent to air' means is that you take the equipment out of the refrigerator or the airconditioner and just let it go into the air. It is not a technical term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with price competition from unscrupulous mechanics, those who did the right thing and bought recycling equipment found that they could not afford to use it because they were competing with people who were not doing the right thing. Current concerns by the same group&mdash;which were voiced by my colleague Jim Scott in the upper house of the state parliament&mdash;are that licences to deal with CFCs do not apply to many of the alternatives. This means that an unlicensed mechanic can vent CFCs to air and replace them with HFCs. While enforcement of state law and conditions and the application of licences are a state affair, disposable kits will certainly make it more difficult to regulate. This was the rationale behind the original restriction regarding CFCs. Our amendment would stop the use of these kits for HCFCs and HBFCs. It would also cover the use of methyl bromide, but this is not used as a refrigerant or airconditioning substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 19 concerns aerosols. We really do not want to see HCFCs or other environmentally destructive products promoted to this application as the chemical industry is trying to do. Hydrocarbons are already the industry standard, and that is what we should be working towards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 18 covers polystyrene packaging and insulation; amendment 20 covers rigid polyurethane foam; and amendment 21 covers flexible polyurethane foam. Basically there is no longer any excuse for using any scheduled substance as a foam blowing agent. Most foam blowing in OECD countries is done using cyclopentanes or other hydrocarbons because they are cheaper, have less environmental impact, and are generally safer in an occupational safety sense during manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would have an impact on developing nations where the World Bank has assisted in the establishment of plants using HCFCs as foam blowing agents. It is generally accepted that HCs are cheaper and safer foam blowing agents. Even the World Bank is starting to rethink its position. I believe all Australian refrigerator manufacturers now use hydrocarbon foams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to amendment 22, I have to say that I am not sure why schedule 4 proposed clause 9 was included without deleting existing clause 3, since they are virtually identical. I call this anomaly to the attention to the minister and suggest that either clause 3 or clause 9 should be deleted. The major difference is that clause 3 includes all part I, II, III and IV substances, though only part I substances&mdash;that is CFCs&mdash;are used as refrigerants. Clause 9 says that it only applies to CFCs and not to HCFCs or HBFCs. Clause 3 may be a bit more specific and applies only to containers of five kilos or less. Clause 9 has no weight limit and only applies to products consisting wholly of disposable containers. Proposed clause 9 covers products that are wholly or partly disposable containers. Our amendment applied to clause 9 would effectively result in a restriction in relation to HCFCs and HBFCs as well as CFCs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend our amendments 15 to 22 as being a simple statement of restriction in relation to all scheduled substances, instead of naming some and not others, on the assumption that those not named specifically will not be used. A general statement in relation to scheduled substances covers everything, allows consistency, and would cover any new substances added&mdash;as HBFCs have been added this year. If the government and the coalition will not support our amendments I ask that they specify for the record what they will do to meet the legitimate concerns on these issues and limit the amount of new equipment using scheduled substances that are manufactured or imported. </PARA>

I might say also that methyl bromide is not used in any of these particular products. The product bans proposed in Senator Chamarette's amendments are an unnecessarily blunt instrument to encourage the phase out of HCFCs. The government's legislative proposals provide for a sophisticated program that winds back the supply of HCFCs ahead of the Montreal Protocol requirements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment No. 23 refers specifically to domestic refrigerators and splits them off from commercial or industrial refrigerators and commercial, industrial or domestic airconditioning equipment. Domestic refrigeration has not wholly adopted hydrocarbon technologies, but is rapidly doing so. This amendment says that no scheduled substances should be used by 1998. Given that most developed world companies no longer use scheduled substances for foam blowing and most are converting to non-scheduled refrigerants or have done so, particularly the EC, this should not be a problem in Australia. The US has problems in this area because cyclic defrost machines are harder to design for hydrocarbons, but even the United States' industry is converting. Commercial and industrial chillers using some HCFCs are very efficient and alternatives have not been available, although at least one large chain, I think Coles, has converted to chillers refrigerated with ammonia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestic airconditioning uses HCFCs and there are currently few commercial alternatives. Nonetheless, the CEPA suggested privately in a discussion that it would be helpful to set a cut-off date for new HCFC equipment at 1998. This would ensure that industry is not locked into the extended use of a substance that is being phased out&mdash;a particularly important measure since commercial and industrial refrigeration and airconditioning equipment is expensive and has a normal lifetime of 20 years or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The phase-out of HCFCs would ensure that there is gas to continue to service a limited amount of existing equipment, but we should make certain that there is as little of such equipment as possible to service. This amendment does that for HCFCs and also HFCs. Since we have failed to have a new part 8 included to cover HFCs, I will ask that reference to this part in our amendment be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another new class of product, vehicle airconditioners, has been included. Auto airconditioning is a contentious issue in relation to HFCs versus hydrocarbons, but it is likely that hydrocarbons can either be used safely now, as indicated in the Little report that has just been released, or can be made safe to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two possible safety measures are: firstly, a pressure sensor attached to an alarm which would go off if pressure dropped below a certain level, which is effective for slow or sudden leaks; or, secondly, assuring adequate ventilation in the passenger compartment so that a sudden total release of refrigerant into the compartment would disperse beyond the point of flammability within 30 seconds when standing still with the windows closed. One study shows the average modern car is designed with sufficient ventilation for dispersal within 50 seconds. I think this is the answer to the question Senator Kemp raised earlier.

<PARA>I would like to get the minister's comments on amendment No. 1 before going on to Nos 2 and 3. The amendments on page 3956 relate to the accelerated phase-out of HCFCs and methol bromide. The first amendment, which relates to schedule 1, page 8, says that no licences for use of methol bromide will extend past 30 June 2001. The USA is currently pushing for this limit and is suggesting a trade restriction penalising products produced using methol bromide. Methol bromide is used as an agricultural fumigant. It is an ozone depleting substance and a greenhouse gas. It differs from CFCs and other gases because it is routinely released to the atmosphere in use. It is used as a fumigant because it can kill virtually anything in soil. But aside from its impact on the ozone layer and on global warming, killing everything in the soil is not a good agricultural practice. A great deal of what is in the soil is very valuable in agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rhizobium, a soil fungus, is responsible for most of the nitrogen fixation in legumes and clovers, and earthworms keep the soil friable. Other micro-organisms and invertebrates work to maintain pH, increase the friability of soil, and repress pathogenic and pest organisms. Soil is created and maintained by these small friends of agriculture, and general poisons destroy them and damage the soil, increasing compaction and the likelihood that the pest organisms gain a foothold. So there are good agricultural reasons to move away from the use of methol bromide and towards integrated and biological pest controls. In any case, there is no clear strategy for phasing out bromide in spite of strong action being taken in other nations. This amendment would set a date for phase-out. If the government rejects this amendment, I would like to know what it plans to do instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments Nos 2 and 3, which work together, accelerate the phase-out of HCFCs. They would terminate their general use by 2010. The accelerated schedule is in line with suggestions in the US and other nations and is the target for phase-outs supported by Greenpeace. Amendment No. 2 relates to the industry limits. Amendment No. 3 relates to the reserve quota. HCFCs have few applications now where there are not commercially available alternatives. Certainly by 2010 there is little reason for continuing manufacture or import of HCFCs, given that they can be recycled and that, if government acts appropriately, new products using them will not be available after 1998. I would like the minister to comment on why the government is not presenting a strategy like this if it does not intend to support the amendments, which confirm phase-outs in relation to methol bromide and also provide some kind of certainty in the legislation which will be for the guidance of industry. </PARA>

All of us are overloaded in this chamber. I know it is very easy to stand up and say all these things, but I urge the senator and her advisers to make sure that, when such complex changes and additions are made to a bill, wider consultation is held so that there may be a possibility of, if not reaching agreement on all of the issues, reaching some agreement in particular areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate part of what both the minister and Senator Kemp have said, which is that these amendments have not been discussed with the industry and do not have agreement. But it is difficult to place into this debate those kinds of arguments and give any force to them if we do not put them on the public record. One could well argue that if these amendments are so technical and my colleagues are as out of their depth as I am&mdash;we are all out of our depth&mdash;they should have been part of the canvassing that was originally done. It is appropriate to put them on the record and to ask that the justification for not having amendments of this kind be put by the minister. He has put that. We accept his arguments. Those who read the debate can judge whether they are convinced that the impact on industry and on consumers is such that we cannot afford to provide certainty to both industry and consumers that there will be a phase-out and provide dates for that phasing out.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is laudable that the government is using it in that form and trying to exceed it, but there is no reason why amendments should not be urging the government to exceed it even further. I accept that the government may not be willing to move in that direction. But I do not see any reason why it should not be challenged during the debate to increase its action in the direction that will satisfy those people who have got the technical expertise and who see it as extremely logical and consistent that we should be trying to work in the same direction as many other countries in the world, particularly OECD countries, to actually increase the certainty and consistency of a regime which eventually will see a total phasing out of ozone depleting substances. </PARA>

I hope that the minister will take on board some of the concerns, and if there are any amendments that he can see a way to consult the industry about, maybe he should seek to do so. My understanding is that the EPA has looked at the amendments and has indicated that there is nothing terrible wrong with them and that there is nothing that could not be very sensibly incorporated in a regime if there were political will.

<PARA>This amendment, which I have under No. 3955, relates to fines rather than imprisonment as penalties, and I put it because it is a habit of mine to remind the chamber that criminal sanctions are a penalty of last resort. I do not believe that they exert a deterrent effect&mdash;and I assure you many criminologists do not either&mdash;and they are an easy way out, where we have failed to support amendments that actually legislate for phasing out. All we are doing is not putting those kinds of requirements in and, instead, increasing penalties which are not likely to be used because the regime we are putting in place is not one that is designed towards phasing out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment relates to three sections; section 62, `False statements'; section 63, `Obstruction of inspectors'; and section 64, `Failure to answer questions'. It eliminates the gaol sentences and replaces them with fines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will be debating for the remainder of the afternoon&mdash;no doubt tomorrow as well&mdash;the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 [No. 2] and the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. These bills have been before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee twice, which is not a bad thing. They have been available for heaven knows how long for everybody to have their say on and, indeed, just about everybody has had their say. I do not say that in a pejorative or condescending sense. It is a good thing when legislation before this parliament is subjected to full and proper scrutiny, to committee consideration, and when interest groups in the community&mdash;from the Law Council in general, the Family Law Council, the national Women's Justice Commission&mdash;and a very wide range of people, have had the opportunity to have some input into this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is not true to say that it will be substantially changed&mdash;I do not believe that is a fair assessment of it&mdash;nonetheless, as a consequence of those committee hearings and of the contributions made by people such as those that I have mentioned, there will be some significant amendments that the government has shown it has been prepared to make, which we will be supporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of contentious issues need to be considered with respect to this bill. I do not want to take all the time available to me now. I believe there are 86 government amendments, so there will be plenty of opportunity to make any points that people need to make. But I would like to touch on a couple of points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the question of the imprisonment of registrars for carelessly or recklessly releasing information. There has to be some distinction, some dividing line, between people who are Family Court judges and judicial registrars. The community is entitled to expect family law matters to be treated confidentially and, where they are not, the community is entitled to expect some serious consequence. I look forward to hearing what the Greens (WA) have to say with respect to that matter. That is one matter on which we would expect in the committee stage to have some significant debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, with respect to parenting plans, there needs to be some teasing out of everbody's positions. There are two strains of thought on agreed parenting plans which, if the government has its way, one can register without having had legal advice and with only some cursory looking at by the court. One school of thought says, `That's a good thing. Half of the problem with the Family Court is the family lawyers.' Plenty of people would say that some family lawyers are driving around in the most modern, hotted-up versions of Mercedes sports cars, Porches and everything else. That may be true of some, but it is not true of all. Plenty of family lawyers take their professional responsibilities very responsibly. In my view, that is an attack generally made by people who are somewhat ill-informed about the issues relating to the high costs of justice. It is just so easy to kick the legal profession and blame them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to put on record the confidence that we have in the legal profession, acknowledging that they have some bad apples as does every other industry&mdash;and, perhaps, Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I could agree that that comment could apply even to us. You and I would not like to be criticised on the basis of a wrongdoing by a member of a federal or state parliament&mdash;the assumption being that we were all the same. I am sure family lawyers fit into that category. They are, after all, operating in a system designed by us and administered by the judges. They do not make the policies; we do. So I wanted to make that view clear, with the rider that there would be some lawyers in the family law jurisdiction, as there would be in any other area, as there would be in any other service industry, that run up costs unnecessarily. But one swallow does not a summer or a spring make. I do not think it is fair to criticise the entire profession on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, those criticisms encourage people to say, `Don't let the lawyers into this. If the husband and wife agree, leave them to it.' The other side says, `Those people that want to come to an agreement and are capable of coming to an agreement without any animosity between them as to these matters, can still do that.' Plenty of them now do. Plenty of them now do not avail themselves of the Family Court at your and my expense, because they can sort it out themselves&mdash;and they have a very flexible arrangement because they have no written agreements. Given that they are getting on but not wanting to be married any more, they can handle changes in their situations with a minimum of fuss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty comes for the parties that cannot do that. The notion here is to let them register these agreements. There is some concern that if these are to be treated as orders of the court, then the court has to have even a cursory scrutiny of the matters contained in the agreement. One cannot imagine this government wanting agreements registered that are not in the best interests of the child. We will settle all that in this debate. Presumably, there must be that cursory look. The real question comes as to whether you will require both parties to have received legal advice prior to the court agreeing to register the agreement as though it were a court order, understanding the court will not move to enforce the orders if there is a breach unless the court then satisfies itself at a later stage that the agreement is in the best interests of the child. I understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if consequences hang on this, if it is something more than just a rubber stamp that the parties are committing themselves to, then there is a serious question to be considered as to the rights of the parties signing the agreement. If nothing hangs on it and it is as though they were one of the couples that make an agreement outside the court, then no-one would worry. But if something hangs on it&mdash;and presumably something does, otherwise this is a very expensive farce that we are going into&mdash;not the least of which are the rights of one or other of the parties and the difficulty and cost in getting the agreement changed where circumstances change and the parties cannot come to an agreement as to how it ought to change, then there is a fair case for saying that someone ought to have some legal advice before they commit themselves to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be interested to hear what Senator Neal has to say in this respect. Rumour has it that she practised as a family lawyer. I have never bothered to check. That may be right. Perhaps those who do not know will find that out in the debate. I will be interested to hear her view as to whether women, who are traditionally seen as being in the least powerful position, would benefit from having advice before they put their name at the bottom of one of these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plenty of people, especially in times of stress, such as when a marriage is breaking up and decisions are being made as to what to do with the children, do not necessarily think as far down the track as they might want to. Just like people who want to make a will think of it in terms of the assets that they now have, the children that they now have, the friends that they now have, and if you let them draft one themselves, they would probably make a botch of it in effectively distributing their assets in accordance with their wishes under the changed circumstances. That is why sensible people get legal advice before they knock up a will and do not go to the local stationary shop and pick up some model form and write in a few assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry, Senator Neal, you were on the phone at the time, but the particular point on which I am interested in knowing your view and the view of the Greens&mdash;I think know the view of the Australian Democrats in this matter&mdash;is whether the parties should have to have some sort of legal advice before we allow them to register an agreed parenting plan on the basis that it is often the women who are in the least powerful position in these negotiations, the least capable of getting advice, if they want to argue for more time with the kids at Christmas or on holidays or whatever, the least able to pay for that advice and the least likely to have the power to influence the other party and, therefore, most likely to sign an agreement that on reflection and with advice they would not have signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: what happens when a woman in such a position, in the least powerful position, has been hoodwinked into signing an agreement that, on reflection or after legal advice, she realises she should not have signed? What cost is she then put to in setting aside those agreements if the other party is not in such a conciliatory position six, nine or 12 months or two years down the track when situations change? For example, when a woman who has been working part time then suddenly works full time, her former spouse might think that changes the situation; or when one party's income changes drastically one way or the other, the other party might think that changes the situation as to what they can do with the children. There is a whole range of things that could change over a period of time and that parties might best be advised about before they sign those agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to conclude that there are consequences and that they are expensive for parties to change, but I look forward to the minister's view on that. If he wants to say, `Look there is nothing in this. This is just to make people feel better. We've got a Family Court stamp here. Let's go whack, whack, whack. They can rip it up any time they like and walk away from it any time they like', then people might feel a bit more comfortable. But if that is not the case, then I suspect that Senator Neal and Senator Crowley&mdash;all the women on that side&mdash;would be particularly concerned at allowing a situation to develop where the least powerful party to the negotiations can enter into a negotiation, come to an agreement, have it registered as though it is a court order and then be faced with quite exceptional expense from that person's point of view in terms of setting it aside. That would defeat one of the purposes that I would have thought women in the Labor Party would be arguing very strongly in favour of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> They are the main issues which we will seek to discuss in the committee stage of this bill. I just want to add that I do understand there are plenty of people in the community who think these changes are inappropriate. Some of them are the people who think anything is inappropriate. As soon as you attach the Family Court to it, they are unhappy with it in any event. Others have different ideas about how we ought to fix the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to this bill from this perspective: we understand there is no-one who thinks it is working perfectly at the moment&mdash;not that I have come across, anyway. While those who are critical of the changes in this bill would say, `They just amount to a lot of schmalzy word changing: custody is custody. Dress it up as something else if you want', I think they are perhaps looking in hope for some improvement. If they are right in their description of these things as being nothing more than schmalzy word changes, I would suggest that, if it at least engenders a different attitude to the parenting of children following separation and if it in any way reduces the animosity and bitterness that are so prevalent at the moment when one party gets custody and the other does not, it will be a good thing. If the changes we make here&mdash;to the best of my knowledge I do not think anyone will vote against the bill if they do not get the amendments that they want&mdash;make a difference to that over a period of time, it will be a good thing. For that reason, we will be supporting the bill, whether the changes we would like to see made to it are made or not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 [No. 2] and the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. The Family Law Reform Bill was introduced to implement in part certain recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act 1975 but, in many respects, it goes well beyond the recommendations of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key aims of the bill is to facilitate the greater use of mediation, counselling and arbitration in the resolution of family law disputes, both inside and outside the court process. Another major aim of the bill is to restructure part 7, dealing with children, by introducing new concepts and terminology and by emphasising parental responsibilities rather than parental rights. The bill removes references to traditional concepts of custody and access and introduces the new concepts of joint parenting and parental responsibility in providing residence and contact. The government has also introduced the concept of parenting plans, whereby the parents are encouraged to make maintenance provisions regarding the welfare of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the Australian Democrats welcome this bill as a major step forward in the family law area. However, we have a number of concerns with the bill as it is presently drafted. To begin with, we do not believe that the bill sufficiently ensures that court officials, lawyers, counsellors, mediators, arbitrators and others are sensitive to certain factors in the situation or history of the separating couple when selecting or utilising alternative dispute resolution options, or primary dispute resolution options as they are called in the bill. The Democrats believe that it is completely inappropriate for people to be forced into primary dispute resolution methods where there is a history or risk of domestic violence, child abuse or a serious imbalance in the bargaining power of the parties. As has been said by Senator Vanstone, it is usually the woman who is disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are therefore proposing to insert guidelines into the bill to make it clear that there are times when primary dispute resolution methods are not a suitable option for the parties. It is important, we believe, to have these guidelines in the bill&mdash;in other words, to have the bill transparent as to what is meant and what the options are&mdash;and that the pressure on the separating couple is not such that they are pushed into decisions which are possibly not in their best interests. While it might be argued, and I am sure it will be, by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) that elegant drafting does not make provision for repetitious assurances of that type, we believe that we should make every piece of legislation accessible to people who are going to be governed by their provisions. We trust that the government and the opposition will bring a positive feeling to the amendments that I will be moving on behalf of the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are also unhappy with the government's proposal to extend the immunity from suit presently enjoyed by approved mediators and arbitrators to private mediators. The government is proposing to provide immunity to these private mediators, despite there being no comprehensive system of regulation or accreditation in place. Understandably, this proposal received much criticism by witnesses appearing before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. As the Chair of the Family Services Council, Ms Bagshaw, stated in her evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . because it is an absolute privilege, it can be seen as a powerful protection for the mediator and not always in the client's best interests. It should therefore not be lightly given in the absence of satisfactory regulatory framework for private family mediation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will be moving amendments that prevent the extension of the immunity to private mediators and arbitrators, at least until a satisfactory system of accreditation and approval is in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also not satisfied with the objects of part 7 of the bill dealing with children. Presently, this section appears to suggest that parental responsibility is the paramount consideration, but it does not emphasise the need to prevent family violence. We will therefore be moving amendments to confirm the importance of the child's best interests in the part of the bill dealing with children and to make more visible the need to ensure safety from family violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most radical aspects of the bill is the removal of references to custody and access, and the introduction of the new terminology which includes residence, contact and special purpose orders. The Democrats understand that this is designed to break the automatic nexus between custody and the responsibility for the daily care and control of the child but believe that it does so in a way that is extremely confusing. We will therefore be introducing amendments that provide a definition of `parental responsibility' which is more descriptive and more easily understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also seriously concerned at the lack of scrutiny of parenting plans. This is an area that Senator Vanstone adverted to. The Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee specifically recommended that parenting plans should be scrutinised by the court before registration. Unfortunately, however, the government specifically rejected this argument, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major thrust of the reforms is to allow parents greater opportunity for deciding what arrangements will be made in respect of their children and/or encouraging greater use of non-litigious dispute resolution mechanisms in settling arrangements where agreement cannot be reached.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no problem with that objective and the Democrats wholeheartedly support it. However, there is a problem when this reasoning ignores the fact that five per cent or so of divorces ending up in the Family Court do so because parties are manifestly unable to resolve their differences without some third party assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even where cases do not reach that stage in the court process but are encouraged to reach agreement, we must be certain that they do not reach an agreement that affects their children and how they are being cared for in a trade-off for financial or other advantages in the settlement of property disputes. We must get away from the concept that children are chattels and that parents are able to dispose of them as they wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does remain, in our view, a responsibility for the court to ensure that the welfare of the child is a paramount consideration at all times. The Democrats will therefore be amending these provisions to ensure that parenting plans can be registered by the court if the agreement is signed by both parties, if it is certified by the legal practitioner who has provided advice on the plan and if the court is satisfied that the arrangements set out in the agreement or plan are likely to promote the best interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that these suggestions have been debated at some length before the committee and that the government has, on numerous occasions, advised that it thinks these provisions would involve the application of resources which are beyond the resources available to the court. I believe that that should not be the paramount consideration. We must first ask the question, `What must we do to ensure the best interests of the child?' The act enjoins us to do that. Then we look at the resources and how best it can be done efficiently and cost effectively. Scrutiny by the court is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the other argument is that it is still possible for the court to become involved at the time of one of the parties seeking to enforce an agreement and, in those few cases, that is the time where action should be taken&mdash;and that is sufficient. I do not believe that that is a full answer to the concern I am raising because quite clearly many agreements will be concluded and be in force. They will be handled by the parties as an obligation without getting to the point of wanting to go to court to have it enforced and to get the court involved. We must ensure that the court does not renege on its responsibilities as far as the children in a divorce are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also somewhat unhappy with the provisions that threaten criminal sanctions against registrars who intentionally or recklessly disclose information. This provision was strongly criticised by the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Mr Justice Nicholson, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The penalty is both unnecessary and objectionable. The Court objects strongly to it and points out that such a sanction is found nowhere else in the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity in which registrars will often deal with this type of information is in the exercise of delegated judicial power and it is particularly inappropriate that those with such power be liable to a criminal sanction arising out [of] its exercise.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate committee also recommended that the provision which allows for the imprisonment of registrars be deleted. We certainly believe that it is an overreaction to a situation that must certainly be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be moving an amendment to the bill to make it mandatory for the Family Court to order separate legal representation for children where a couple with children comes before the court. The discretionary nature of the existing regime and the absence of easy access to legal advice for children do not satisfy either the general principle that all human beings are autonomous individuals, regardless of age, or the provisions of this act that state that the welfare of the child shall be of paramount importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' amendment is similar to what is the current position in New Zealand where it is mandatory for the court to appoint a barrister or solicitor to represent a child who is not already represented. That has been in force in New Zealand for several years. I have not yet heard that the family court in New Zealand has gone broke or that the exchequer has. The argument that this would be too costly for us to introduce should be rejected. If New Zealand can do it, I really do not see why we cannot have a similar measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to recognise the contribution made by some people to the work put into this bill. I must first express appreciation to Judy Harrison of the National Women's Justice Coalition. Over weeks and months she has tirelessly scrutinised the bill and its provisions and has made numerous suggestions for improvements to the bill. In addition, I need to mention a solicitor who has had extensive experience as a community and family lawyer in India, Vandana Herur. She has worked in our office on a voluntary basis on this bill and has with great patience and diligence contributed to the work that has been carried out in my office. She has provided much assistance in helping to develop the Democrats response to the bill. I would like to place on record my appreciation for the considerable work that she has done and that Judy Harrison has done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the family law bills that are before the Senate. I would like to make a few preliminary comments about the overall philosophy of the Family Law Act and the Labor government's role in changing family law in Australia. The Labor government has always been at the forefront of law reform, particularly in relation to family law. In 1975, the Labor government introduced the Family law Act after two aborted attempts in 1973 and 1974, and changed the fundamental principles upon which disputes arising from family breakdown are resolved. The act removed the basis of fault in divorce proceedings where often property and children had become the gifts of the victor. Prior to the changes of 1975, children were often very much regarded as property&mdash;or at least pseudoproperty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting historical quirk that the then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, when he introduced the bill, although he envisaged that fault would no longer be applicable in family law proceedings, did not positively state this within the legislation. This caused slight confusion and for a couple of years minor fault factors were taken into account in the Family Court when determining property settlements. It was finally ultimately resolved that fault, except as it directly affected the financial resources of families, would not be taken into account at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act looked towards the future benefit of the family and the individual members. The proceedings were refocused on reaching an arrangement to allow each member of the family to proceed with their lives rather than establishing who had been at fault in the breakdown of the marriage. It is probably an appropriate time to acknowledge the far-sightedness and innovation of those legislators who took steps to change the basis of family law. The old system had operated since civilian courts took over family law from the ecclesiastical courts in 1857. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments before the Senate are aimed at furthering the philosophy of the original bill. There are two major areas of reform: firstly, the orders relating to children; and, secondly, the enhancement of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in dealing with family law disputes. I was very involved, particularly in the second hearing of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, with this bill. Even though, as Senator Spindler has stated, there were substantial concerns and suggestions as to possible amendments to the bill, the overwhelming majority of witnesses who appeared before us were very much in favour of the thrust of the reform bill and were glad to see it come before this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will firstly deal with amendments as they relate to children. Part VII of the act sets out the regime for the making of orders in relation to children. The objects of this section are set out in proposed section 60B. This very much focuses on the needs of the children and their rights and expectations. The principle that a court must regard the best interests of the children as a paramount consideration is clearly stated in section 65, confirming what has been the state of the law for some years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main shift in the amending bill is to change the emphasis from parental rights in relation to children of the marriage towards parental responsibility. This is the most valuable part of the bill. It confronts an emphasis that I do not believe has been in the interests of children and, ultimately, of parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued that the demise of fault provisions as a basis for divorce has called parties to in some cases seek another outlet to assert who carries the blame for the family breakdown. This may be seen through the contest involving property division and sometimes, unfortunately, who is `victorious'&mdash;I use that term very guardedly&mdash;in being awarded custody of the children. Section 61 of the act clearly states the responsibility of a parent towards the child, notwithstanding a change in their circumstances or a change to the family with regard to the relationship between the parents. The bill carries further this principle by altering the terminology as it relates to parents and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concepts of custody and access are abandoned. The court may make orders in four ways. The first is called residence orders. In some regards, they are similar to custody orders but do not go so far. They do not deal with the complete care and control of the child. The second type of order is the contact order, which in some parts is similar to what is now known as access orders. Child maintenance orders are fairly self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final creature, the special purpose order, is a completely new creature of this legislation. It allows a flexibility that was not provided before. It abandons the situation where one parent has almost total care and control of the child and the other parent is involved only briefly through access visits and the payment of maintenance. It straitjacketed people in the past into trying to get their family to fit into a largely uniform and predetermined regime which was often unsatisfactory for all parties concerned, particularly the children. This terminology recognises the unique nature of each child and family and encourages the parties to make individual orders crafted particularly for their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This division also provides for the registration of parenting plans. It in fact encourages them. Parents can sit down together and work out what best suits them and their children rather than there being a situation where standard custody is granted to one parent and access is granted every second weekend to the other, which is presently commonplace. The plans can provide, for example&mdash;these are only examples&mdash;for a child to stay three days at one house and four at another or spend one year at one parent's home and alternate years at the other's. It can provide for religious or cultural instruction that the child is to receive, the type of diet that should be provided, the type and level of education, the relationship with step-parents and siblings and the type of discipline applied to the child. Alternatively, it can be just a one-line, wide open and completely flexible statement about the parents' philosophy. The details can be left to be worked out as the parents see fit from day to day. The only restriction is the overriding principle that the children's interests be paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also particularly deals with contact orders in a  situation of domestic violence. The bill clearly directs that the court must not make contact orders that are inconsistent with apprehended domestic violence orders that have been made in the state courts. Further, the orders they make in relation to children should not expose parties to a risk of domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some suggestion by Senator Vanstone in her comments as they related to children and parenting orders that somehow the motivation for this bill was to ensure that lawyers and, in particular, family lawyers were removed from the process. It certainly is not my intention and I do not believe the intention of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) or the government to take steps to ensure that family lawyers are not involved. In my view, at the risk of being self-serving with regard to my former career, it is not a major difficulty in ensuring that parents can work out arrangements that are best suited to them and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of these sort of orders is to allow them the flexibility to do what suits them, not to ensure that lawyers are not trying to rip them off or spend more time on continuing litigation when it is unnecessary. This bill is trying to say that parents are responsible to their children. They do not have rights in relation to the children. The rights are all with the children. They must work out with each other where they can what is in their best interest. They must recognise that this will be an ongoing regime that will continue. They have to work with each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with proceedings in court is that, as well as being expensive and inconvenient for the parties involved, the delicate and tentative relationship that often exists between parents after a family breakdown and which must continue for the ongoing care of the children is further damaged. In my view, the aspects of the bill that deal with children are particularly directed at preserving that relationship to the extent that that is possible and not to further erode it with ugly court room scenes, confrontation and further unpleasantness between the parties. In my view, this is the essential objective of this aspect of the bill and the latter aspects, which I will go on to deal with. I do not believe the motivation is to ensure that families in a breakdown situation are not ripped off by greedy and, as it might be put, dishonourable members of the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to deal with counselling and mediation, which are set out in parts II, III and IIIA of the bill. It is a fairly well-known fact that 95 per cent of matters in the Family Court are resolved before the hearing. This is a very laudable figure. It shows that parties in many cases are very keen to ensure that they resolve their disputes before they go to a hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parties often do not face up to the necessity to resolve their dispute until they come face to face at the court on the first return date and have the opportunity to face each other, discuss the issues between them and attempt to resolve them. The big advantage of mediation as a first point of dispute resolution is that, before they take the step of commencing proceedings and having a first return and all the various other steps involved before hearing, they get an opportunity to talk to each other in a fairly relaxed atmosphere with a trained third party whose attitude is conducive to a resolution to try to come to what is very popularly described these days as a win-win situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They can put aside the set views that the court may have that do not suit either party in regard to children. They can reach decisions that they are quite happy with and can live with. It may not be the absolutely best solution for either one of them. As a group, they are happier than they would have been, potentially, if the matter had gone to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis that this bill places on mediation is a good thing, despite the potential loss of business in terms of face-to-face litigation for family lawyers. It is very clear that the majority of the profession are very supportive of mediation. Prior to this bill, there had been a gradual increase in the utilisation of informal mediation throughout the profession. The broad scope of views expressed to me within both the court and the profession saw the tendency for mediation as something that could enhance the role of lawyers in that they are left to advise and, if necessary, to litigate in those matters that are most entrenched and are not suited to mediation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with some of the concerns expressed by Senator Spindler in relation to mediation in situations where domestic violence has played a role. Where my view differs is that I feel the bill before the house today allows scope and flexibility so that mediation is not persisted with or is not forced where the circumstance is not appropriate. Very clearly, where there is an existing violent domestic situation or there has been a relationship where domestic violence was a component and one party used their greater power in the relationship to push around the other, mediation is not appropriate and the mediator would assess that and clearly state that before the matter is proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other situations in which mediation may not be applicable. Those matters are assessed by the mediator. There is certainly not going to be a situation where people, in circumstances that are not appropriate, are forced against their will to deal with another party if that is going to cause them difficulty or distress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been somewhat disappointed by the general response of the opposition, which as usual have taken a fairly negative role in this debate. Both Mr Andrews in the House of Representatives and Senator Vanstone in this house have not opposed this bill, but they have not supported it. That is very sad, in light of the general community support for the principles set out in this bill. I suppose it is not inconsistent with their general view at the moment, which is that their best option is to put forward no position and no policy. I hope that, despite that, further speakers will see fit to support the bill. I commend it to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill was introduced into the Senate on 28 November last year and was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on that date. As a result of this and another exposure bill, that committee tabled a first report on 6 March this year, and a second one on 21 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Family Law Act 1975 as a first stage in implementing the government's response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. The main areas it seeks to amend are, firstly, dispute resolution through mediation and provisions relating  to what is traditionally known as custody and access of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I commend to the Senate the two reports I mentioned by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I would have thought that the work done there by senators from the government, Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats and senators from the coalition was most fruitful and constructive and that there was not any negativity, as previously mentioned, in relation to the approach taken by those senators in examining this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, as I stated earlier, deals with counselling and mediation. The stated aims of the amendments are, firstly, to facilitate greater use of mediation, counselling and arbitration in the resolution of family law disputes, both within the court and in approved organisations in the community. The second aim of these amendments is to provide for an approval mechanism for community based counselling and mediation organisations to become approved mediation and/or counselling organisations under the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect is to expand the opportunity for approved organisations to undertake mediation and counselling that arises under the Family Law Act. The fourth intended aim of these amendments is to extend the immunity provisions that presently exist from court based personnel to approved mediators. I add that there is the further intention of extending the secrecy and admission provisions that presently exist from court based personnel to approved community mediators and counsellors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose these amendments as they reflect the trend away from litigation and one which progresses towards resolution through negotiation. I would point to the figures which display this in the Family Court in particular. The Family Court, I would suggest, has been very successful in the area of mediation, with some 96.3 per cent of all disputes being settled prior to trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point to the position in my home state of Western Australia. The Family Court there in the late 1970s and early 1980s made much use of the pre-trial conference, which was an effective tool in settling matters before they went to court. I believe that has caught on throughout Australia. In the civil jurisdiction you see the courts making much use of the pre-trial procedure. I believe that these amendments are an extension of that and are quite useful in sorting out matters and in avoiding matters going to court that otherwise should not go to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also imposes an obligation on the court and legal practitioners to consider whether or not to advise the parties concerned about primary dispute mechanisms. It also accommodates an increase in the demand for counselling services that would arise out of this. The bill sets out a counselling and mediation regime and the organisations that would become involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that were raised during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's hearing was that there was nothing to indicate that there would be any regulation as to minimum standards for qualifications training and ongoing professional development in this regard. Added to this concern was the fact that the immunity currently given to court based personnel would extend to the private mediators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to that the government, I understand, has accepted this recommendation and stated that the development of this would occur through broadly based consultations. I hope that these rules and regulations which deal with the supervision of the qualifications of counsellors and the like are comprehensive. I think this is essential. If you are to have effective mediation counselling, you must provide your counsellors and mediators with sufficient training and qualification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of this bill which is most important deals with children. In relation to this aspect the bill proposes a fundamental change in philosophy. Two reports on these issues have been instrumental in relation to these changes. The first of these was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Patterns of parenting after separation report</EMPHASIS> by the Family Law Council, and there was an evaluation taken out in relation to the United Kingdom Children's Act 1989. There was a report on this in 1994 to the Attorney-General by way of letter of advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In both reports the Family Law Council concluded that cooperative parenting after separation was both beneficial and desirable for the welfare of the child and would be facilitated if the language of family law did not carry overtones of ownership&mdash;and previous speakers have touched on this. The term `custody' implies what one might look upon as an aspect of ownership. One has custody of documents or chattels. I think it is an unfortunate term when looking at children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look back on my involvement with family law as a private practitioner, I certainly did discover that with some of my clients and the people I dealt with there was an aspect of ownership and that the person who got custody won. There was an aspect of there being a winner and a loser. That was an unfortunate aspect of this term. Similarly with the term `access', you have access to land or access to a right of way. Again that has connotations of proprietary aspects. I think the new terms or concepts of parental responsibility and parenting plans are, indeed, a step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of parents obtaining an order for custody or access, they will now obtain residence and contact orders. This is to allow day-to-day care and the long-term care of the child to be made separately and to emphasise the joint responsibilities of parents in relation to the provision of residence and contact. I think it is most important that the message be got across to parents that there is a joint responsibility in the future welfare of the children after a separation has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some concern raised at the public hearings of the legal and constitutional committee regarding this change in terminology. These concerns were based on the lack of definition of the new terms, and the misunderstandings which might follow. For my part, I would agree that any change in terminology goes through a transitional period where people have to adapt to the change, but one thing I find quite agreeable in relation to terms such as `parental responsibility' and `parental plans' is that you are involving plain English. Anyone who came to this new legislation without any prior knowledge would understand what those terms mean. I do not think there will be much problem in relation to those terms. I think the average man and woman in the street would readily understand them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing which did arise was the concern of the Law Council of Australia about the lack of scrutiny in consent orders and parenting plans that would be presented to the Family Court. As such, the committee expressed some concern in relation to this. Certainly in relation to property, there are certain requirements that have to be met&mdash;maintenance and the various agreements that are provided for&mdash;and you find that the court has some aspect of inquiry when one looks at deeds of agreement in relation to property. I would have thought that in relation to children this ability should be available to the court where there is an agreement put to the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could certainly say that the parents know what is best for the children. But after there has been a separation, I think there is some role for the court to play in that regard, because at that stage perhaps the parents are not working in conjunction with each other and may well be agreeing to things for ulterior motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the various orders that can be made, I have touched on residence orders, which deal with where the child will live; contact orders, which deal with contact between the child and another person; but there are also child maintenance orders and special purpose orders which can be made. You could have a variety of aspects being dealt with in these four separate areas. I think that flexibility is quite important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter which did arise during the hearings was that presented by the grandparents action group. In this regard I refer to the grandparents action group of Western Australia, which made detailed representations to me. I thought these representations entailed a good deal of merit. Basically, the gist of what this group stated was that section 69C of the act mentions those people who can initiate orders or apply for orders and that grandparents were left out. Grandparents were really left in that class of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the bill I have before me, I note that grandparents are still not yet included, although I understood the government was minded to accede to this concern and allow provisions specifically for grandparents. From my experience in family law, where you had a break-up between husband and wife, the grandparents played a key role generally in the care of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there would be no harm done in the bill referring specifically to grandparents, so that your primary application would come from the parents of the child and then, if you had to have a pecking order, you would consider the grandparents next and then other people such as relations or perhaps a de facto spouse. But I do think it is important that grandparents be given that recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other matters I will touch on briefly. Firstly, the potential criminal sanction in relation to Family Court registrars mentioned in section 67P. The committee expressed concern about this. I have the gravest of concerns about this provision. Indeed, His Honour Mr Justice Nicholson, who appeared before the committee, stated in relation to this provision, `The penalty is both unnecessary and objectionable. The court objects strongly to it and points out that such a sanction is found nowhere else in the Family Law Act.' I would endorse those comments. I believe it really is an over-reaction to a situation which does not require this sort of action. It really does set a precedent which is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect I would touch on is section 68T(5), which the committee expressed some concern about. The committee stated in recommendation 2 in its report in March this year that the 21 days now provided for in the bill as the period during which a person is prevented from appealing against the decision of a magistrate's court to interfere with a contact order made by the Family Court should be reduced to three days. This was basically saying that, if you appealed a contact order which prohibited you from having access, you could be denied access for up to 21 days because of the waiting period you had to endure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee thought that there should be available to the person concerned a much shorter period under which to file an application or an appeal. I think that is a very important point, and one which could result in furthering animosity between parties where one party was stopped by a contact order from having access and then had to wait 21 days within which the appeal could be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a very important aspect. As I understand it, the government has not taken this on board. I hope I am wrong in that regard. But if I am not, it is regrettable that the government has not taken that aspect on board. I certainly think that a lot of people in Australia with access orders&mdash;as they are currently known&mdash;made in favour of them would be apprehensive about this sort of amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect touched on in the committee's report dealt with the question of domestic violence. The committee in its report looked at the question of domestic violence and it recommended that section 68K be redrafted to express in positive terms that the Family Court when making an order must have regard to safeguards in order to avoid exposure to family violence. This is again another thoroughly worthwhile amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the two reports on these bills of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Whilst I welcome the various provisions that I have touched on in the Family Law Reform Bill, I also express the concerns which have been expressed by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I think this is one of the greatest amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 since the act's inception in that year, and I believe that some review and scrutiny of how these amendments progress is essential. Hopefully, the government will be responsive to any feedback in relation to the operation of these all-encompassing amendments, but that is something that we will have to deal with in the future if and when it arises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with amendments to the Family Law Act through the Family Law Reform Bill and the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill. This act probably affects more Australians than any other act, except the tax act. That is not an original comment of mine, but we need to be reminded, every now and again, that these are bills of such magnitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, 48,256 divorces were granted in Australia. We have been proceeding at about that rate for some considerable time. That gives an indication of the extent to which people are involved in this area. One of the significant differences between this act and the tax act is that the Family Law Act is a far more emotionally charged area of activity, I believe, so we need to look at it from the point of view of all parties involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that these bills in part respond to was tabled in November 1992 and was titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Family Law Act 1975: aspects of its operation and interpretation</EMPHASIS>. The committee report contained 120 recommendations. One of the recommendations was that the committee itself should go ahead and analyse, look at and examine the Child Support Agency because, during the time of the hearing of the first inquiry, the question of the Child Support Agency came up to such an extent that we felt we had to recommend a review of that as well. That review has also been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of great disappointment to me that the government for some reason has shelved dealing with the significant issues under the Child Support Agency act. I believe that the agency itself has taken note of the recommendations that we made with respect to its operations. I believe the agency has made many changes and is working diligently and conscientiously towards making its aspect of it function properly, but the government seems to have washed its hands of dealing with the significant issues relating to the formula which we dealt with. The time for the government to have responded is now long overdue; they have obviously put it off hoping to hide behind it before the next election in that they have said that they will not respond until next year. They cannot be condemned strongly enough, I believe, for ignoring that very significant aspect. It is what is driving so much of the anguish and despair that exists in our community at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act itself that we are reviewing is 20 years old, and it has been referred to quite extensively recently in the media. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 1 October started off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Twenty years after the introduction of the Family Law Act senior court officials have declared its original goal `impossible' to fulfil. Former Attorney-General Lionel Murphy's dream of a `friendly family court' which would end the bitterness of marital breakdowns was beyond any human institution", court officials have said.</PARA>
<PARA>And that of course is the fact. I think this is where people were misled in the first instance, by thinking that one could turn this area of law and this area of human activity into a friendly family court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it might have been better had those who put this act together in 1975 been more realistic about what could have been achieved rather than proceeding with this concept of the friendly Family Court and producing a situation where people expected things to be so much better. They have not been. The reason why they have not been better is that you cannot change human nature. You cannot take out of divorce the human hurt that so often flows from it. You cannot take out the shattered dreams that have resulted from the breakdown of the marriage. You cannot take away the aspirations of a couple in love proceeding to marriage in the first place. I think that point was missed, and it is a great pity that it was missed because it might have been easier otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Law Act, though reprinted, is a pretty formidable document. It could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as a friendly act to deal with. Section 38 has 55 little subsections and bits to it. You need someone who is fairly competent to help you find your way around that. Section 66 starts on page 82 and finishes on page 100 with 31 principal clauses containing up to 11 subclauses. It concludes with 66ZE(1) and (2). I mention that merely to point out that it is not a simple document that anyone can just pick up, thumb through, and find out what will happen to them in the event that their marriage has failed. There are many issues in the act that we could discuss today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the 1975 act was flawed for missing the point of what would happen afterwards. You could take the concept of fault out of the law, certainly, but you could not take it out of the hearts and minds of the people who feel aggrieved by the way they have been treated by someone else in this jurisdiction. This is the second major inquiry by the parliament into the Family Law Act, and there is no doubt that there will be more inquiries in time to come. It is a very emotional area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that we have before us at the present time deal with some of the significant issues contained in the report relating to counselling and mediation. They are most welcome. They are important. They will need to be constantly reviewed, and managed in a way that they can be as meaningful as possible to the people who come before the court and whose marriages have failed. We need to go through the grieving process, in particular, and solve the problems of getting on with life&mdash;especially for the children of the former marriage&mdash;with as few traumas from the breakdown as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things in the act that I particularly welcome, and that I would have liked to have been a recommendation in the original report, relates to the use of the word `custody'. I was not able to persuade the committee at the time that we should recommend getting rid of that word. I suppose you can completely get rid of it. When two people have a child, that child is in the custody of both of them forever and no-one can change that. Until we shift attitudes on the definition of that word we will continue to have problems in this area. It might take a decade for it to work its way out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Custody' is an extremely emotive word. This country was started by many of the first settlers coming here in custody. `Custody' tends to bring up images of being in the hands of the police at a police station. `Custody' in this area tends to mean owning the child: `He won't have custody of my children' or `I won't let her have custody of my children.' The word is spat out with such venom. It means ownership, and ownership is the last thing that any parent actually has of their child. The High Court in Marian's case has been quoted often enough. The principle of law is that parental rights are derived from parental duty and exist only so long as they are needed for the protection of the person and the property of the child. In my view, the word `custody' has to be eliminated&mdash;and probably `guardianship' as well because the misunderstandings as to what it means are fairly great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having given birth to a child, the question of joint custody exists forever and nobody changes it. That is what I would hope. The court, if it is required to make a determination about what happens to the children of the marriage, will make a whole range of orders covering such things as where the children will live and which parent will make decisions about the children's health, welfare and education and all the other things that need to be determined. It may well be that a court will make an order that one parent has no contact with the children. The word `custody' would not be used here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that way, the concept of ownership can be eliminated. Honourable senators might think that is playing with words. However, my experience in this area indicates that it is a lot more than playing with words: it has real significance. Maintenance for the children these days is normally determined under the Child Support Agency. If it is a matter for the court it will be spelt out. I believe that in time we will get rid of the concept of ownership of children. The children may live principally with the mother and visit the father at certain times and live with him. It could spell out addresses and a lot of other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we would then be moving in a direction which would make a difference. In the future, as in the past, most of the orders with respect to children will be consent orders whereby the parents put down the arrangements that they want the court to take into account in determining whether or not proper arrangements have been made for the welfare of the children of the marriage. They could be expansive or less expansive, depending on the circumstances. But if the court itself has to determine what will happen with the children, and there is a contested hearing, the word `custody' should not be used in the orders that are finally presented to the parties. I believe that in time we would be making a difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the governments's attitude to this. The government did what the report suggested: it took further evidence and advice about it. I see it as a big plus. Associated with that are the recommendations in relation to parenting plans. I do not believe that the court should be involved in inspecting every parenting arrangement that comes before it. I think that is far too intrusive.

There is no interview technique, biochemical or psychological test that will accurately predict who will attempt suicide, thus there is little that can be done to identify `at risk' personnel other than general vigilance. Personnel, however, who have attempted suicide, are considered to be potentially `at risk', and there is a Health Policy Directive which requires their comprehensive assessment by a medical officer, assisted as required by others, including a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a chaplain, a social worker, the Commanding Officer, and the next-of-kin. On the basis of this assessment appropriate preventive action is taken as required.</PARA>
