<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night in the adjournment debate Senator Abetz came into the chamber and made some statements with regard to comments that he attributed to me. He implied that I had said the government was deliberately delaying a decision with regard to the AQIS draft risk analysis and decisions that would arise from it with regard to quarantine matters and restrictions relating to the importation of salmon meat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, it is a total untruth on behalf of Senator Abetz to come in here and say that, because I in fact never said that. If he had been listening, he would have understood&mdash;he should not have come in here again&mdash;that I said yesterday that, with regards to the consideration of the draft risk analysis and the submissions that have been received by way of public input to it, the assessment of those submissions would take some time. It could well mean that there is a need to do additional scientific work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Abetz knew anything about the issue, he would also know that that additional scientific work could take a long period of time. In fact, in the view of some AQIS officers it could take up to 10 years. On that basis, I said in a brief to the press that you could not expect that it was likely that there would be a decision with regard to the AQIS draft risk analysis and recommendations arising from it before the federal election. That is the factual position. </PARA>

<PARA>This report, which deals with the assets tests that apply to social security payments, is the second and final report on this reference. I should note that this is a majority report and that Senator John Woodley, while agreeing with most of the committee's findings, has exercised his right to attach a dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity of the rules and regulations which govern access to social security payments rival those associated with the taxation system. This inquiry has been one of the most technically difficult I have been associated with, as it was essential that members of the committee came to terms with how these rules are applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a common misconception amongst some people that the social security system is designed to provide a minimum income for all Australians. However, the social security system is no longer a minimum income support system. The system is based on the philosophy that those who can look after themselves should do so. However, those in genuine hardship should be given help, and there are hardship provisions which should assist people in these circumstances. It is important also to note that the system is made up of a number of separate programs, each with its own tightly defined objectives, target groups and rules of access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three major programs examined by the committee were jobsearch and newstart allowances, family payments and the age pension. Most submissions and evidence concentrated on these programs. The committee investigated farming families' access to these payments and the impact of the assets test. In relation to jobsearch, the committee found that few farmers access the jobsearch allowance&mdash;and this is not surprising, because they have an ongoing commitment to the farm and therefore cannot satisfy the activity test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that the jobsearch allowance hardship provisions, designed to assist farmers who were ineligible for basic JSA because of assets, misses the mark and needs to be changed. In particular, the committee recommends that the requirement to offer the property for sale should be dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to family payments, the committee received evidence from the National Farmers Federation suggesting that farmers are disadvantaged and in fact only 45 per cent have access, whereas 90 per cent of families receive payment. The committee found that this evidence was based on incomplete information. The likely situation is that farmers have about the same access to these payments as other sections of the community. I say `likely' because the DSS does not collate these statistics. We have recommended that it do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was astounded that the department was unable to supply the committee with such basic information. I appreciate the Department of Social Security's main role is to ensure that payments are made to those people entitled to them. However, I fail to understand how policy makers can be expected to assess how well programs are reaching their targets unless accurate data is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the family payments program, again the committee was not impressed with the hardship provisions and has recommended changes to make access for farming families more equitable. In relation to pensions, the committee found that the assets test does have a significant impact on farming families access to social security. There is however a more fundamental issue that I believe will become increasingly more important in rural Australia&mdash;the need for orderly intergenerational transfer of the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that this issue needs more attention and that there needs to be a better integration of government policies&mdash;including pensions in relation to retirement, managerial succession and assets transfer on farms. Specifically, the committee expressed concern about the deemed income and gifting provisions for pensions and recommended that they need to be changed if farming families are being disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter the committee looked at was whether the assets test should be scrapped altogether. Given the changes the committee recommended to each program to make them more equitable for farming families, existing concessions that recognise the special circumstances of farmers and the need to maintain incentive for people to self-support, the committee did not consider it could support such a proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's views on whether the assets test should be retained or scrapped were not determined by the likely cost. However, the committee did on a number of occasions seek information about how much exempting the farm assets from the assets test would cost. DSS advised that it had done some `very rough figuring' and estimated that the cost could be in the region of $1 billion. However, the department was either unwilling or unable to supply any more accurate information than this, and I personally consider that the accuracy of their estimate is highly questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also recommended several administrative reforms&mdash;for example, specific information and better dissemination of farming families entitlements to social security and the upgrading of training for DSS regional staff to ensure they understand the special circumstances of farm families. The committee considers that these reforms are necessary because many farmers are unaware of their entitlements and do not apply. For example, the committee received a number of first-hand accounts of aged farmers being unaware that hardship provisions even existed. I believe that the Department of Social Security should do everything possible to ensure people receive the assistance to which they are entitled. This is particularly important in the case of aged farmers, who are often isolated and unfamiliar with how the social security system works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I wish to emphasise that there is an urgent need to review the application of the hardship provisions associated with each of the social security programs examined by the committee. In times past when the rural sector was prosperous, access of farmers to social security payments was not an issue. Farms could generally produce enough income to support farmers and their families as well. However, this is no longer always the case. There are a number of well understood reasons for this. One of the most significant has been the exceptionally severe drought which deprived many otherwise highly efficient and viable farmers of their livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, there is a real hardship in the bush. I believe that there is evidence that the hardship provisions have failed to alleviate the very difficult circumstance faced by many farming families who are left to depend on charity in some cases. I consider this is intolerable, and I reiterate that it is most important that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) have another look at the hardship provisions for all programs. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

Following the restructuring of the committee system, the reference was subsequently taken up by the Senate Economics References Committee, which my colleague Senator Ferguson chairs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of the referral to a Senate committee, therefore, allowed industry bodies to put their concerns and recommendations directly to the committee and, through the committee, to the government.

Given the issues involved and the fact that there is no indemnity right across all sectors which are affected by this issue, I think time is essential.

<PARA>The committee's 58th general report covers the period January to December 1994. As in previous years, 1994 was extremely busy. The committee tabled 13 reports regarding projects which cost more than $320 million. This outcome followed the committee meeting on 77 occasions during the year. Nineteen public hearings and 29 inspections were held in centres as far afield as Port Wakefield, South Australia, and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> on Garden Island, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projects examined were equally diverse, ranging from the upgrading of a transonic wind tunnel for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation to overseas works in Hanoi and Port Moresby, to a new housing development for defence personnel and their families in Sydney. I might add we do not travel to Port Moresby and Hanoi, as much as we would like to. Most of those overseas projects are considered by video. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations made in the reports, similarly, are wide-ranging and the vast majority of them were accepted by the government and will be implemented. A number of common themes are canvassed in many reports. These include the need for project designers and constructors to provide: measures designed to conserve energy and water; measures designed to facilitate ease of access to people with disabilities; measures to protect the environment and heritage; fire safety measures; the involvement of local construction industry in projects, especially outside major capital cities; and the need for more rigorous analysis of sites selected for construction projects to ensure that they are not contaminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the year, the committee was briefed by officials from a variety of departments and agencies. The briefings covered such matters as: private funding of a proposed car park at Melbourne Airport; the future of the army's base at Puckapunyal and RAAF base Williams; the Christmas Island rebuilding program; concurrent documentation; value management; new directions for Australian Estate Management, which is responsible for managing the Commonwealth estate, estimated to be worth $2.5 billion; and the activities of the Construction Industry Development Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also spent time inspecting projects previously examined during their construction or upon completion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the committee's work for the year concluded and as the year of commemorations of the end of the Second World War was about to begin, it was coincidental that the last report tabled involved the redevelopment of a defence establishment, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS>, an establishment of exceptional historical significance in the defence of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that was at issue was whether the amendment covered new large exempt companies coming onto the pile or only those existing ones. For the benefit of the minister&mdash;and he may already be familiar with this&mdash;the point we got to yesterday, just before the standing orders prevented us completing this bill, was that we had made this case out as being ours. Yes, we agree with moving to a small/large distinction; yes, we agree with lessening the burden on small companies. And we, nonetheless, believe that it is not appropriate to put an additional burden onto large exempt proprietary companies, under the guise of simplification, and that they should be able to continue with their existing reporting requirements; that is, they should be able to choose whether to have an auditor or to file key financial statements.</PARA>

We do not see the appropriateness of that distinction that the government seeks to maintain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be pointed out that, whilst the simplification task force recommended this small/large test, none of its approaches in corporate law simplification related to the matter of accountability or disclosure. That is not their brief and that is not their aim. Their aim is to simplify corporate law. So this new argument that the small/large test is going to bring about greater accountability or disclosure is not correct. It never was the brief of the simplification task force. It is a new argument they have latched onto to justify the small/large test. The task force suggested the small/large test originally simply because they thought it was simpler. They have erred in that thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can just as properly be debated that the existing system is simpler or, for that matter, more accountable and with equal disclosure. Really, the simplification task force was not at all concerned about disclosure or accountability. It was not even in its particular brief. This is just a new argument brought in to defend to the death this small/large test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force erred in that it is attempting to treat private companies in the same way as they treat public companies. They are getting their brief mixed. They are not understanding that there is a difference in the corporate world between private and public. You cannot place the same onerous responsibilities on the private company as you do on the public company, for good reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public companies have a greater responsibility for disclosure, and so they should. They go out into the marketplace where they trade their shares, where they raise equity, and it is right and fitting that greater responsibility for accountability and disclosure be required of public companies. But you cannot fit that same requirement to the private companies. That is where the task force has erred. It is trying to treat small private companies in the same way as it treats public companies, as you would on the stock exchange. Therein lies the new extra layers of cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very costly. Every piece of disclosure you place on a company is going to be an extra cost. Transferring private companies into the public arena and giving them similar responsibilities of course is going to mean new and burdensome costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In corporate law we are forever trying to find that magic formula between accountability and disclosure, and overregulating and bringing the wheels of business to a grinding halt. We are forever balancing those two, which is not dissimilar to the tax arena&mdash;with fringe benefits tax, for example. In your pursuit to collect greater revenue, you can get yourself very tangled up in extra regulations and burdens upon business in reporting their tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that since the 1980s we have stepped up our requirement for disclosure and accountability, and rightly so. Obviously in the 1980s there was too little, but we have stepped it up. The Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities, of which I am a member, has had much to do with stepping up the responsibilities of directors. We are looking at the moment at the area of derivatives, following the Barings Bank collapse. We do not want something like that in this country. That requires new regulation&mdash;a new look at the regulations so that we do not get troubles in our futures markets or, as we did in the 1980s, directors totally devoid of responsibility. They have a new set of responsibilities. In fact, as you would expect, they are complaining about overregulating the area of directors, that we may have gone too far. But that is part of the balance we are trying to get, and this is not dissimilar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we rely too heavily on regulation, we are going to be bringing business to a grinding halt, so we rely on a great deal in the corporate area on self-regulation. The Australian Stock Exchange corporate governance guidelines are a self-regulatory process. It is a first step. If those guidelines do not work, if they are seen to have failed, then we may have to regulate, but self-regulation is always the first step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Stock Exchange corporate governance guidelines, I think, are standing up quite well, as can be seen in the Coles Myer case. In the name of corporate governance, the institutions seem to be taking a great interest in that particular case. There, corporate governance guidelines are on the line, they are to be tested; the self-regulation process is now being tested in the Coles Myer case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot lay everything at the door of the Australian Securities Commission either. It simply does not have the time or the resources as it stands now. Of course, if the government wished to double the ASC's resources, then it could do double the work. But, as always with these matters, that would be an extra public cost: the more you regulate, the greater the public cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at present the Australian Securities Commission is under great criticism for its inability to check the prospectus process. That is a far more important issue than the one we are dealing with. One of the great faults of the 1980s in the public arena was shoddy prospectuses. The Australian Securities Commission has the very important responsibility of getting the checking of the prospectus process under control. That is a problem the ASC is greatly burdened with at the moment. If you listen to its critics, it simply does not have it under control&mdash;and that should be one of its primary sources. The ASC needs more resources for that problem than for the suggestion we are making here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it stands today, you cannot rely on the Australian Securities Commission to be the monitor of who should and who should not be in the small large arena. I really do wonder how the ASC will cope with this extra burden. Anyone who saw the ASC's representatives before the committee will know that they are a bit googly-eyed when it was suggested that the ASC take up the new responsibility of declaring who should and who should not have exemptions. In fact, the chairman asked us to set down the criteria. We had not done it, he does not know what it is and, as yet, we have not seen it. So we are to pass the principle of the legislation here without any of the regulation or criteria to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Dee Margetts would well know that that is a very doubtful process when legislating. Too often we see the legislation go through and then we await the legislation&mdash;if, indeed, we are to regulate. It may just be a set of guidelines for the Australian Securities Commission, and it will not even come through this parliament. So there is the black hole in the argument for the small/large test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this background, it is worthwhile to compare the two competing processes: the small/large test, and the existing system. Our particular amendment goes a long way to returning us to the best of the existing system and it certainly would abolish the worst of the proposed system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing system has this going for it: no-one has ever complained about it. There has been no ground swell for its change at all. This is a classic case of a task force and a parliament tinkering for no reason at all. The present system does force accountability in two particular ways. One of your choices is to audit your books and then not disclose your accounts. That secures the integrity of the books and the business&mdash;and, of course, that is assuming auditors do secure the integrity of the books and the business, although to what degree they do is another argument for another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other choice is to submit your accounts to the Australian Securities Commission. If you do not want to go through the very expensive process of auditing&mdash;and expense would be the only reason you would not want to because auditing can be greatly beneficial&mdash;be it that you are a very small business, then you are required to submit minimal accounts to the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is as simple as that. There is no extra cost; no discrimination, such as the discrimination that the grandfather clause will set up. There is no objection to it. We are upholding the concept of private companies, their privacy. And of course this is supported by the accounting bodies: the Australian Society of Accountants&mdash;of which, I should add, I am a member&mdash;and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the existing system has had a check and balance element since about 1990; it is found in the corporations law and in the accounting standards. Basically that is, as has been reported in our committee report, in a nutshell&mdash;and this is a complicated area&mdash;if there is a public interest to declare your reports, if it is reasonable to expect the existence of users dependent on general purpose financial accounts, then you should publicly disclose; or if a certain number of shareholders require auditing and disclosure. That is a fair check and balance on the existing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In comparison the small/large test is unpopular and not supported by the accountants, be it that they will benefit the most from all this. I appeal to Senator Margetts that, ironically, it is less accountable, or it can be argued to be less accountable. That is how arbitrary this whole debate is. Many of the small companies that will fall into the small category will not be disclosing; but who is to say they should not? In many of those small companies there is a public interest for them to disclose. They will indeed escape any form of disclosure&mdash;not just auditing, but even the most minimal accounts that the existing system requires. There could be, for example, a public interest in a director disclosing his interest or his accounts of his own private company against his directorship in a major company. That is just one example of a public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even political parties may have company offshoots. They will fall into the small area and they will not disclose. So you are totally abolishing the public interest factor in the need for some companies to disclose, no matter how small they are. If the grandfather clause does not divide and rule, I do not know what does in the corporate world. We have already been informed that those companies advantaged by the grandfathering will not have to change their existing system. There will be enormous trade in those companies. They are going to become very valuable. That places those companies which will have to adhere to the small large test at great commercial disadvantage. Those companies that fall into the grandfather section will have a commercial advantage. It seems incredibly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and talk about the absolute ability to rort this system. I think the Senate has heard about the ability to rort the asset valuations. This small/large test has been approached from the wrong angle. It was meant to simplify the corporate law, not to be a matter of disclosure&mdash;which is just a new argument the task force has latched on to. If it is not broken, we should not fix it. We should support the coalition's amendment, which really does return us to some equity in the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a fine balancing act for us. I can see the merits of the arguments on both sides. The good intentions of various parties might not become apparent, if they are good intentions, until after they are put into practice. On the balance, we do not believe any problems that exist will necessarily be solved by the opposition's amendments. However, I am not yet convinced that there are clear enough guidelines on the discretionary principle. I am pleased to see there is an amendment which the government is proposing which generally deals with this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government should feel an obligation to clearly provide some explanation behind those guidelines, make them available to companies and, at the same time, provide clear advice in advance about how you can keep accounts in such a way as to minimise the cost of compliance in audits. That is the thing I am asking: that the government sees an obligation to produce clear information to the companies involved to make sure that they know exactly how they can minimise their compliance costs by the way they present their books, to make it as cost effective and as easy as possible for those audits to take place and to make as clear as possible the guidelines about how this cost and benefit judgment takes place regarding the government's discretionary powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that this kind of debate has not taken place more in respect of competition policy and even the Uruguay Round of GATT.

It is not that this is not important, but we really ought to be talking about these kinds of issues when major policy decisions are taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses often lose out as unsecured creditors. That is why on the balance we are prepared to support the implementation at this stage. But, at the same time, I am flagging that Senator Baume's amendment at the third reading stage has a level of appeal. I would flag that on the balance it is not possible for to us support the opposition's amendment. On the balance, in this instance, we are going with the government's proposal. It has not been an easy decision, but I am flagging that there is a certain attraction to supporting an amendment which means that we will have a chance to look at how the system is working. I will expect the government to voluntarily provide clear guidelines&mdash;not just wait until somebody is in trouble and has a huge bill&mdash;about discretionary provisions and about ways to minimise the audit costs to those businesses which may be subject to these audits. </PARA>

<PARA>I will place on the record a number of items which have arisen during discussions. People anticipate that these sorts of statements will be made to clarify aspects of the amendments. The first amendment omits clause 7 from the bill. Clause 7 would have amended the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994 to alter the commencement of schedule 6 to that act, which deals with the use of penalty units in the Corporations Law. The provision was inserted in anticipation of the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1995 being enacted and commencing earlier this year. At that stage we were waiting for all the states and the Northern Territory to enact legislation which would have enabled the penalty unit provisions to commence. However, due to the unexpected delays in the passage of the bill, schedule 6 will now be commenced by way of a separate proclamation in accordance with the existing provisions of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment will remove from the small business guide a paragraph indicating that large proprietary companies must have their accounts audited. This change is consequential upon the fourth amendment which I will mention in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment inserts proposed new subsections 313(11A) and (11B). These proposed new subsections relate to the exercise by the ASC of its discretion under section 313 of the Corporations Law to relieve a large proprietary company of its obligations to comply with the law's audit requirements on the basis that those requirements would impose unreasonable burdens on the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that in exercising this discretion the ASC should be required to take into account the matters referred to by the committee in its reports. The ASC presently engages in public consultations in drawing up class orders. The Chairman of the ASC has indicated to the Attorney-General that the ASC would be happy to continue its existing policy of consultation in preparing class orders to give relief from the new audit obligations. This is entirely consistent with the current policy of the ASC in carrying out its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment inserts proposed new sections 1409 and 1410 into the Corporations Law. Proposed section 1409 relates to the timing of the application of these new audit requirements for large proprietary companies. It is designed to avoid difficulties that could arise if the audit requirements were to commence some time after the start of a company's financial year. The amendment provides that the first financial year for which large proprietary companies must have their accounts audited under section 296 of the law is the first financial year that starts after the commencement of proposed section 1409. Proposed section 1410 ensures that proprietary companies will be required to provide an annual return for the calendar year in which the bill commences and the year in which the proprietary company is registered. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"and the Senate resolves that not later than two years and six months after the commencement of the amendments set out in items 1 to 6 of Schedule 4 of the bill, the Australian Securities Commission is to cause to be laid on the table a review of the first two years of the operation of those amendments".</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment calls for a review after two years. I thank the Senate for its indication of support. Because the opposition amendment was defeated, there is certainly now a much greater need for this amendment than would have existed had the opposition amendment been carried. That was an amendment which would have made equally fair the obligations of all large proprietary companies to report. The situation now, in this bill, is that some will be given a special privilege, for no good reason; others will not have that privilege, for no good reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My only regret is that this review is to take place not later than two years. I would hope that, in the event of a change of government, the review will take place a lot sooner than that because I believe there will be a need to restore fairness in terms of obligation to report. At present that is being destroyed by this bill. It sets up a special category of companies which, because of either historical accident or choice, or whatever reason may have existed, may have chosen to tick the box saying their accounts are audited and therefore do not have to reveal financial statistics publicly. They will continue to do so while companies that are newcomers, coming into the area, building themselves up from small companies, will have to face an additional unfair discriminatory burden that does not exist for existing companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will be obliged not only to go to the expense of being audited, but also of revealing their full financial details to the public and to competitors who do not have to reveal anything. They will have to reveal these figures to competitors who, under this legislation, will reveal absolutely nothing. That is the unfair and discriminatory consequence of the defeat of the opposition's amendment and the passing of the government's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Margetts properly pointed out, it does, however, allow a discretion to the Securities Commission to permit some not to reveal their information. But it is only a few. In other words, there is an added discrimination. There are those who, by historical accident, will reveal nothing. There are some who, as a result of the decisions of the ASC using its capacity to single out a few for this kind of special treatment, will get special treatment, and then there are the rest who have to reveal all and will face an unfair and discriminatory burden that is not faced by their competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That underlines the need for this review. I must say that, while I am glad that this is here as a sort of failsafe in the sense that this discrimination hopefully will only continue for a little while, I do regret that it is going to exist at all. I think this legislation will bring mixed blessings. It will bring blessings to the small end of the small business sector, the small proprietary companies, because they will have their reporting burden significantly alleviated. I am very grateful for that, on behalf of all the people in small business I have talked to about this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the good news. The bad news for those small businesses that succeed, that have worked hard and built themselves up to having more than 50 employees or having assets of more than $5 million or a turnover of more than $10 million, is that they are the ones who are going to be discriminated against unfairly. That is one of the reasons I would hope that in this review it will be recognised that, firstly, the high jump level anyway is an unreasonable one&mdash;because two out of those three criteria mean that you would qualify as a large business&mdash;but, secondly, I would hope that the unfair discrimination against a section of these people will be seen after two years of operation to be unfair. Of course, by then we will have a government in place which will be concerned with fairness, equity and decency in this area. I have every confidence that the government which will be in place in two years time will correct this anomalous and discriminatory situation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look forward to hearing from you in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Joan Neowhouse</PARA>
<PARA>That illustrates the whole problem in the debate which we are about to enjoin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, let me put the coalition's position on double dipping on the record. Double dipping in the context of this legislation is the receipt of Medicare and/or nursing home benefits in respect of what the legislation prosaically calls compensable conditions, usually injuries or diseases which arise from an episode of personal injury and for which the injured person seeks compensation through common law remedies, workers compensation, or third party or general insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it perfectly clear the coalition has absolutely no difficulty with this principle. If a person receives Medicare or nursing home benefits in respect of a compensable condition and then receives a compensation award covering the cost of treatment, then it is only right that the Commonwealth be repaid the taxpayer funded benefits already paid out. What the coalition and, to their credit, the Australian Democrats have argued ever since this legislation was foreshadowed is that the mechanisms it proposes for recovering these double dipped benefits are cumbersome and costly, and spread the burden unfairly on compensation payers as well as the claimant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because it is at the centre of our concerns, I will pay particular attention to the administration fee proposed in this package and its inequities. The coalition has stated its opposition to this legislation on the fundamental point that the cure for the double dipping problem first proposed by the government is in fact worse than the disease, and that the $40 million or so per year that the government estimates will be saved for the taxpayer will actually be almost totally swallowed up by the cost of the administrative machinery operated by the Health Insurance Commission, insurance companies and other compensation payers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about the evolution of these bills. As we know, these bills emerged from the findings of a review of the relationship between compensation and health and community services programs. This, in turn, was part of the major review of professional indemnity arrangements for health care professionals, conducted for the government by Fiona Tito of the Department of Human Services and Health, which is yet to be released. The report of the compensation review, however, was released as long ago as mid-1993, not very long after the last federal election. Yet here we are just before the next election discussing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time there were informal consultations with interested parties about the finding of the review, particularly with insurers, work cover and third party authorities, medical defence organisations and the legal profession. Yet when this legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives in December last year all these parties were taken by surprise and some of them were only notified of the legislation after it had actually been introduced into the parliament. That hardly seems to be the mark of a conscientious, consulting government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the same problem, you will recall, with the recent health legislation, which was a classic example of government being in power too long. There was no consultation and in fact the so-called contracts that were supposed to have been developed for introduction on 1 October in a few days time have not been signed by any of the providers, although some have been signed between the insurers and the hospitals. That is another classic example of government being in power too long&mdash;it believes it knows everything and does not need to consult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills passed through the House pretty quickly on the government's numbers but on reaching this place they were able to be scrutinised by the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. This occurred in March. After public hearings, the committee found in its report to the Senate, first, that there had been a serious lack of consultation between interested parties and the government in the development of the bills. Secondly, it noted the concerns of the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills about the main bill's potential to erode the doctrines of legal professional privilege and self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the committee found there was evidence that the legislation may have involved breaches of privacy in respect of traditional doctor-patient relationships. Fourthly, it found that there were widespread concerns about the administrative costs of this legislation, particularly the proposed administration fee, and particularly noted the Insurance Council of Australia's concern that this fee would effectively be a `new tax' imposed on insurers and their policyholders. Finally, it raised the question of whether better mechanisms could be found to deal with the double dipping problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation committee and its recommendation basically told the government to go away and start again, not least by consultation with the interested parties. It did not want to see a dog's breakfast of the legislation package debated in this place at that time. Consultation did take place, if you can call a series of meetings in March consultations, and more than two months later a raft of over 40 amendments to the bills emerged full grown from the department. They were not circulated as drafts for comment to interested parties either in this place or in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments, which we will discuss if these bills go to the consideration in detail stage, addressed the criticisms about legal professional privilege and offered a bulk payment arrangement for double dipped benefits to compensation payers but, if anything, made the overall package more rather than less cumbersome and more rather than less costly to administer. They certainly did not dispense with the administration fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dying days of the autumn session, the coalition and the Democrats arrived separately at the same conclusion&mdash;if the legislation were debated, we would have no hesitation in voting it down. Yet, in announcing our position, the coalition made it clear that we were not opposed to the principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for health, Dr Wooldridge, wrote to the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, indicating this and suggesting that, should the government adopt either of two simpler models proposed by the Insurance Council and the Law Council of Australia, we would not hesitate to support the legislation. You would have thought that would have had a considered response, but Dr Lawrence's response was to play politics and misrepresent the coalition's position in a way that has become a hallmark of her political style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing happened until late August when discussions were held between the government and the Insurance Council on further modifications to these bills. Then, just a week ago, the government showed its complete contempt for consultation, bypassing further amendments through caucus so that the first the Insurance Council heard of them was when the shadow minister advised it of that fact. Such passes for consultation under the government. It is a combination of arrogance and fear&mdash;arrogance, in that the government always presumes to know what is best for all concerned and then proceeds to impose its views on them; and yet fear that, in the final analysis, it will be rolled by those it perceives to be its opponents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we come to today. I want to say that while the government may believe that it insisted on resolving this legislation, it only got to the floor of this place because it had to be dragged kicking and screaming by the coalition and the Australian Democrats to a position where the contents of the bill had at least kernels of workability which can be refined in debate, yet where the major concerns of compensation payers are not fully resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If any legislation emerges at the end of this debate it will be because the most unfair aspect of it&mdash;the so-called administration fee&mdash;will have been removed from this package by the Senate, and because other outstanding points of disagreement will be left unresolved and tolerated with the greatest of reluctance, by insurers in particular, with a spirit of compromise rather than acceptance as positive innovations in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn now to the most contentious feature of this package, the administration fee imposed on compensation payers to make these mechanisms, in the quaint phrase of the government, `self-funding'. Let us call this charge what it is, no less than an industry specific tax to impose a particular government policy agenda on compensation payers. The coalition believes that the tax is grossly unfair to insurers, be they general, third party, work cover or workers' compensation. It is shifting to these insurers the cost of what is effectively a function of government&mdash;collecting the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says to us, `Well, it's fair. The insurers have the benefit of their clients having access to the Medicare system and up-front benefits while their compensation claims are pending. Why shouldn't they kick in to support a system that relates to their commercial activities for the private benefit enjoyed by their clients at public expense through Medicare and nursing home benefits? Why should the taxpayer pick up the tab for recovering what is rightly the taxpayer's?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not make sense. Can't the government see that what we have here is a community benefit. Ultimately, it is not big, bad business that pays but Mr and Mrs Average Australian who want to be insured against personal injury or who have to contribute to compulsory third party insurance. Can't the government see that it will be the employer who pays through the worker's compensation system because, if these costs are passed on to insurers, they will be passed on to the consumers of insurance through higher premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales just now major battles are going on for the future direction of compulsory third party insurance in that state. There have been three rises in compulsory third party premiums in New South Wales already this year, and recently there were reports of a fourth rise on the way. The tax proposed under this legislation will be yet another cost burden which will find its way to the ordinary members of our community in the form of higher premiums, including for third party. The coalition finds this unacceptable and specious to argue, as the government does, that insurers can afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also oppose the administration tax on another principle: non-government bodies should pay for what is effectively the implementation of a given government policy. In the health portfolio, this is the second example this year of this cavalier approach to other people's money. Senators will recall the protracted consideration of Labor's health insurance reform package with its health insurance complaints mechanism funded by a levy on health insurers. This levy is to be calculated when it comes into operation by a membership-based formula. In other words, each health fund member pays some of his or her premium to support the government imposed complaints mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the present legislation, policy holders of injury related insurers will have to dig into their pockets to support the, I understand, nearly 100 public servants&mdash;although there is a debate about how many&mdash;and support infrastructure that the Health Insurance Commission wants to put in place. This is just unfair, and it is not just user pays like the government no doubt contends. User pays relates to the making of a financial contribution to the government revenue in return for the enjoyment of a given benefit such as a service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is unfettered bureaucracy. This precedent removes the responsibility from government to contain its own costs, as it will always be possible to identify some user-pays target which could be asked to pay for the extra bureaucracy. This is an important issue for taxpaying consumers, as the government is transferring the responsibility from the public sector to the private sector. This means the cost of the extra bureaucracy, anything between 100 and 160 public servants, is transferred from the transparent area of tax revenue, subject to scrutiny, and hidden by government as a private sector cost. Government is therefore not held accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current message from the federal government is that government spending will be restrained. This legislation indicates the opposite. In this case, the insurers are the ones providing the services, by doing the lion's share of the work of government and identifying what benefits have been double dipped and then, in accordance with the legislation, taking most of the steps to recover from the claimant. If anything, the government should be paying them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a third line of criticism of the government's proposed tax; that is, that the costs it covers should be seen as offset against revenue gains from the recovered benefits which would otherwise be lost to the Commonwealth. We believe that the cost of the tax to insurers will be higher than the just under $10 million estimated in the legislation documentation, but let's assume that the government's cost and revenue estimates are reliable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the government's own estimation, the benefits to be recovered will be around $40 million in a year&mdash;that is $40 million otherwise lost to the Treasury. The estimated cost of directly recovering these benefits is, as I have said, around $10 million. In other words, for every dollar spent in recovering the double-dipped benefits, the Commonwealth actually gains three. If the process were as simple as other interested parties have suggested, the proportion of dollars spent to dollars saved could be even greater. Surely this is not a bad profit margin which can be absorbed as an administrative cost of revenue raising, just as the operation of the Australian Taxation Office is seen as a justifiable cost in raising consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, this administration fee, this tax, is unfair. It targets compensation payers, who would, in fact, be providing a significant service to the Commonwealth at no cost to it and who, I should add, have to absorb their own costs pending the determination of liability in compensation claims to which they are enjoined by way of their contracts of insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot, and we will not, support this tax for the reasons I have outlined. We will vote, therefore, against giving the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Administration Fee Bill a second reading, and I hope that the Democrats, Greens and Independents will join us in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, these are not the only concerns held by insurers, lawyers and other interested parties about these bills. The two other major outstanding points are, in the coalition's view, the obligation imposed on compensation payers to be responsible for repaying double-dipped benefits to the Health Insurance Commission rather than the claimant who in point of fact incurs the debt; and the failure of the legislation to give relief in the form of adjusted debts to the Commonwealth where the claim is compromised because of risks in litigation, as opposed to contributory negligence where responsibility for the injury is apportioned by the settlement or by the court. In those circumstances, the coalition believes that the amount repayable to the Commonwealth should be reduced by the same percentage that the claim was reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the latter point, the coalition believes that this legislation can be made more palatable to those who have to implement it by making amendments to the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill to recognise risk of compromise settlements where the parties have agreed to a reduced settlement without apportionment of blame. Should this bill reach the consideration in detail stage, I will so move such amendments for the consideration of the Senate, but I stress that we will go no further unless the administration charge disappears from the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that this legislation has progressed very considerably from where it was in March this year, but not because of the government's good sense or willingness to compromise. We also believe that it still falls considerably short of an ideal solution to the problem of double dipping of benefits and compensation matters&mdash;a problem that not one party in this process disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has undertaken to review the operation of this legislation after a period. Should something emerge from the Senate today, on behalf of the coalition I undertake that we, if in government after the very imminent election, will review this legislation in 12 months time and look carefully at its operation. In so doing, we reserve the right to amend it in whatever way we have to to make it as workable or as fair as we possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, I say to the minister opposite that, if the administration fee bill and consequent provisions are deleted, the government will still get their double dip benefits and the coalition will consider the remainder of the package on its overall merits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of health bills is yet another example of this government's failure to do its homework before presenting us with legislation in this place. It is another example of the government's failure to carry out proper and adequate consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills came before the House of Representatives in December of last year. Following their introduction, the Australian Democrats were contacted by a number of organisations most concerned about the impact of the changes in this legislation. These organisations, which included the Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Council of Australia, also complained that they had not been consulted or involved in any way in the drawing up of this legislation. They informed me that, while they had been part of the discussions with government about the particular problem that this legislation is trying to address&mdash;and that is double dipping under Medicare&mdash;they had never been involved in the drawing up of the legislation and in the deciding of what the solutions were going to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a pattern which we see time and again. I have to say that the Department of Human Services and Health certainly seems to be at the forefront of many of these problems. They do not seem to understand the basic principles of consultation and they do not understand that one of the benefits of consultation is that we do not end up with a piece of legislation that is fundamentally flawed, which nobody wants and which people will then fight tooth and nail to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultation does not mean, on the other hand, that the government then has to do what everybody else wants it to do. It does not mean at the end of the day that the government cannot proceed with its own agenda. All it means is that government should spell out its intentions to those people and organisations with a direct interest and involvement in the proposed changes, seek their opinions and at the very least try to establish whether or not what they are saying is workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to these bills, the government could have saved itself a lot of trouble&mdash;it has been close to a year now&mdash;by simply talking through the detail of the legislation with insurers and with lawyers prior to introducing it. Instead, the government has been forced time and again by the Senate back to the negotiating table, and now we are going to see something like 37 amendments to this legislation. Yes, this legislation certainly is now vastly improved but, as has already been said by Senator Herron, the government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming all the way. It certainly was not a smooth process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the bills were introduced into the Senate in February 1995, they were referred, at the instigation of the Democrats, to the Senate community affairs committee. That committee was unanimous in its view that the bills should proceed to the second reading stage only after the department had formally consulted with the relevant interest groups and taken what they were saying seriously. These consultations did take place, but the results were very disappointing. There was virtually no movement whatsoever from the government and a number of outstanding concerns remain unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, when the government attempted to bring the bills back on for debate in June, the Democrats and the coalition indicated they would not be supporting them. At the time, I advised the government that I was entirely sympathetic to what they were trying to do, and we remain so&mdash;we have been since it was first mooted back in 1993&mdash;but that I felt they still needed to do a lot more work to get the legislation to a stage where we could support it, where it would not disadvantage the very people whom we are trying to advantage, and that is those people who need to have support from Medicare until such time as they have a compensation claim decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now finally got to the stage where at least this legislation is workable. It is certainly not without continuing concerns and hassles. I believe we need&mdash;during the committee stage I will seek assurance from the government on this&mdash;a review in 18 months time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recess, the department sat down again with the relevant key organisations, and I think we at last saw a serious willingness to consult and listen to what these organisations were saying. I believe that once the data is in, there is likely to be a more simple way to solve the problems we have had before us. With the 37 amendments, the scheme is now at the point where I believe it is workable and acceptable, even though it is still a long way from being perfect. We have not accepted the government's arguments in support of imposing an administrative fee upon insurers. We will be opposing the introduction of that fee. I will discuss that in greater detail later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the actual scheme itself, the Democrats believe it is entirely appropriate for the Commonwealth to seek to recover Medicare and nursing home benefits when the person who has received the benefits is also entitled to compensation. This integration of compensation schemes with health and community services has long been a vexed issue in Australia. I think it is an issue which could be greatly simplified by moving to some sort of national, no-fault compensation system, but that is unlikely to occur in the near future and it is not something we have before us now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do accept that the Commonwealth has to look for some means by which it can recover its costs. The Commonwealth has opted for this scheme to recover the costs from the compensation payers and insurers. The scheme essentially revolves around insurers notifying the Health Insurance Commission of a claim, the commission then working out how much it is owed and, after settlement takes place, the insurer paying to the Commonwealth the amount owed before paying the remainder of the settlement to the claimant. This is a very simplified version of what is in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 10 months there have been many concerns expressed about the process. Concerns have been expressed about legal confidentiality, privacy, the complexity of arrangements and so on. I am not going to go through these concerns in great detail, other than to say that virtually all of them have now been resolved. There is now provision in the legislation for insurers to make bulk payments after 18 months, there have been limits placed on the abrogation of privilege and changes have been made which avoid potential problems of delay in settlement. Overall, some 37 amendments deliver a much improved scheme and one that I think has demonstrated again the value of this Senate and its role in scrutinising and reviewing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to turn in a little more detail to the question of the administrative fee. We will not support this fee because we believe it is inappropriate and unfair. It is basically a fee which seeks to have the industry bear the government's share of the costs of running the scheme. As the Insurance Council of Australia has pointed out, the insurance industry will already bear its own additional costs in complying with this scheme. That is appropriate, but we do not really see why the industry should also have to pay for the government's side of the process. I also accept the Insurance Council's argument that the scheme is only needed because the Commonwealth has made a policy decision&mdash;a correct decision in our view, as I have said&mdash;to pay all Medicare recipients up-front and then recover its costs once the state based compensation and legal system, et cetera, has established liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, I think, somewhat misleading of the government to suggest that the insurance industry benefits from not having to pay such costs up-front. As the Insurance Council points out, the insurance industry does not have that option. It cannot pay such costs up-front but must wait until liability is established. Indeed, if anybody benefits under the existing system, it is the patients who are seeing doctors and the doctors themselves because they are able to be seen under the cover of Medicare and not have to worry about paying money out of their own pockets until such time as they have had claims heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in all of these circumstances it is appropriate that the insurance industry and the Commonwealth each bear its own costs of operating this scheme. In any case, I note here that many insurers, I suspect, will eventually shift to the bulkbilling arrangements that we now have in this legislation and the issue of the fee will ultimately disappear. Therefore, I suspect that the government still expressing continuing concern over our not accepting the fee is really a bit of a red herring because, in terms of the overall success or failure of this scheme, it has very little part to play whatsoever now that those bulkbilling arrangements are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have before us quite a complex proposal. There have been quite a number of compromises on all sides. I call on the government&mdash;whoever is in government at the time&mdash;to conduct in 18 months time, when the bulkbilling arrangements are ready to step in, a detailed examination of the proposal. After consultation with the industry, we may indeed be prepared again in this place to visit the possibility of further legislative action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill 1994 and related bills. I would just make some comments in relation to one particular area of these bills&mdash;and that is the practice of double dipping, or the concurrent claiming of compensation and Medicare benefits. That, unfortunately, is a commonplace practice in Australia and one which needs to be resolved as a matter of considerable importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has concerned me throughout all of this debate that has gone on since the original introduction of this legislation is, yet again, the lack of consultation the government has had with the industry concerned. We have seen this lack of consultation so many times. We have seen it in the attempts which have been made to ram the reform legislation through the parliament, without there having been any consultation with those concerned&mdash;the doctors, the hospitals and the insurers. I believe that this example of lack of consultation is even more dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Double dipping is estimated to cost the Australian taxpayer about $40 million a year. So any attempts to overcome this problem are naturally welcomed by the coalition. But it is the way in which it will be done and whether the resolution of this problem is a practical one which concerns us. That is where we have difficulty in agreeing with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the time this bill was first presented, the coalition has made the government aware of a number of concerns about the legislation&mdash;just as we have been made aware by other parties of many of the concerns about the legislation. We are now especially concerned that the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Administration Fee Bill imposes a tax on insurance, and by the types of concerns that have been raised with our shadow minister for health and human resources, Dr Michael Wooldridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this bill is that, after it passed in the House of Representatives, the coalition was approached by the Insurance Council of Australia, the Law Society and the Medical Defence Union, who wanted the bills referred to the Senate committee in order that they could express their reservations about certain aspects of the legislation. As I say, the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, as is typically the case, just refuses to consult with people in advance of what is happening with any of these pieces of legislation. So what we are confronted with every time and what appears to be the norm now is the concerned parties having to express their concern at Senate committee hearings. If we did not have that process, many of these concerns would not be aired because of the lack of consultation by the minister and her office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those industry and professional people have complained that they simply cannot even get an appointment with the minister. At times they have been told that they have to get on a plane and go to Perth to see Dr Lawrence. However, when they get on a plane and go to Perth to see Dr Lawrence, they find that they are then confronted with a meeting with her staff. They find that totally and utterly unacceptable&mdash;and I do not blame them. They have a right to express their concern, and the country has a right to expect proper legislation&mdash;and this government has a responsibility to the people of Australia to make sure that the legislation is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the concern that there had been a lack of consultation was shared in the end by the Senate committee. Nevertheless, it recommended that the bills proceed but not before further consultation occurred. As a result of that extended period of consultation, a number of further amendments were made with the effect that insurers would be allowed to make a bulk payment to the federal government of an estimated quantum of Medicare and nursing home benefit recoveries based on previous returns, in return for which the levy in most cases would be waived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the amendments, however, there are still a number of concerns which are held by various groups in the medical, legal and insurance professions. The Law Council, for example, believes that the legislation's requirement for the Health Insurance Council to be notified of the various stages of the claims process will just wreak havoc in the areas of personal injury and workers compensation. It also sees complications arising from disputes about what benefit items are associated with the injury or condition for which compensation is being sought. This process will impose significant burdens upon insurers and claimants in terms of additional time, administration and cost burdens, which the Insurance Council of Australia estimates will be in the vicinity of $30 million annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of double dipping at the moment is about $40 million annually. Therefore, the net gains that are going to be made in this are yet to really be seen and quantified to any real extent; yet the impact on the industry is going to be enormous. Once again, the responsibility is now taken away from government and put on to a third party. That will create more administration for and a greater burden on that third party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all in addition to the industry levy, estimated to deliver the government $10 million in revenue per annum to finance the Health Insurance Commission's administration. This is effectively a tax on insurers to subsidise the burgeoning Health Insurance Commission bureaucracy, with little apparent benefit to the community and the high possibility that insurance premiums and legal costs will rise if the cost is passed on to consumers. My colleague Senator Herron mentioned that before in relation to the flow-on impact in terms of third party insurance and the net effect on prices, which will be that they will simply have to go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry players are also concerned that the legislation's requirement for the Health Insurance Commission interest to be identified and settled prior to compensation payment being made has not been removed. They believe this is a costly and time consuming process. They suggest that less time and cost intensive solutions are available to overcome the problem of double dipping. Many of those less time consuming and more cost-effective solutions have now been put to the committee and, therefore, have been put to the government. But they are still closing their eyes and ears to those suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our argument is that the way in which the legislation is now drafted does not solve those problems and some of these suggestions should in fact be taken on board. The shortcomings of this current measure before us far outweigh any benefit that may have originally been thought to flow from the legislation. We would be far happier to give more in-depth consideration to proposals put forward by groups such as the Health Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Council of Australia. Those proposals are far more simple to administer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that really concerns me about this whole process of change to the Medicare legislation, to the health insurance legislation and to everything else is that there is so little consultation with anybody. When we look at the reform legislation we see that it is going to flounder. The reason it is going to flounder is the same reason this legislation will flounder. There is not a commitment from all parties that it will work and that it will be easy to work. In relation to the reform legislation, from today there are only three days before the legislation is to be implemented; yet the doctors are not prepared to sign the contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who has had a pretty close encounter with hospital bills in recent times, I have to say that the whole system needs reforming; yet the government cannot get it right. Here we are with the double dipping legislation, and they cannot get it right. I am the first one to admit that Dr Lawrence has been somewhat distracted with other matters of spending taxpayers' money on herself, as opposed to spending taxpayers' money in making sure that this legislation and previous legislation works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact of the matter is that we are not going to see this legislation take effect in any proper constructive way and that is why I draw the parallel between this piece of legislation and the reform legislation. Recently I had the opportunity of meeting with the board of directors of the St John of God Hospital in Perth. It is a very large private hospital. They expressed concern about the reform package, and understandably so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When meetings like that come hot on the heels of reports which outline the shortfall of Dr Lawrence's reforms and which point to the fact that very few doctors, if any, have negotiated with service providers to decide upon a set fee for procedures, we know that we will see the same problems with this proposed legislation today that we have seen in the other legislation. Given the opposition to that bill by the Australian Medical Association, the Council of Procedural Specialists and so forth, we now have concern being expressed by organisations such as the Insurance Council of Australia and the Law Council of Australia which are experienced with the problem of double dipping but which are just simply being ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time this government started listening to those who are prepared to offer sound, constructive advice. The whole Medicare system needs to be totally revamped. We have more and more people dropping out of private health insurance day by day because of the inadequacies of this government to really resolve the problems that are surrounding it. Here we are with this type of legislation that is designed to solve a very important problem with respect to the double dipping of compensation. This government has a responsibility to the taxpayer to get it right, and we do not believe that this is the right way to do it. </PARA>

<PARA>Amendment 1 is a definition of bulk payment agreement. Amendment 2 clarifies the definition of a claim, noting that claims must be in writing and telephone calls do not count as claims. Amendment 3 defines a small amount. Very small settlements are exempt from ordinary notice provisions and a small amount is less than the administration fee of $150. That, in light of what we have just defeated, is a bit of a puzzle. I take the opportunity while I am on my feet to remind the committee of what the Senate has just done in defeating the other bill and what it has now done consequential to this amendment. The administration of each claim is estimated to cost about $137 and it is estimated there would be slightly in excess of 70,000 claims per year to which the legislation would apply. The administrative costs in total would therefore come to $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative costs of making Medicare available to insurance claimants should be borne by the industry, because it benefits from this availability. Without access to Medicare for claimants, the insurance industry would be forced to make other arrangements or pay up-front and then attempt to make recovery from unsuccessful claimants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has argued that this administration charge is a tax&mdash;they are stretching a very long bow indeed. The charge is simply that&mdash;a charge to pick up the costs of administration for actual claims which relate to a particular insurer's business. It is interesting to note that the application of the user-pays principle&mdash;held so dearly by the opposition&mdash;seems not to hold in the case of this legislation. In this case, the opposition clearly feels that, when the insurance industry is the user, the industry should roll over and not worry about the user-pays principle. It is very clearly a piece of opposition expediency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this legislation had been implemented&mdash;it has now been defeated&mdash;the industry would have continued to benefit from holding and using the taxpayers' Medicare dollars for long periods until claims were settled. The government is not proposing to recoup the interest charged on these funds, nor will we be trying to recoup the benefits that the industry has had from the funds over the last 10 years. We were simply seeking to ensure a fair contribution to prevent a greater impost on ordinary taxpayers. I noticed as I was coming down here and when I was listening to the proceedings in my room that Senator Knowles was hot to trot for ordinary taxpayers. She has just dudded them here.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knowles, abuse across the chamber is no grace and no help at all. I should also say that I have been asked in this place on other occasions what $10,000 would buy. Let me tell you what $10 million would buy. It would buy over 1,000 hip operations, over 808 kidney transplants, over 4,200 hernia repairs or over 2,500 gall bladder operations. Alternatively, it would buy over 1,000 heart bypasses or over 5,000 cataract operations. It would certainly buy nearly 24,000 neo-natal intensive care unit bed days. So I am glad that the opposition is profligate with the taxpayers' dollars and believes that those dollars are better off locked in the insurance funds than paid out on behalf of the cost of administering claims. This is not a tax that you have defeated, but a charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 4 clarifies the date of injury in relation to disease cases. There is always confusion about definitions of an injury and a disease. What we want to make clear here is that, if a person is suffering from a compensable disease, it is said to have started on the day first medical treatment was rendered. The definition was in the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Administration Fee Bill, but will have been placed in the main bill with other definitions. Subclause 3(10) tells how to determine a period of bulk payment arrangement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for the explanations. I requested them because I wanted to bring home to the minister the complexity of the arrangements that have been put forward by the government.

It illustrates that, even with the explanatory memorandum, the government does not know what it is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It started out with a laudable aim, which was to recover the payments under Medicare. Now we have got into this gobbledegook which was in the explanatory memorandum. There needs to be a course in simple English for those who compose supplementary memoranda. I have illustrated this on many previous occasions. This is an explanatory memorandum to an explanatory memorandum. I know, when the government brings in 37 separate amendments, it needs to have a further explanation of them. What we have just gone through is another classic illustration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the five amendments I have circulated  is to make provision for reduction of the double dipping effect in situations where parties reach a compromise to reduce their risk&mdash;for example, a settlement for less than desired rather than nothing, which can happen in personal injury cases&mdash;which leads to a reduced award without the admission of contributory negligence or apportioned blame. In other words, if an injured person seeks a compromise settlement, they can achieve that at a lower figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that there are legitimate concerns about the fact that this bill ignores compromise settlements. It seems only fair that the interests of these parties be taken into account and that the parliament not compromise the abilities of these parties to reach a lower compromise settlement if that is their negotiated desire. You should not make the assumption that, if the lower payment is achieved, in some way the insurance companies are inhibiting the ability of the person to achieve adequate compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that there is a possibility that such compromises will be less attractive if the recovery of Medicare or nursing home benefits in compensated situations cannot be adjusted in the same way for these as it will be for apportioned settlements. There is an equity factor in relation to the injured parties. There is also the principle behind these amendments, as we see it, of minimising this legislation's interference with common law, third party and workers compensation processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, we do not want to stop the parties doing anything that they would be doing to achieve a favourable outcome in the compensation system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bills deal with cases where the judgment or settlement fixes the amount of compensation on the basis that liability for the injury should be apportioned between the parties. Where there is some apportionment of liability and the amount of compensation is reduced because of it, the amount owing to the Commonwealth will be reduced by a similar proportion. This is fair because Medicare has some underlying obligation to pay benefits for eligible services which are not covered by a compensation payout.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, apportioning liability means that only a portion of the claims is the responsibility of the compensation payer; the remainder is the responsibility of the claimant and, hence, would be covered by Medicare benefits. It is on this basis that the Commonwealth is prepared to reduce the amount charged for Medicare and nursing home benefits in a similar proportion to the agreed apportionment of liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition want the Commonwealth to also reduce its charge where settlements occur for reasons other than an apportionment of liability&mdash;for example, where a claimant chooses to settle because of the perceived risks of litigation; perhaps their main witness has not turned up or is not very credible; or the judge is said to be tough on plaintiffs. Perhaps they just want their money quickly and are not prepared to wait for trial. Such factors are highly subjective and cannot be quantified, as the opposition suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the bill stands, in cases where an apportionment of liability is not involved, the claimant's debt to the Commonwealth is not reduced. These claimants must make their decisions about going to trial or settling knowing that they owe a debt to the Commonwealth for their Medicare and nursing home expenses. The opposition says that this is not fair as in these cases the other parties take a discount on what they might otherwise have got by going to court and the Commonwealth should share this reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not precisely true. While one or other of the parties to the matter may settle for a greater or lesser amount than would have been the case had they proceeded to court, not everybody does. For example, neither the claimant's nor the insurer's lawyers take a discount on their fees in these cases; nor do the doctors who provided the medical care or the various experts who provided reports or evidence about the case. All of these people expect to receive full payment of their costs, irrespective of whether the claimant settles for a reduced amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accepting a settlement offer, the claimant has to weigh up the pros and cons and take into account the extent of their total debts arising from the claim. Medicare and nursing home benefits paid by the Commonwealth are no different in this instance to other debts and should be paid irrespective of the risk of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth cannot allow its debtors to trade off that debt because of other subjective considerations. In effect, the opposition amendments invite the parties to manufacture a notion of risk in order to evade a legitimate debt to the Commonwealth. There is no accountability and no transparency in this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`An agreed compromise of the risks' is totally arbitrary and totally unquantifiable. What does this concept mean? For a start, in order for the legislation to work based on a compromise of risks, this term would need to be defined. The opposition has not provided any such definition. The opposition amendments would turn the provisions into a lottery. The opposition amendments are so open ended that in practical terms the provisions would be dangerous. Who knows what the term `agreed compromise of the risks of the parties' actually means? Does even the opposition know what it means?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very essence of a settlement is that it is a compromise on the basis of an assessed risk, so the effect of the opposition amendments would be to reduce the amount to be repaid to the taxpayer in every case which is settled. Rather than preventing double dipping, which is the intent of the legislation, the opposition amendments would actually encourage it. How can the parties sensibly agree about what their risks are?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plaintiff will make a totally different assessment of his or her risks to that of the compensation payer. They are coming from totally different directions on this matter. How can they sensibly agree without some element of connivance? The larger the debt to Medicare, the greater the incentive there is for the parties to connive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me paint a hypothetical picture to demonstrate how dangerous these opposition amendments can be. Take a hypothetical case where there is a debt to Medicare of $50,000. In this case, the medical components are a significant component of the claim. In part, because of this debt the claimant wants at least $100,000 to settle the claim; that is, he or she wants a net $50,000. The insurer is not prepared to go higher than $80,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terms of the opposition amendment, it is quite legitimate for the insurer to agree to a much higher figure by using the taxpayers' money to make up the difference. That is how it works. The parties agree that based on an assessment of the risks the amount they settle on is only 50 per cent of what might have been achieved in a judgment; that is, they agree that the settlement amount would have been $160,000 instead of $80,000. This means that Medicare only gets 50 per cent or $25,000 of its debt, while the insurance company and the claimant give up nothing. The insurer only pays $80,000&mdash;the amount they were prepared to pay at the start of the negotiations. The claimant gets $80,000 but only has to pay Medicare $25,000, leaving the claimant a net $55,000&mdash;$5,000 more than her original starting point in this hypothetical case. The only losers are the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would be the usual course of settlements under the opposition scheme. These arrangements would quickly become institutionalised&mdash;a set of entrenched gaming principles which govern the process of settlement in compensation cases. In addition, the amendments as moved do not even make sense. Opposition amendment No. 3 appears to change the wrong clause in the bill. Our best guess is that the opposition probably means to amend clause 23(4), relating to government amendment 24, not clause 21. We do think that that needs to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 21 deals with the notice of past benefits given by the Health Insurance Commission to the insurer. Subclause 4(b) specifies one of the things the notice has to say. Opposition amendment No. 3 would replace the subclause with a requirement on a totally different notice; that is, the notice of settlement or judgment given to the commission by the parties. Further, the opposition amendments return to an arrangement that the legal profession have told the government just will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government amendment No. 24 amended a previously circulated government amendment dealing with the arrangements for notifying the Health Insurance Commission about settlements or judgments which involve some apportionment of liability. The amendment was made on the basis of advice from the New South Wales Law Society that the previous amendment was not workable. Their advice was that, although it is usual for there to be some acknowledgment that some apportionment has taken place, it is not usual for that to be quantified in terms of the compensation amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised government amendment provides for the reduction due to apportionment of liability to be expressed in percentage terms only. While this would enable the Health Insurance Commission to deduce what the amount would have been, it would not require the parties to attest to a figure that did not really exist. Opposition amendment No. 3 requires the parties to state what the amount would have been if there was no apportionment or adjustment; that is, a return to an arrangement that the legal profession has told us will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all senses these amendments represent bad legislation. Technically, they are unworkable. In practice, they would hamper the ability of a government to administer and monitor the scheme but, more importantly, they provide an incentive for the parties to behave in an unprincipled manner. They give a legitimate debt to the taxpayers the same status as a wager at a casino. They virtually guarantee that every compensation case that goes to settlement will involve a reduction in the amount due to the taxpayer and this money will be pocketed by the insurance industry. This amounts to a sizeable ongoing subsidy from the taxpayer to the insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill as it stands provides for some fair discounting of the Commonwealth's debt when there is some genuine sharing of liability. The government is not trying to evade that, but the opposition amendments create a dangerous and unworkable arrangement which encourages dishonesty and open manipulation of a genuine debt to the taxpayers. You have just given them at least $10 million by defeating the first bill. Think again, Senator. </PARA>

I would certainly have liked to have consulted further, particularly with the insurance industry, before moving to support them at this point. But I will say two things. The first relates to complexity. When the government indicated it really was serious about this problem and was about to do something about it, it set about collecting a lot of the details and the data we are now going to get as this proceeds. If we had had a decent database in the first place, we could now move directly to bulk-billing. We are 18 months down the track and we are going to have to wait another 18 months for the simpler solution to be put in place.

She mentioned a hypothetical sum and then went forward and developed from that an argument that, somehow or another, the taxpayer was going to be affected by this and that this was a mechanism whereby the taxpayer would be affected because somebody was going to go in collusion. It is a classic example of not understanding what occurs out in the real world. It is all very well in this whoopeeland around here, but in reality, out there in the market, genuine arrangements are made between people to achieve a negotiated settlement. There is no collusion. It is a responsible attempt to achieve a compromise whereby compensation is achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is quite a simple one. It relates to the delegation power of the authorisation power of the minister. I feel a sense of confidence that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee would have raised this matter, although I have not had the opportunity to check the report. They usually do when someone has the power to appoint a person and there is no restriction on the categories of persons. I wonder whether you can confirm for me that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has done that and tell me what the government's response is to that.</PARA></TALK.START>

But if it is still in the form that it originally was, then I think that means the minister can appoint any Tom, Dick or Harry without any limitation at all. Minister, perhaps you could assist me in that respect. That is really the only question we want to tease out. We do not want to pursue it today. If it is a broad power to authorise, as I suspect it is, we just want to flag that we think it is inappropriate and that you should at some stage&mdash;not that you will get the opportunity, because you will not be in government long enough to do it&mdash;restrict the category of persons that the Attorney-General can authorise, or we will do it in a law and justice legislation amendment bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we have before us the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment and Repeal Bill. This is a matter which, by way of good housekeeping, gives attention to administrative changes and anomalies. As the former shadow minister for veterans' affairs, it has been made very clear to me that it is an area in which one constantly finds anomalies. They can be of great importance to a handful of individuals. It is often quite a long time before the bureaucracy and the government recognise the importance of doing something about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see the removal of anomalies in this legislation. I am glad to see that they are being attended to. I would not want the Senate to think that this was the be-all and end-all. I visited an ex-servicemen's club only last week, and they presented me with a list of more anomalies that need attention. I have now handed that list to the shadow minister, Mr Tuckey. Mr Tuckey has consulted widely on this piece of legislation before us today. As a result, the opposition is pleased to support the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does a number of things by way of minor amendments to a large amount of legislation covering veterans' affairs. Although the changes are small, there are some which are welcome, including the extension of the remote area allowance to veterans living on Norfolk and Lord Howe islands. Other amendments relate to assessments of service pension and income support supplements. They include the calculation of child related payments and&mdash;I think this is of particular importance&mdash;rent assistance for certain blind pensioners as well as for certain war widows and war widows in receipt of a frozen rate of service pension. Those arrangements that have been in place until now have long been inequitable. I am very glad to see that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also amendments covering participation in local exchange trading systems as well as allowing the carers of service pensioners accompanying veterans overseas to keep receiving their carers' pension for up to three months of their absence from Australia. The bill also sets a closing date of 30 November 1994 for Somalia as an operational area. That has been an operational area for veterans' entitlements purposes since 20 October 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill repeals two acts&mdash;the War Service Homes Agreement Act 1932 and the War Service Homes (South Australia) Agreement Act 1934, which have apparently both served their useful purpose and we do not object to their repeal. A feature of any debate on veterans' affairs in the Senate or in the other place during this year has been the unanimous support across political lines for the Australia Remembers program. I am obviously more than happy to endorse that program, especially as I am the wife of a veteran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War has been a special moment in the history of this country. It is an opportunity for the generation who fought the war to reflect on their experiences and to remember those who gave their lives for the country. It is also an opportunity for us to reflect on that service. It is very much an opportunity for later generations to gain an insight into something which we hope they never have to experience&mdash;the horrors of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been particularly pleased about the number of schools and schoolchildren who have been involved in the Australia Remembers project because I think that shows a recognition by schools that war service is an important area of Australian history for children to learn about. That has not been the case in past generations. It gives those Australians who have enjoyed the fruits of peace an appreciation of how peace was won and how it has not always been the natural state of affairs in this world of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting, as did the Yale historian Donald Kagan in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">On the Origins of War</EMPHASIS>, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past two centuries the only thing more common than predictions about the end of war has been war itself.</PARA>
<PARA>Kagan said that in the last 3,421 years only 268 have been free of war and none of those years have been since 1968. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as we have a duty to remember the sacrifice of a previous generation and to care for the veterans of those earlier wars, as this legislation is doing, we must also be conscious of what we can do to prevent another major conflict, as we had with the Second World War. The best way to ensure that another generation of Australians is never subjected to the horror and hardships of war which we have remembered this year is to make sure that we are seen as having a strong defence capability. Deterrent is very much the best way to maintain the peace. We must be able to send a signal to would-be aggressors that Australia is ready and willing to defend its territory and its citizens at home and abroad. Our message has to be that we can defend ourselves and defend ourselves well so that any attack on Australia would be a futile exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the current government, while celebrating Australia Remembers, has actually forgotten what the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War is all about. It is very timely for a commemoration of what that brave generation achieved. We sent many of those men away ill-trained and ill-equipped. We must never do that to young Australians again. This should be a year for us all to declare never again to put young serving people in that position. We should focus in a practical way on what we can do now in making wise decisions to build on the hard won gains of earlier generations and to maintain the peace for us and for our region. I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the opposition for its support on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment and Repeal Bill 1995. As Senator Newman has outlined and as contained in the second reading speech in reasonable detail, the bill rectifies anomalies in certain assessments of service pension and income support, matters relating to child related payments, rent assistance for certain blind pensioners, carers of service pensioners who accompany a veteran overseas, remote area allowances and a number of other matters such as the operational area closing date in Somalia. These are small but important and significant changes to those people who are affected by the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree with Senator Newman that we have forgotten what the 50th anniversary is all about. I think all credit should go to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for the Australia Remembers celebration of the end of the war in the Pacific. I notice that yesterday he received life membership of the RSL in recognition of the tremendous work he did in the Australia Remembers area. I was with Minister Sciacca on a number of occasions socially. In the middle of the occasions I was with him, his mobile phone would ring or a staff member would come up and start talking to him about arrangements for Australia Remembers. I have never seen a minister devote so much time and energy to a part of their portfolio responsibilities as Con Sciacca. The minister deserves recognition, as the RSL has done, for his tremendous efforts in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I endorse the remarks that Senator Newman made about reflecting on our experiences and what we learnt from World War II&mdash;and the other wars that have occurred in Australia's past&mdash;and, particularly, from the end of the war in the Pacific. It was also very pleasing to me to see many of our schools joining in the various remembrance activities with such enthusiasm. I think that is very important. War should not be remembered for war's sake, but we should certainly reflect on the causes and the outcomes of war. I think the Australia Remembers campaign gave very appropriate recognition to our various service personnel. My father served in the merchant navy from 1939 to, I think, the late 1940s and it certainly made me think a little more deeply about some of the experiences he has talked to me about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1995 is to provide a late payment component of the superannuation levy calculated for months commencing in the period between the time the superannuation fund was due to lodge a return and when it was actually lodged. Superannuation fund trustees may be requested to pay two components&mdash;a basic component and, if it is lodged late, a late lodgment penalty. Honourable senators may be aware that in 1992 the basic levy was increased very substantially to cover the enhanced prudential requirements. Also, this basic component of the levy has two elements itself, a lodgment fee and an amount based on the total of the funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lodgment fee of $300 for unit trusts. In addition, there is a levy of $200 per $500,000 of investments or part of $500,000 of assets held by the fund. This late lodgment fee is payable where the period of grace has expired and a return is due to be lodged. The period of grace currently provides that the late payment penalty will not apply where the return is made and the basic levy amount is paid within 14 days commencing on the day after the levy was payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The late payment levy is currently payable for each levy month that commences after the expiration of the period of grace until the return is lodged and the levy paid. The amendment contained in this bill before the Senate will remove the exception for any month that commences during the period of grace so that the late payment levy will be payable in respect of each month that commences after the date of lodgment rather than for months commencing after the end of the period of grace. So, according to the explanatory memorandum of the bill, the change is expected to have no impact on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a look at the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Hon. Paul Elliott, when this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives. I noticed that, in the very short two-page speech, there was only one paragraph&mdash;and that was the final paragraph&mdash;that actually related to the bill itself. The rest of the speech related to superannuation in general. That provides a precedent and the opportunity to range a bit more widely than the particular portion of the bill, which is effectively a very small component. My colleague the shadow minister responsible for the legislation, Mr Connolly, did exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that, this afternoon, the Commissioner of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is holding a function to say farewell to a very distinguished member of the commission, Mr Ron Dean, Deputy Commissioner of the Superannuation Group. Mr Dean is retiring after an illustrious career of some 47 years in the Public Service. He will retire on 29 September. It is appropriate that there is a function at the Canberra International Hotel this afternoon. I have been privileged to be invited to attend that particular function, which will farewell Ron and wish him a happy retirement. Indeed, 47 years is a long time and I must pay tribute to him. He has contributed significantly to the development of superannuation. He was at the commission from its inception. I place on the public record my appreciation of his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Elliott also referred to some of the achievements of the government. One of those achievements was to embark on a public education campaign to promote the benefits of superannuation savings for retirement. The government actually set aside $12.5 million for this. While it is true that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended that additional funds be set aside for the purpose of education, I am a little worried about the bias of this particular campaign. As I read it, it has an overly political flavour and I think this is unfortunate. I think what really was required was a proper educative campaign so that people are not only aware of the benefits of superannuation but are also aware of the responsibilities and other issues that are associated with superannuation. If there is to be a second or further addition, I would hope that the political flavour is somewhat more removed than what we have seen to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be unfortunate if the government used superannuation as an election tool in the next six months. Superannuation is certainly for the long term and during an election fever all sorts of promises are made. Superannuation must be examined more critically and more carefully than would the case in a lead-up to an election when rash promises are often made. I certainly hope that the gains that have been made in relation to superannuation for the benefit of the Australian taxpayer can be sustained and that superannuation is not turned into a political issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in superannuation is that this government has what I term privatised public pensions. In other words, it has largely been put across to the public sector. While there have undoubtedly been winners in the long term, there have certainly been losers, and one of the losers has been the low income earner. I think we are expecting a little too much from superannuation. Certainly, the Liberal side of politics is very keen to look at alternative savings vehicles and I think this is the right approach. While it is essential that there be very strong prudential controls in relation to superannuation, I think these other savings vehicles could suit the needs of low income earners and others. Perhaps a one size fits all approach may provide the sort of flexibility that is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports this legislation but it is very conscious of the need to extend the coverage of superannuation and, at the same time, keep costs down. In the process, I think it is necessary that there be mechanisms not only to ensure the prudential security of the funds which are being well established at the present time but also to ensure that people do not get locked in indefinitely to poorly performing funds. If this is to be the case, we have to have mechanisms which will encourage the merger of funds and provide easier opportunities at appropriate times for people to move from one fund to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a great supporter of the concept of portability of superannuation, something that tends to follow you round. While exit fees certainly are coming down in personal superannuation, they are, unfortunately, still a problem. Nevertheless, there are situations where it is difficult for certain people, when changing jobs, to exit from certain industry funds. I think this is unfortunate and certainly needs to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take any more of the Senate's time because we have other important legislation coming up which I would like to see quickly passed by the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few concluding remarks in picking up some of the comments that Senator Watson has touched on, and I am cognisant of the time factor here today. Prior to Senator Watson obtaining the position as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, I held the position. I have always acknowledged that Senator Watson has played a commendable, generally bipartisan&mdash;as bipartisan as one can get in politics&mdash;role in this superannuation debate and in the various issues that have been discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of extending the coverage of superannuation, I am glad to hear the coalition is interested in doing this. This government has a commendable record of extending coverage from less than 40 per cent a decade ago when superannuation was generally the preserve of those with higher income, and generally excluded low income workers, women, part-timers and casuals in this country. We have seen the coverage grow, as a consequence of our policies, to over 90 per cent of Australian employees. I think the last area of coverage that has to be addressed is the sole business operator. Many of them have personal superannuation but many do not because they often regard their business as a form of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of costs, the industry funds generally have offered a very cost-effective and appropriate mechanism for efficient administration of superannuation savings. There have been criticisms of personal products, but there have been significant reforms in this area to keep pressures on costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson's suggestion about the merger of funds is one I support. My personal view is that the government should be more pro-active in this area, particularly where we have illogical artificial funds, in the sense that we have a number of hospitality funds, and there is not a rationale for having separate funds. That does not necessarily lead to better returns; whether you have got one large fund or 10 small ones, it does not necessarily mean that the returns will be better. The critical issue is that the trustees are doing their job and, if the areas where they are investing the money are not showing an appropriate return, they should change the mix of investment. This is where the role of trustees is critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson referred to the losers being people on lower incomes. I am not sure what Senator Watson means because our policy is very clear; we preserve the basic old age pension, as it is known. The pension is the minimum safety net and anything in addition that has contributed to the various superannuation funds is over and above, subject to means testing. It is not the government's intention&mdash;I say this on most occasions that I speak on this issue&mdash;to do away with the basic pension. The issue of superannuation addresses a number of fundamental issues, including the ageing population and the issue of the savings of this country. This country's savings is a very important issue in relation to debt, but I am not going to go into that today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join you, Senator Watson, in recognising the service of Mr Ron Dean.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In formulating the outcome of the bill, a key role was played by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which is required to deal with the issue of per capita relativities as a measure of the relative needs of the states and territories. In arriving at an outcome, the Commonwealth Grants Commission is charged with the responsibility of deciding on the level of expenditure required to provide a standard level of service. The general revenue assistance comes in three categories: financial assistance grants; special revenue assistance grants; and identified roads grants. Since 1991-92 Commonwealth funding of local roads, which was classified as special purpose payments, is now provided as general revenue assistance to be used as the states see fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the bill in the short time we have today, the opportunity should not be lost to bring home to the government a few home truths about their lopsided approach to providing financial assistance to states and territories. The level of general revenue assistance is estimated to be $15.074 billion in 1994-95 and $15.713 billion in l995-96. On the face of it, the government has claimed that this represents an increase of 4.21 per cent over the last year. As usual, they fail to say there will be no increase in real terms if inflation runs at three per cent and the population increase is around 1.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of further concern is the fact that the government has chosen to raise its own expenditure from $81.988 billion in l993-94 to $88.092 billion in l994-95. This is an increase of $6.1 billion, or seven per cent. Overall the Commonwealth has increased its own expenditure by 2.5 per cent in real terms whilst continuing to squeeze the states and territories. History shows that under this Labor government there has been an ongoing decline in the level of payments by the Commonwealth to state and territory governments. In my own state, since this Labor government has been in power we are about $400 million worse off in real terms than we were when they came into power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has chosen to increase its own outlays as a proportion of the total budget outlay by 11 per cent rising from 66.8 per cent in 1983-84 to 74.2 per cent in 1995-96. At the same time, there has been a contrasting 22 per cent fall in the total payments to states and territories from 33.1 per cent to 25.6 per cent for the same period. The fiscal imbalance is also of concern and it has been caused by this government through its blatant abuse of section 96 tied grants. The level of tied grants has increased by over 37 per cent since 1983-84, severely restricting the ability of the state and territory governments to deal with their financial commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another myth about the Labor government which this bill exposes is its horrendous record in relation to taxation. This bill projects an increase in the government's taxation revenue from $105.304 billion in 1994-95 to $119.261 billion in 1995-96, an increase of a massive $13.957 billion. Whilst the government is going to slug the long suffering Australian taxpayer almost $14 billion only 1.4 billion of those dollars will be passed on to the states. This leaves the states with a serious financial disadvantage in that their ability to raise taxation revenue is seriously limited by the $14 billion slug of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), yet the government continues to tighten restrictions which apply to the states in terms of how they may use their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I leave this bill, I want to draw the Senate's attention again to the greed of this government in relation to the long suffering motorist. Of the 33c which this government collects in fuel tax, only 7c is returned to the road network. In other words, 26c goes into the government's coffers. The rest is used to prop up the government and its lavish spending programs. Let there be no mistake&mdash;this is a high tax, big spending government bill which, in the long run, does little to provide meaningful assistance to the states and territories and even less to remove the terrible taxation burden which rests on the shoulders of the Australian community. </PARA>

The areas that are being considered under general purposes are areas which were outlined quite accurately by Senator Calvert.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not share Senator Calvert's expressed concern that the level of tied grants has risen over recent years. In fact, a number of people from my electorate have told me that they would actually prefer tied grants to come from the Commonwealth, because they can see the purpose for which the money is intended and they are able to monitor whether it is actually expended in that area. The general impression given to me is that people would rather see the Commonwealth government give money to an area where the state government is unable to hide it in some other hollow logs or, in the case of Tasmania, grant a 40 per cent pay increase to members of parliament in that state. This is a matter of great contention and resentment in my electorate in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the question of priorities, some would argue that matters that directly concern state governments are best left to the state governments. Of course, others argue that there is more opportunity for state governments to be influenced by vested interests, who take away the opportunity for real needs to be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that this is a general purposes states grants amendment bill, but I am going to take this opportunity to suggest that the area of greatest need that has been brought to my attention in recent days&mdash;and is consistent with my concerns for many years&mdash;is the area of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the expressions to me about tied grants came from my attendance at the Tasmanian State School Parents and Friends Association's annual meeting recently in Tasmania. The feeling that education was not being well funded and properly funded, from either a state or Commonwealth government perspective, was unanimous and the belief that it was the responsibility of government, no matter what sort, to recognise the obligation to properly fund education was also unanimous. To take this opportunity to speak during the passage of a general purposes states grants bill is not something that I think I should apologise for when I believe that most senators would have received communications such as the letter that I just opened as I came in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a letter from the Tumby Bay Area School, Tumby Bay, South Australia. They wrote to me expressing their concern that the director of the education centre for the western area had informed the writer of the letter, who is the chairperson of the Tumby Bay Area School council, that Commonwealth funding to the centre would be discontinued from January 1997. The education centre is in Whyalla and is a leader of the professional development of teachers in the area. That is not an isolated letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other senators would probably have received bundles similar to the one that I have with me, which is addressed variously to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) and others. We have been included in these correspondences because of the frustration of people who are concerned about the closure of such education centres.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, that is something that we should be taking notice of, rather than just passing glibly over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a letter from the Parents and Friends Association from Tasman District High School at Nubeena in Tasmania. They write expressing their concern about cutbacks in teacher numbers, the inequity between funding for primary and secondary schools, larger class sizes, reduced curriculum choice in high schools and colleges, loss of many state school sports programs, the closing of many community based libraries, the lack of specialist teachers and guidance officers, and education expenditure which is ranked low in the rating of OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are not particularly concerned with the niceties of whether it is a state or a federal government obligation which is not being met. What they know is that the obligation is being avoided. They see that, because there was the opportunity to fund particular programs&mdash;and there were eight programs listed from Nubeena&mdash;and all they see are the programs disappearing. Therefore, they would not be concerned if it was a tied grant from the Commonwealth which said, `This money must be spent on a school sport program,' or `This money must be spent on a library program.' That would not be their concern, but they would be pleased to see the obligation being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is, as I have said several times in this chamber, that, when these obligations are not met by governments, they have to be met by somebody and the temptation for many school councils is to accept the offer from private sponsors. I see a great deal of threat in those offerings because what we see is that sponsors who enter the education field are there, of course, to promote their corporate wellbeing and to eventually derive some benefit from it. Philanthropy is not very common in our modern society and it is very hard to find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of a cartoon which I saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> a couple of days ago. It had a blackboard, it had Einstein wandering off to the left and he had left behind, in his fairly recognisable scrawl, E=MC squared. The `M' in this case was the `golden arches' M and the `C' was in the form of a very small `c' as you would see in `Mc'. The punch line of the cartoon read `Education equals a Big Mac?' and underneath was written: `Sponsorship of education facilities by fast food outlets has been going on for years.' I think that is a very telling cartoon, as many cartoons are, and it gives us the message in a way that shows what we really need to be wary of. That is, that where governments do not recognise their responsibilities, they leave a gap which will be filled by those who would like to call the tune; by those who would like to determine what sort of education is provided and what sorts of values our schools inculcate in the students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use this opportunity to suggest that concern about tied grants is not a concern that is held by the people who talk to me. As a matter of fact, a lot of people would prefer to see Commonwealth money coming in to meet the needs which are not being met by state governments which, quite frankly, have agendas and priorities which do not serve education well. With that, I make no further comment on the bill. The Democrats will be supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1995 is for general revenue assistance to the states and territories for 1995 and 1996. As such, it is one of the tools of our federation and it is used to return to the states some of the balance resulting from the government's continuing mismanagement of Commonwealth-state relations. I will refer to that shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suffice it to say that the bill gives effect to certain arrangements agreed to at the Premiers Conference held on 11 April this year. Those arrangements included the maintenance of the real per capita guarantee for financial assistance grants in 1995-96 and the adoption of the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on general revenue grant relativities 1995: an update</EMPHASIS> to determine the 1995-96 distribution of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants. As such, as Senator Calvert mentioned, the bill deals with financial assistance grants, special revenue assistance grants and identified road grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An aspect which I wish to raise today is the more general question relating to the financial relations between the states and the Commonwealth. In this regard, it is worth while to look at some history. In 1901 specific powers were vested in the Commonwealth and they were set out in section 51 of the constitution. These involved such areas as overseas trade, currency, defence, external affairs, customs and excise and so on. In relation to the states, the reserve powers were left for the states and they numbered such matters as roads, law and order, health and matters of that sort. Since 1901 the Commonwealth powers have grown immensely, and normally at the expense of the responsibilities of the states. Such means as tied grants have been a useful mechanism for the Commonwealth to increase its powers. This is where such legislation as the bill before us has relevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just point to statistics from 1901-02 which reveal that the Commonwealth received 58 per cent of revenue at that time whilst the states received 42 per cent. That is, the states received nearly half the revenue in the country. Of that total amount, the Commonwealth government spent only 13 per cent compared to 87 per cent by the states. Basically, at federation the states provided most of the services to the people of Australia. By 1992-93, however, the Commonwealth received 75 per cent of revenue whilst the states received only 25 per cent. Of this, the Commonwealth spent 54 per cent compared to 46 per cent by the states. In other words, the Commonwealth, since federation, has increased its revenue by roughly 50 per cent but on the other hand has increased its share of spending by 300 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where you see an interesting figure in relation to this bill. You see that the revenue assistance here to the states has increased by 4.2 per cent since last year whilst the Commonwealth has increased its own purpose outlays seven per cent. That is, the increase the Commonwealth has afforded to itself over the last year exceeds inflation whilst the increase afforded to the states merely matches inflation or would be slightly in front. I would estimate that the increase that is given in the revenue assistance grants really counts for nought when measured against inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aspect of tied grants, which Senator Bell touched on, indicates just how dependent the states have become in relation to the Commonwealth government. In 1972-73, 26 per cent of the states' money from the Commonwealth came from tied grants. Twenty-one years later, in 1995-96, this had doubled to 54.8 per cent. That is, the tied grants had doubled in the space of some 20-odd years. These are grants which the Commonwealth gives to a state and says, `There is a condition attached. There are strings attached to this grant. You can have the money but you can't necessarily spend it on anything that we don't want you to spend it on.' That is the gist of tied grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A current example is the tied grant dealing with coastal care. The Commonwealth provided a national grant of $26 million over four years for coastal care around the various states. Attached to that grant was the requirement by the Commonwealth that the states not carry out capital works such as jetties or groynes. This is despite the states and local councils having to match Commonwealth expenditure with $2 for each Commonwealth dollar granted. I put it to the Senate that that is a vivid example of how tied grants have worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask ourselves, when we look at these states grants general purposes bills and legislation which we face each year, what is being done to rectify this federal imbalance. Are we to continue to face the coercive form of federalism that this government enjoys, or are we to operate under a cooperative system of federalism, where the states cooperate not only with each other but with the Commonwealth government? I would suggest that it is entirely in the interests of the Australian people that federation be based on cooperation and not coercion. In his headland speech in Canberra on 6 June 1995, John Howard stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In government, the coalition will allocate a fixed percentage of the tax revenue to the states. We will revert to the practice of former coalition governments of winding back section 96 for specific grants to the states. That will mean the states themselves will have greater freedom of choice when deciding their progress and priority.</PARA>
<PARA>You could not be more detailed about policy than that. That is a clear statement to the people of Australia that the coalition will embark upon a principle of cooperative federalism; that is, that the coalition in government will wind back the system of tied grants, Senator Sherry, and that we will revert to a form of federation that our founding fathers foreshadowed and looked forward to in 1901. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1995. As Senator Ellison has just been saying, this bill highlights the importance of the financial relationship between the federal, state and territory governments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General revenue assistance to the states is estimated at $15.713 billion in this financial year, and the main form of this assistance is the financial assistance grants, or untied grants, which will amount to $14.857 billion in 1995-96. However, there are other forms of grants: namely, special revenue assistance grants which supplement basic general revenue assistance, and identified road grants. The last of these, the identified road grants, is one aspect that I wish to dwell on today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been approached on many occasions over a long period of time&mdash;almost 11 years in this Senate&mdash;by people in very remote parts of Western Australia, metropolitan Perth, and, more recently, the state Minister for Transport, Mr Eric Charlton. All of these people have been very concerned about the lack of road funding in real terms that is coming back to Western Australia. Mr Charlton has led a vigorous campaign to secure more road funding in Western Australia to help maintain and develop arterial roads in our state. The fact of the matter is, when it comes to this government, that campaign is hitting a brick wall. The funding has been going down all the time while the income for the federal government has been going up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to me is section 15 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994 which ties road funding to compulsory student unionism. To the casual onlooker, anyone would say that the two have no relativity whatsoever. When it comes to this government, it is a nice little piece of blackmail that was brought in last year and we are paying the price in Western Australia day by day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, if a person allows students the choice to join a student union or guild, then in return from the government they can expect road funding to be cut. That is a scandal. The extra money will go to help the guilds that have been turned into voluntary student guilds make up their shortfall in the membership dues following the departure of many of those students with the freedom of choice that the state Liberal government has provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken about this issue before. It is one which concerns not only me and my Western Australian colleagues but also many students and young people in Western Australia.

It is just like the ACTU, and Joan Kirner coming out today and admitting that the ACTU is an arm of the Labor Party.

It constitutes a gross mismanagement of Commonwealth-state relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia has 25 per cent of the length of the national highway. You would imagine that a federal government would be concerned about that&mdash;but not this federal government. The state government estimates that $139 million will be needed each year over the next 10 years to maintain those highways, while an extra $145 million will be needed each year to meet the demands of new road networks. A firm commitment to road funding from the federal government is important, but it is one that we simply cannot expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia is, after all, a rapidly expanding state. Perth is one of the fastest growing state capitals, second only to Brisbane. Western Australia contains the fastest growing municipality in Australia: namely, the city of Wanneroo, in the northern corridor of the Perth metropolitan area. With the state's population continuing to grow and the number of road users increasing, the wear and tear on our roads will also increase. In the next 10 years, 30 per cent of Western Australian roads will be due for replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It stands to reason that that is going to require a huge capital outlay. But it seems that the members of this government are more intent on spending the extra money on propping up student unions&mdash;now, while they can&mdash;because they know that, come the next election, they will not be there to fund those student unions any longer. It will be up to a coalition government to ensure that there is a return to proper road funding throughout Australia and, particularly, in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, this government is not interested in a more equitable return for fuel excises. I will just go through a few of the figures that are part of the alleged commitment to not increase taxes that was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in 1993. Prior to the last election, fuel excise&mdash;a tax&mdash;was 26.2c a litre. By February 1994, less than 12 months later, it was 30.75c for unleaded fuel and 31.75c for leaded fuel. This is from a government that promised not to increase taxes. It went from 26.2c to 31.75c in less than 12 months. Of course, in February this year it climbed to 32.5c for unleaded and 34.57c per litre for leaded. This, once again, is from a government that promised not to increase taxes. That is a tax. Fuel excise it nothing but a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the return to the states' road funds has not reflected any of that increase at all. Who knows what this extra revenue will be spent on? It certainly will not be spent on the national highway system, and it certainly is not coming back to Western Australia. Of course, Western Australia deserves a fair share of that increase in fuel excise, because of the sheer distances that Western Australians have to travel. But, instead, the federal government tells the states they will have to be content with a 7c per litre return from the tax grab at the petrol bowsers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember that it was this Labor Party that opposed the introduction of fuel excise in the first place. They said it was just another tax at the bowser. Well, they have had their snouts in the trough ever since. They have just been increasing it and making sure that the average motorist thinks that it is the fuel companies that have increased the price of petrol. The difference is made up by the people of the state&mdash;through other levies, excises, taxes and charges&mdash;but it is the federal government which erects the massive, green and gold `federally funded road project' signs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those signs absolutely make many people cringe. They see the quality of their roads deteriorating, they know they are paying more taxes and charges and they know they are paying more fuel tax every time they fill up their cars at the bowser. Yet this federal government has got the gall and audacity to erect huge green and gold signs saying that any road work is being federally funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know I am not the only one who cringes at these, because of the number of complaints that I get from constituents who simply say, `If the federal government is not returning the money, why should it have the joy of erecting these signs?' It is offensive, it is misleading and it should be stopped. But the only way it will be stopped will be by this mob being thrown out at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least they are a sign that roads are being repaired or created but who is paying the bill? That is the question. The fewer of these signs we see, the more obvious it will be that less and less money is being spent on road maintenance. Or perhaps we will be able to read into that that the student unions on Western Australian university campuses will be getting the spoils. It is encouraging that there has been a noticeable improvement in road safety in Western Australia in recent years but that is not thanks to the federal Labor government: that is because the Western Australian state government has been allocating more and more funds from the state budget. However, Western Australia cannot go on meeting the shortfall on its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, once our roads begin to get run down, a lot of related costs will blow out. Good roads provide economic development, employment, environmental protection and reduction in road trauma. If the roads fall into ruin then costs related to these areas will also be forced up. Road accidents already cost Western Australia $900 million per annum, despite improvements in road safety. And when so many Western Australian roads are in remote and desolate parts of the state, it is a major concern that the safety of outback road users may be compromised by a `couldn't care less' federal Labor government and its obstinacy and reluctance to come to the party in terms of providing Western Australia with its fair share of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very symptomatic of a government which is acting deliberately to penalise the people who live in states where there is a Liberal government by making it almost impossible for the state government to deliver the best infrastructure and services to the people. It is grossly unfair. It is a deliberate ploy by this federal government to cut off the water to Liberal state governments. While the Labor government goes about investing in its own future, looking after its young mates and its young turks in universities, in student guild offices all around the country, road users will continue to suffer as they see less and less of their money invested in roads. Unless we fix the roads, we will be in a very dangerous situation, very quickly. </PARA>

The Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise when it met in Sydney was advised by Air Services Australia that Simops, or cross-runway operations, `procedures are currently used on a regular basis at Adelaide, Darwin, Melbourne and Perth in accordance with established procedures'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made the point that Senator Vanstone is being ticky about when speaking to the point of order. There are a couple of points in this document that certainly do have grave concern for me. The first is the Lyons Forum suggestion that there are no child-care subsidies paid by this government to families where one parent is at home. That is an absolute outrage, because 25 per cent of child-care assistance dollars goes to families with one parent at home. Under the proposals that are now on hold in this place because the opposition prefers to oppose that legislation, we would have shared that child-care assistance to many more families with one parent at home. So you over there are proposing this document to dismantle it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document contains cold contradiction of John Howard's claims that he and the opposition would soften their hard right line. The document favours slashing the social wage. It would destroy the child-care system. It has very big cuts to welfare and regressive income splitting, and it is an attack on single mothers. In no way is this government prepared to endorse any of those points.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been known for some time that Defence plans to vacate Middle Head and North Head. These important areas are on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour. They are areas that retain a lot of their natural attraction because of Defence's long-term presence and management. Defence is currently looking at options for future use of the properties. In identifying those options, Defence has adopted a consultative approach, involving local and state governments as well as community representatives. A management study is already in place in Middle Head, and similar arrangements are about to commence at North Head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June of this year I met with the mayors of Mosman and Manly and also Mr Abbott. I outlined the government's approach and some commitments we were prepared to make at the outset. These included the preservation of the present bushland areas, to be incorporated in the Sydney Harbour National Park, and the protection of areas of national heritage significance. Whilst the mayors were obviously disappointed that Defence was leaving some of these areas, they were quite happy with the proposed arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention Mr Abbott was present at those meetings; therefore, he is fully aware of the government's intentions. Throughout the whole process, Mr Abbott has been given every chance to participate. He is a member of the steering committee oversighting the management study for Middle Head, and he is part of the process that he condemns. He therefore has absolutely no excuse for the misrepresentations that he has managed to put around on these issues in the last few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, on the Alan Jones program, Mr Abbott continued to spread that misinformation. He claims that Defence will get $25 million from property sales to pay for the relocation of 10 Terminal Regiment from Middle Head to Townsville. Of course, that is wrong. The money is already provided in the 1995-96 Defence budget. Whether we ever get any money from these two sites is irrelevant to the removal of 10 Terminal Regiment. I know Mr Abbott is unhappy about that, and I am inviting him to go to Townsville to explain to them that they should not relocate to Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress here in this chamber that Defence will not take an arrogant or a stupid attitude to any land disposals. If you look at our track record in Sydney, you will see that we always try to leave the community something behind. I will cite some examples. It was only earlier this year that we opened the Nirimba educational precinct, when navy moved out and left a magnificent community facility behind. And we did not screw the New South Wales Liberal government for money over this site, over and above what was a fair price. In the case of the now Labor government, we were able to negotiate a reasonable settlement to the Newington land to give the New South Wales government access for the Olympic site. Further, at areas like St Marys, this year we were able to remove the nuclear waste and free up 1,500 hectares for development to help house various people in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence, throughout all these processes, was committed to a consultative approach. Here we have Mr Abbott. I would not deny a junior woodchuck of the opposition a means to make his way in life&mdash;and he has made this his big issue&mdash;if only he would tell the truth about the subject. If only he would resist putting falsehoods around, on radio and through the local media, when he knows the true situation. He describes the consultative process as a sham. He is part of it. If he does not want to be part of a `sham', he should resign and let us get some of the more decent citizens of that particular area to participate in the consultative process and bring about a good result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no excuse for this sort of carpetbaggery that Mr Abbott is going on with. He knows the truth of this situation, yet he deliberately goes out there and distorts the situation. He has very much, I think, now aggrieved all the local councils in the area who know the true situation and who know that he is just endeavouring to support a bit of place seeking. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

To date, Western Australia has provided the result of analyses, but the Commonwealth has not had access to primary data. There is a significant amount of information that is yet to be provided by Western Australia, including the full breakdown of old growth by forest type and by different administrative reserves, as has been requested.

Was the minister aware of, and did this government support, the ABC's decision to ask the high price for their 24-hour pay TV news service which priced them out of the market? Is it not a fact that the present pay TV closed access regime which the government has allowed to develop will now lock the ABC out of the pay TV business?

<PARA>The question which this matter addresses is why was the third runway introduced in the first place. Was it introduced for the reasons which the government is now pretending&mdash;that is, it was unsafe? The answer is: no, it was not. It was introduced because we wanted to increase the efficiency and decrease the noise by increasing the number of take-offs and landings which went over the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was never any question. Indeed in 1991 you yourself said it can be run with perfect safety. You have repeated that today. You said at that time there was no parallel runway, therefore it can be operated with&mdash;let me quote you&mdash;`perfect safety'. There was never any question of that. Simops in that time can be used with `perfect safety', to quote your own words. It has been used for something like 40 years with perfect safety. There have been no accidents. There have been a couple of near misses but, if you look at the parallel runways around the world, how many near misses have there been? How many reports have we had of aircraft landing on and approaching the wrong runway?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister seemed to ignore completely most of the question which was addressed to him. That is why airports like La Guardia in New York, O'Hare in Chicago, Logan in Boston, LA, Frankfurt and Schiphol in Amsterdam are able to operate crossing runways. I would guess those six airports would be in the top 10 busiest airports around the world. Is he indicating that it is not possible? Is he indicating that those airports are running with `criminal negligence', to use his own words? Of course he is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excuse that the minister used was that there are parallel runways and cross-runways and the problem with Sydney is that we have two parallel runways and a cross-runway. Let me point out that in 1991 there was a cross-runway crossing only one of the runways. There was only one runway there. Now we have two runways parallel, but it still crosses only one runway.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that it is estimated&mdash;and this is straight from the statistics at Sydney airport&mdash;that, with the kinds of operations you are proposing, aircraft would be expected to cross the east-west runway every 45 seconds or less.

There is always a sequence of events that go wrong simultaneously. That is the common factor in all major aircraft disasters.

What, of course, has occurred is that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, has nobbled the inquiry. How that has come about is that, when the inquiry commenced taking its evidence, much of the material that was being presented to the inquiry related to the construction of the runway and the surrounding issues, including the environmental impact statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a Senate inquiry, chaired by Senator Parer. The Leader of the Opposition has said, `Let's re-open this runway.' In fact, he has taken steps within the other place to bring about that by his attempts to hold up other legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry, which has been going for some time&mdash;we have received over 6,000 submissions and are looking at very important issues; namely, safety of air travel&mdash;has been hijacked. The Leader of the Opposition has said: let's re-open the east-west runway. He has furthermore said: there is no need for an environmental impact statement into making that decision; let's just do it. Let us go back to what John Howard said in 1989, when he was supporting the construction of the third runway. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interests of safety, airport facilities should be upgraded immediately, including the construction of the third runway. The current congestion at the airport is causing increased noise pollution and becoming a serious threat, both to travellers and to local residents. The government is playing carelessly with a situation that could too easily result in a major tragedy. The risk must be averted.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what John Howard said in 1989. The problem then was twofold. Firstly, we had a lack of runway capacity at Sydney airport, given the fact that we were using cross-runway operations. Secondly, we had increasing demand for air traffic to get in and out of Sydney causing congestion and then in turn causing backlogs right through the system around Australia, and we all remember the delays that used to occur. That was then in turn causing great risk in terms of safety at Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have now? We have two parallel runways in operation and the movement capacity at Sydney airport is as high as it was at that time and will increase. We have had a reduction in the risk factor&mdash;one of the major reasons for the construction of the third runway. In other words, the risk has been averted&mdash;just what John Howard asked for then. The risk of an on-ground collision involving simultaneous operations has been averted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How has that been averted and achieved? By moving from what everybody has acknowledged was a safe operation, if all things went well, using simultaneous cross-runway operations to an even safer operation with parallel runways. I find it incredible that people, simply for base political motives, are prepared to stand up in public and say that, having improved air traffic safety, having improved the safety of air passengers in this country operating in and out of Mascot, they now want to reduce that safety. I think that is an atrocious approach to take to this issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Senator Crowley seems to take great delight in trying to demonise anything that is good and wholesome, such as the Lyons Forum. I indicate to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and the Senate that the Lyons Forum is named after Prime Minister Joseph Lyons and Dame Enid Lyons. Of course, Joseph Lyons saw the light and he deserted the Labor Party. I dare say that is why they do not like him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the vote of their fellow citizens, Joe Lyons reached the pinnacle of public life for men and Enid Lyons reached what so far had been the pinnacle for women in public life. Dame Enid Lyons, in her maiden speech to the parliament, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the motivation of all of us, including me, who are involved in the Lyons Forum. Indeed, the Lyons Forum, because of its concern for the family unit, engaged in a public inquiry right around Australia, canvassing evidence from all sorts of groups within the community. It heard from such luminaries as the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association of Victoria. Guess who represented that organisation? The newest mother in this Senate, Ms Jacinta Collins, as she was then&mdash;now Senator Jacinta Collins from the Labor Party. She thought it was good enough to appear in front of the Lyons Forum inquiry to give evidence on behalf of her membership. So the trade union movement thought it was okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, the minister did not read the report as she said she had. If she did read the report, she grossly misrepresented it. As my colleague Senator Campbell suggested to me, Senator Crowley is not required to produce maps to allow men to find their way around supermarkets; she needs a map to find her way to the truth. I will give a stark example of that. Senator Crowley suggested in media today that the Lyons Forum had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The welfare system itself encourages young women to have children as a means of providing themselves with income and somewhere to live.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a gross misrepresentation. It is untrue. There is no substance to that allegation. It is a quote in the document and it is footnoted as belonging to F. Walker, who wrote an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> on 21 August 1994. They are not the views of the Lyons Forum but an expression of some of the views within the community. A very harsh view was expressed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, but what did the Lyons Forum say? It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, the needs of single mothers&mdash;emotionally, socially, educationally, physically and spiritually&mdash;are often very great, and significant community support is required.</PARA>
<PARA>Why did she not tell the people of Australia that the Lyons Forum believes in providing significant community support for single mothers rather than quote somebody's assertions, which the Lyons Forum had put into its report simply to give a  flavour of the different views within society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the views as expressed in this report are shown in the executive summary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate, having regard to the abduction of Australian citizen, Mr James Peng, and the peculiar nature of his case, and concerned at his ill health, requests the Government of the People's Republic of China on compassionate grounds to grant the immediate repatriation of Mr Peng to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to speak long on this matter, as it has been agreed that it should be disposed of quickly. Today we heard that Mr Peng was sentenced to an 18-year gaol sentence in the People's Republic of China on charges of embezzlement. Mr Peng was abducted from Macao over two years ago and was held in detention without charge for some 13 months. He has since been held in detention for about 11 months, during which time his case went to the court three times. The court, on none of those three prior occasions, was willing to convict Mr Peng, although an order was made that he be held in detention until investigations could reveal an offence of which he could be convicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I was telephoned by Mr Peng's lawyers, who advised me that they understand that Mr Peng will have to serve 16 years&mdash;which is the 18 years less the two years already served&mdash;before he will be deported from the People's Republic of China. This motion is an extraordinary motion. I am aware of that. I thank honourable senators in the chamber for their indications of support for it. It is certainly a very peculiar motion, but it is based on the very peculiar case in question&mdash;the abduction and all of the circumstances surrounding the case. I think everyone is deeply disturbed at the severity of the sentence made against Mr Peng, especially after Mr Peng was abducted from Macao and given the prolonged time he spent in prison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the opportunity to thank Senator McMullan and other ministers of the government for the concern that they have shown for Mr Peng's wellbeing. I thank Minister McMullan for his several attempts to raise the matter with Chinese authorities. I can assure him that I appreciate this, as does Mr Peng's family. I also thank him for his courtesy today. I must say that Senator McMullan has been first-class in regard to this matter today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Peng has suffered health problems which are of concern to his family and to others. There are of concern to the Australian ambassador and to the Australian High Commission in Hong Kong. What concerns me in the whole context of this case is that a 16-year sentence not only would appear disproportionate but also could well amount to a life sentence in the circumstances. I believe that it is important that this motion pass. I would just say that the People's Republic of China can only go up in the estimation of the world if they show compassion for Mr Peng and if they agree to his immediate repatriation to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not the sort of motion that the Senate should carry as a matter of course&mdash;not because the Senate should not have serious concern about the circumstances of Australian citizens wherever they may be but because there are many Australians in circumstances which have some of the same characteristics as that of Mr Peng. It is not possible or appropriate for the Senate to carry a motion about all of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I shared Senator O'Chee's continuing concern for Mr James Peng, I did have to give some serious consideration to whether it was appropriate to have such a motion. I think there are sufficient special circumstances that have developed over the two years of this case and in terms of the manner in which it has been handled both publicly and privately by the Australian government and otherwise that indicate that perhaps on this occasion we should make an exception. I know this is cause of concern to at least one of my colleagues, and I respect his concern and his continuing active interest in this issue of Australians who are imprisoned overseas. It is properly a very important issue of human concern for all senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of the motion have been negotiated to recognise that this motion is a product of exceptional circumstances. We recognise that Australians, wherever they live or wherever they are being active in business or otherwise, are subject to the laws of the country in which they find themselves. Sometimes that leads to legal action which is not consistent with the standards which Australia would apply, but that is the circumstance which we all confront in participating in international activity. So there needs to be recognition of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that Mr Peng, an Australian citizen, appears on all the evidence to have been seized illegally in Macao and taken to China against his will. He has been held for a long time without trial. He has been held in circumstances that have caused us concern on many occasions. His health causes us concern. The circumstances of his wife and young children are a source of serious concern to those of us who know his wife and to those of us who are concerned about the circumstances in which she finds herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all those reasons and for some others to do with the nature of this case that are difficult for me to speak on in public, I am prepared in these circumstances to support the motion. But I was never in any doubt about the appropriateness of the purpose of the motion, which is to seek the immediate repatriation of Mr Peng to Australia. This is a matter which I have already raised with the Chinese authorities in China last week and which I will raise with them again. As soon as I finish speaking in this chamber, I will be speaking to the ambassador about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator O'Chee for his kind remarks. It has been a bipartisan issue, as it should be, and as the more general issue for concern for the welfare of Australians overseas is and should be. While recognising the very genuine and sincerely held alternative views of my colleague about the general principle, on this occasion it is a motion the subject of which merits all our support, but the procedure with which we are proceeding today should in these circumstances also warrant our support, although it is not something we should do lightly or repeat regularly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some concerns about this motion. I do not have any concerns about the sentiment of the motion; in fact, I have great sympathy for Mr Peng and his family. From what I have heard, if he was guilty of an offence, the sentence which has been given to him is out of all proportion. I realise that that is not uncommon in countries other than ours, because I am aware of some of the sentences that have been handed down to other Australians who are overseas. I stress that I do not have any concern about the general sentiments of the motion. What concerns me is that we are singling out one Australian who was incarcerated overseas to receive the support of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable senators may know that I have a great interest in the welfare of Australians held in prisons overseas. It is not something that I speak of publicly very often because I think the work that I do is work between me and the individual prisoner, and it is certainly not done for public recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently successful in having a prisoner released from a prison in Bangkok, where she had been for 10 years. When I say that I was successful, there were a lot of other people involved as well. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) gave a great deal of support and so did the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That particular constituent inquiry, if one might call it that, took eight years to conclude. It is probably the longest constituent inquiry I have ever had, but probably the inquiry with the most pleasing result in that the lady was released from prison and she is now back in Australia. Although it took me eight years, it never occurred to me to bring the matter to the Senate for its support. I worked with officials overseas, as I am sure the Australian government is working with officials overseas and the relevant people in the Chinese government as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present we have well over 100 Australians held in prisons overseas. Many of those could really come back to Australia on compassionate grounds. Earlier this year I visited two mens prisons in Bangkok and I spoke to two Australians there who are HIV positive. They were concerned that they were not even going to be considered for release or be sent back to Australia until they had AIDS. By that time, of course, they would really be coming back to Australia to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two men were brothers whose mother lives in Australia and has asked me to give what assistance I can. As I suggested, the earlier case took eight years and I did not think there was anything that could be done in the short term. This lady, who is getting on in years and looking after the son of one of the boys who is in prison, and other parents and friends who have sons, daughters or loved ones in prisons overseas could, if this motion is passed, as I presume it will be, probably think that they should petition the Senate to see whether they could have the same done for their loved ones. In the case of the prisoners I know, not only in Bangkok but in Indonesia and the United States, I do not think such a resolution would be the proper way in which to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of the few countries in the world which does not have legislation in place for the international transfer of prisoners. There is probably a historical reason for this. The Commonwealth of Australia can make treaties with overseas countries but the Commonwealth of Australia does not have any prisons in which to place people who might be brought back to Australia under an international transfer system. The states have all the prisons. It is probably because of this that we have not moved prior to this time for an international transfer process. But the international transfer process is the real answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that a great deal of progress has been made on this in Australia. The Commonwealth has agreed with all the states bar the Northern Territory&mdash;I am not sure about the Northern Territory&mdash;on legislation to be brought before this parliament and complementary legislation to be brought before the state parliaments so that we can have an international transfer system. There are a number of types of systems around the world, so I do not want to canvass what might be in the one that comes before this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the real answer for many of the prisoners I have met overseas, so that they can spend some of their prison term in the jurisdiction in which they were convicted and then spend the rest of their prison term back in Australia. There are probably good compassionate reasons for this. It means their friends and families can visit them more often, they are closer to them and, if there is any rehabilitation in the Australian prison system, they would be rehabilitated to come back into Australian society, where they would be sent after they finished their prison term overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my hope that legislation along these lines will be introduced before we rise for the summer recess. I am having negotiations with the relevant minister on this. It is not quite ready yet because there is still something that has to be done at the next meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to make sure that all the processes are in place. I am looking forward to the legislation's introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the motion that is before us. I have great sympathy for Mr Peng, his family, his health, the way in which he was brought to trial in China and the sentence that he was given. But for the reasons that I have outlined, I do have concerns with the motion. It is not a motion that one could vote against so I do not intend to do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madame Acting President, I welcome this opportunity to report to honourable Senators on the multi-party parliamentary delegation which the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs led to Europe in the first half of September. Senators will recall that the delegation comprised the Member for Chifley, the Member for Mayo, the Member for Moreton, the Right Honourable Member for New England, Senator Bourne and the Minister. The delegation visited eight countries in quick succession:  Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Austria. As you know, the Minister had to leave the delegation after the first week in order to attend the South Pacific Forum in PNG, and the Member for Chifley, the Hon Roger Price, who is chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade, led the delegation in his absence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This visit was a result of the upswelling of outrage among Australians at France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific. All Australians are appalled at the decision of President Chirac to ignore world opinion and to break the moratorium on testing introduced by his predecessor. This decision shows complete disregard for the feelings of those living in this region who are deeply concerned about the environmental impacts over the long term. Australians do not accept that these tests are either defensible or necessary. And in all sorts of ways the Australian people has given expression to its anger on this issue. We have sent delegations to France, we have sent protests, we have taken action in international forums and we have given the French government no comfort whatsoever on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What did this delegation set out to do?  Its main goal was to convey to the parliaments, governments and peoples of europe our determined opposition to nuclear testing. It wanted to encourage a more forthright stance on the part of France's European neighbours, as we know that the only way we will end nuclear testing is by building a unanimous international chorus of opposition to it&mdash;and the countries of Europe are particularly important in this regard. It wanted to lobby for a resolution in the United Nations condemning all nuclear testing. It also wanted to urge support for a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty which would ban all testing in all environments for all time. And finally, it wanted to explain the reasons for Australia's position, to make clear that our disagreement with France was confined to the single issue of nuclear testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here let me say that it is quite surprising to see some of the misinformation which has crept into the public mind in Europe on this issue. For example, the minister was asked by one interviewer why the Australian government was funding Greenpeace's activities!  It is a curious but unfortunate fact that from the distant vantage point of Europe it is easy to depict the Australian government as responsible for a variety of protest actions, some of which are illegal. The delegation was in Paris at the time of the riots in Papeete and it is certain that in the eyes of some there was the idea that the Australian government was somehow involved. Of course the government does not condone illegal protest activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to report, Madame Acting President, that the delegation achieved its principal objectives to a very substantial degree. The delegation had some 37 meetings with government ministers, parliamentary committees, other parliamentarians and relevant figures in bodies such as the European Union and International Atomic Energy Agency. The delegation held press conferences and gave media interviews in each country, to pursue our goal of raising public awareness of Australia's position. In addition the delegation took part in a video conference from Stockholm with the foreign relations committee of the Finnish parliament. The delegation also attended part of the opening of oral pleadings in New Zealand's action against French testing in the International Court of Justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The countries visited were very deliberately selected and in all but three countries, the delegation's interlocutors were very receptive to their representations, and discussions focused on ways in which we could work together to advance our shared objectives. In two countries&mdash;Germany and the United Kingdom&mdash;public opinion is running strongly against renewed testing, but for various reasons the response of governments has been disappointingly quiet. In these places the delegation was given a polite and attentive hearing but it was clear that there was a reluctance to take on board Australia's views, or for that matter the views of their own constituencies, on this issue. Nevertheless, it was pleasing to notice that after the delegations visits there, when the first test was held, both the German Foreign Minister and the leader of the British opposition issued statements which advanced their public positions on the issue:  and for that reason, and as a result of our continuing pressure, I believe the chance of further movement by these countries is considerable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visit to France of course fell into a category of its own. But even there the delegation was very pleased at the access it was to senior ministers. The delegation met the Minister of Defence, the Minister for Overseas Territories and the Minister for Aid. A meeting with the French Foreign Minister was scheduled but had to be cancelled because of an urgent international meeting on Bosnia which he had to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation's discussions were forthright and robust yet were held in a calm atmosphere. The French ministers explained the reasons for their government's decision. Delegation members for their part put to the French very clearly Australia's position on the issue. They went through one by one the reasons advanced by the French side, pointing out that the arguments in favour of testing were based on false premises. That is to say, arguments about reliability would make sense to a mathematician or a defence scientist, but in the real world no potential aggressor would stake his chances on the possibility that French nuclear missiles would not work. Given that 200 odd French tests so far have been successful, the chance that a first weapon used in anger would not go off is not one an aggressor would be likely to take. And if not the first, what about the second, or third?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegation members also attempted to explore further the possibility that france might obtain the data to construct computer simulation programs which it is looking for from other nuclear powers such as the united states. This is a matter mr bilney had raised on several occasions before, including before president chirac's election. I regret to say that the French authorities do not seem interested in the idea&mdash;for one reason or another it has not appealed to france.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegation took particular pains to explain to the French ministers that Australia was not attempting to deprive France of its nuclear capability. They reiterated Australia's opposition to testing being carried out by china as well as France. They took issue time and again with the view that Australia was opposed to France's place in the pacific or that the government was encouraging economic boycotts of French goods:  neither is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to say that these discussions did not yield the results the delegation might have wished. On the need for France to continue testing, it did not persuade its interlocutors to accept Australia's point of view. But I am sure that they now understand our position much better, even if they do not agree with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that an important part of the overall success of the delegation was the broad participation in it of all major parties represented in the parliament. I would like to pay tribute to the contributions of all delegation members, from the government, the opposition and the Australian democrats. The fact that all the major political parties in the parliament were represented helped reinforce the impact it made, by underlining the fact that opposition to nuclear testing is shared across the political spectrum in this country. It was particularly useful when meeting ministers and mps from the conservative side of politics, for example in the uk, that they should hear our messages conveyed by people who, on other issues, would normally be expected to share similar views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where do we go from here?  The campaign is by no means over. Another delegation from this parliament, led by the president of the senate, is currently in europe on a visit to the european parliament, spain and the oecd. This delegation will be raising the same issues as part of its agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is continuing to make its voice heard in international forums. Australia is actively involved in negotiations on a draft resolution for debate in the united nations general assembly which we hope will gain the widest possible support. This will be an important way of giving expression to the international community's condemnation of nuclear testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It now seems inevitable, though I say it with reluctance, that more tests will occur, but certainly not as many as we first thought. Nor is it clear to the government that any further bilateral action that Australia could take would make president chirac change his mind. I do believe, however, that the storm of opposition which has been aroused over this issue&mdash;and of which this delegation was part&mdash;has had a measurable impact in France. One has only to look at France's welcome acceptance of a zero-yield CTBT&mdash;as promoted by Australia&mdash;as well as the statement by President Chirac which clearly leaves open the possibility that the number of tests may be reduced. There are also indications that the duration of the test series will be shortened. I am optimistic that a sustained campaign of public opposition will reinforce this trend and that we will soon see a definitive end to nuclear testing in this part of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of this delegation to Europe. I was the only member of the Senate who was on this delegation. I would just like to make a few brief remarks about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a fascinating delegation to be on, not least because there was agreement between the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), Mr Roger Price, Mr Alexander Downer, Mr Ian Sinclair, Mr Garrie Gibson and myself&mdash;absolute, complete and utter agreement&mdash;that nuclear testing should be banned absolutely and for all time. I suspect this may be the only topic on the face of the earth to which we all subscribe and agree, especially considering some of our conversations on trains and planes and at dinner. But we were absolutely in agreement on this topic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our main goal, as Mr Bilney says in the statement just tabled by Senator Ray, was to convey to parliaments, governments and peoples of Europe our determined opposition to nuclear testing. I think we did that very well. We were able with different governments of different persuasions and different members of parliament of different persuasions to put a point of view that came from somebody who agreed with them on almost everything else but who did not agree with them on the topic of nuclear testing, particularly in the cases of the United Kingdom and, of course, of France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly disappointed by our visit to the United Kingdom. In almost every country we visited, including France, we were given very high level access to ministers and to foreign affairs committees, and very large numbers of the representatives of those committees turned up. In Belgium, I think 37 members of their committee turned up. In the Netherlands, most of the committee turned up. It was not as Senator Margetts mentioned to me before we left&mdash;and this does happen, I must admit&mdash;`You might have a couple of people turn up from the committee and that will be that.' It was not like that at all. We did have a lot of people come to the meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had high level access, except in the United Kingdom. We were all very disappointed by our access in the United Kingdom and by the reaction of the minister, whom we did meet. I must say that he gave us nearly an hour of his time, but that hour of his time was taken up with putting the French point of view, saying&mdash;and I hope I am not being unfair to him here; I do not think I am&mdash;that Britain's ultimate goal was for the French to sign the CTBT&mdash;of course, that is everyone's ultimate goal&mdash;and the way to do that would be to allow the French to carry out these tests and then that would be that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us agreed with that. Mr Downer, I thought, was particularly good in his statements to Mr Davies, particularly since he is on the same side on most things, as he pointed out to Mr Davies. But on this, he was not&mdash;none of us was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Britain we met the opposition; they were very good and put out a statement when we had left. In France, the ministers and the members of the conservative parties we met were not in favour of what we were saying&mdash;not surprisingly&mdash;but they were very polite about it and gave us a lot of time, gave us high access and were very decent about it. They did not agree with us. I do not think we convinced them, but then again they did not convince us at all either. Apart from those two places, everywhere else we went everybody we spoke to, except for perhaps a couple of people, absolutely agreed with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found some very interesting statistics as we went around. In France, more than 60 per cent of the population does not agree with the nuclear testing. In Germany and Belgium, 93 per cent to 95 per cent of the population does not agree with nuclear testing, and I would imagine that the percentages would be about that size in the other countries we went to. A recent poll showed that in Australia and New Zealand it is about the same&mdash;95 per cent of people disagree. We encountered a lot of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our goal was to put our point, our case, to try to get support and to try to make these people in Europe make known their support to the French. I think we did that to a large extent as well. We wanted to get support for our United Nations motion on this. I hope we did well in that&mdash;I think we did. We certainly appeared to when we were there. We wanted to put the points of view from our side which would counter what the French had been saying about us, particularly what Mr Chirac was saying about us in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Le Figaro</EMPHASIS> and what he was saying about us on television, which, as we all know, was just totally outrageous in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we countered that very well. In most countries we went to when we started trying to counter that we were told, `Don't bother. We don't believe it anyway. It's just silly.' So that was good. We were asked everywhere we went, `What is your main objection to this?' Our main objection to this is that it is a very bad signal for every other country on earth in regard to nuclear testing. That was our main objection. Mr Bilney put it a couple of times&mdash;and it is a good point&mdash;that there is absolutely no need for anybody to carry out one more test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who in their right mind, or even not in their right mind, is going to consider taking an action which will result in nuclear retaliation when the 200 tests that the French have carried out before now have been successful? Are they going to need another eight tests to worry about whether the next one will be successful? Of course they are not. If the next is not successful then the one after that or the one after that will be. The French obviously have a large enough stockpile for that not to worry them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That point was put many times and I think was accepted many times. We were asked almost everywhere we went about the environmental aspects of this. We gave copies of the report to the South Pacific environment ministers, which had been commissioned by Senator Faulkner, to many people in Europe. That was very useful, I must say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point about that report is that it is not a matter of: will the environment be degraded or will the nuclear waste material get into the water? Of course it will. There is no question about that. The question is: when will this happen? The answer to that is: it could be as soon as 50 years or it could be further into the future. It is most certainly contributing to the pollution of a marine environment. A marine environment is incredibly delicate. Letting off nuclear bombs in a marine environment is incredibly stupid. I think everybody we spoke to agreed with us on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the people I went with. It is a very motley group, I must say. You would not think we would all get on. Even though we did disagree on many topics apart from nuclear testing, we did all get on, which was a great comfort. I think the delegation went to eight countries in 10 days or something like that, so we were in each other's company on planes, trains and things like that a great deal. None of us was ever late, which was another major plus for a delegation like this. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to bring up any dissension in this report but I must say&mdash;and I feel very strongly about this&mdash;that I find the explanations that have been given to us by those who know all about nuclear test ban treaties as to why we should not worry about Australian uranium being used in French bombs to be very inadequate. The explanation given to us is that uranium is a fungible material. What a wonderful word `fungible'. It means that any handful of yellow cake, which is a hideous concept in itself, is absolutely interchangeable with any other handful of yellow cake. Therefore, the yellow cake that Australia sends to France is absolutely interchangeable with France's own yellow cake. Therefore, of course, Australian uranium can end up in French bombs. I find that a thoroughly unsatisfactory way to carry out any safeguards treaty. I hope we have learned a lesson from this and that next time treaties of this kind are negotiated we keep it in mind and do not accept the concept of a fungible material. </PARA>

It was also estimated that, over and above the $4.95 million contract, the department spent an additional $600,000 in administering the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each stage of that project involved gross mismanagement from the beginning, from the letting of a contract&mdash;a $5 million contract&mdash;which was done by selective tendering. I have to say that it was almost impossible for other than the company that got the contract to get it because of the way it was structured&mdash;and that should still be examined and that still has a lot of question marks hanging over it. The chairman of the ministerial committee at the time still has a lot of questions to answer about that and about how that contract was let. But once that company was selected, did anybody bother to do a Dunn and Bradstreet check on the company? No. It was balance sheet insolvent at the time it got that contract worth nearly $5 million. It went from bad to worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had to pursue each department. I had to go to the estimates committees and ask questions of DAS; I had to go to the estimates committees and ask questions of DEET; I had to go to the estimates committees and ask questions of Social Security; I had to go to the estimates committees and ask questions of Health&mdash;all because there was no single department responsible for that $5 million contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A staff member from OGIA at one point said to me, `Oh, Senator, we were just chairing the meeting. We didn't have a vote.' Two of the departments wanted to stop the contract, and one of them did not&mdash;and there is a whole cloud hanging over why one of them did not want to stop the contract, but there is another story in that. When I asked, `Well, why didn't you stop it?', they said, `Oh, we needed consensus, Senator. One of the departments didn't want to stop the contract.' So on they went down the path of disaster. When we really could not get satisfactory answers and it looked like there needed to be some really serious questions asked about the letting of this contract&mdash;about the contract itself, and about the fact that the company was given money before the contract was signed&mdash;every time I asked a question in estimates, more information came up that just showed it was an absolute bungle and total mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate then agreed to an inquiry, so the Community Affairs References Committee actually had an inquiry and made 33 recommendations about the letting of contracts and about this particular contract. Today the government has responded, in a way. We get the committee's recommendations listed, the government's response and some comments. Let me say that in the majority of cases, not all of them, the government has agreed with the recommendations. I suppose it was very difficult for the government not to agree with most of them because it was a majority report&mdash;it was a report that was agreed to by all the members of the committee on both sides of the house and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we see here some rather inadequate responses, and we see some areas where the government has actually learnt from this. One of the things the government has agreed to is that, if there is a contract which is let across departments, there should be a lead department. We should not have had to have a Senate committee to recommend to a government that has been in office for 13 years that when you have a contract at this level, especially for $5 million, you have to have a lead department. You have to have someone responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was asking questions, there was not one head of department who was totally responsible, and there was not one minister who was responsible. Everyone said, `Oh, that wasn't our responsibility, Minister.' Talk about passing the buck. It went on and on and on. Finally, after a committee inquiry into it, we have a recommendation that where there is a contract across departments we have a lead department. It does not take a genius to see that that is what is needed. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO "INQUIRY INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN LEARNING IN AUSTRALIA&mdash;PARTS 1 AND 2"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OVERVIEW</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Scope of the report</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 1 of the report was published in December 1994 and Part 2 was published in March 1995. The  Government response is a consolidated response to both parts of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 1 deals primarily with open learning in higher education and the roles of the Open Learning Agency of Australia (OLAA) and the Open Learning Technology Corporation (OLTC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 addresses other issues which were raised in the course of the Inquiry. These include the role of Distance Education Centres in providing open learning, issues of credit transfer, use of flexible delivery in the vocational education and training (VET) sector, student support, the professional development of teachers, future broadband services and the potential advantages offered by an information superhighway, the use of the Tanami Network and access to communications technologies by the adult and community education sector and people with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overall response to Part 1 of the report</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the Committee's overall positive response to the operation of the Open Learning Agency of Australia (OLAA), in particular, that the Committee considers that the OLA is making a valuable contribution to the provision of higher education in Australia by bringing increased flexibility to the higher education sector, promoting increased cooperation between institutions and stimulating critical evaluation of existing services to students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also supports the Committee's view that open learning is an approach, rather than a system or technique, which is based on the needs of individual learners which is moving the role of the teacher from a source of knowledge to a manager of learning and a facilitator. The Government agrees that this is an ideal that has yet to be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Open learning is an approach which facilitates access to learning which meets the learner's needs in terms of content, learning style and access. However, in many of its recommendations, the Committee separates open learning from the more encompassing issue of learner centred education. For example, the Committee's concern that the quality of open learning courses delivered through the OLA cannot be maintained under the present cost structure does not fully appreciate the convergence of these approaches in the provision of high quality education delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of explanation, the Government's Open Learning Initiative (OLI) seeks to capitalise on the Government's already significant funding for the provision of higher education by using existing courses and learning resources. Open learning course designers are expected to draw on the experience and knowledge gained from distance education and flexible delivery experiences to provide courses and materials that can be delivered as stand alone units, requiring minimal additional delivery support. Courses delivered through the OLA do not impose capital costs on provider universities as students do not attend lectures or tutorials as part of their study, nor do they impose costs on infrastructure support as students do not access many of the services and resources provided for on-campus and external students. Direct comparisons cannot be made between the costs of open learning provision and the costs of on-campus or off-campus study.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the OLI seeks to widen access to tertiary education by ensuring that open learning students are not financially disadvantaged by choosing this approach. Open learning students make a contribution to their education similar to that of other students undertaking undergraduate studies through more traditional approaches who attract a liability under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee discussed the pilot implementation of the Open Learning Electronic Support Service (OLESS). The Minister publicly launched the full rollout of the service, now called Open Net, on 19 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the Committee's view that the service must be accessible to remote and rural students and that fees for use should be equitable. To achieve these objectives, the Government has required Open Net to provide national local call access to the service, to provide access for both IBM, IBM compatible and Macintosh computers and to develop a national network of local access points using existing community facilities to permit access for those subscribers who do not have a computer or the appropriate communications software.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attention needs to be drawn to inaccuracies on the part of the Senate Committee concerning the trends in OLA enrolments, the costs of OLA courses and the obligations on members of the OLA consortium:  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">on page 66 of the report, the Committee expresses concern that the total number of registrants in OLA courses is falling when in fact they are increasing. The Committee has confused student registrations across all four study periods in 1993 with the student numbers for individual study periods in 1994. In the four study periods in 1993, 5125 students registered in 8906 study units. Over 9,000 students registered in over 22,200 study units in the four study periods in 1994. The pattern of registration has been similar in 1993 and 1994 with a gradual decline in student registrations for each study period as the year progresses. This is consistent with second semester enrolments of on-campus students;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">on page 45 of the report, the comments regarding costs of OLA courses for a student are misleading. The student course costs of open learning units are broadly equivalent to the costs of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). An undergraduate OLA unit is equivalent in credit to one eighth of a full time load at the provider university. Therefore, the OLA student can gain a full year's credit for study for a cost of $2,440. The equivalent student contribution for on-campus or external study through HECS is $2,355;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">on page 29, Mr Ken Widdowson, in evidence to the Committee, advised that OLA consortium members are not allowed to belong to PAGE. This is not correct. There is no prohibition on PAGE consortium members belonging to the OLA consortium or vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also supports the Committee's positive view of the initial work of the OLTC, but notes the Committee's concern that the commercial orientation of the OLTC might place at risk the aspect of public benefit implicit in the OLTC's services. Specifically the Government notes the Committee's concerns that the OLTC's services of public benefit are presently funded almost entirely from the recurrent contributions of public moneys from the Commonwealth and State/Territory members which could cease at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Commonwealth's funding of the OLTC has been to provide seed funding for the piloting of OLTC services which provide public benefit so that education and training sectors and State and Territory systems can experience these services and be informed of the costs and benefits of providing them. Examples include Commonwealth seed funding for the establishment of information services on open learning delivery and products and for the development of a framework for the implementation of broadband services for the education and training sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth expects that MCEETYA Ministers will consider the funding of a range of OLTC services with community benefit and develop and establish guidelines. More immediately, the development of the OLTC's role as the Governing Body of Education Network Australia (EdNA), described below, will require a review of its commercial and public good responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision to develop EdNA is a significant consideration which underpins the Government's response to many of the Committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EdNA will link all schools, TAFEs and universities and other education and training providers across the nation, as well as internationally through a service network and modern technology for interactive communication. EdNA will offer national coverage and provide full access to the Internet. It will offer secure communications and enable users such as schools to control access of individual users to particular categories of information. Initial services will include electronic mail, bulletin boards and real time chat sessions. Over time, the network will provide services such as interactive voice and video communication. The Government has approved funding of $1.5 million in 1995-96 and $500,000 each year in subsequent years to pilot the first stage of EdNA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MCEETYA ministers agreed in principle at their May 1995 meeting that the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments will collaborate in the establishment of a mechanism to manage and oversee, in broad terms, the use of EdNA and the provision of infrastructure necessary to receive EdNA services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overall response to Part 2 of the report </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the positive approach in Part 2 of the report in regard to the Committee's citation of successful open learning initiatives across all sectors of education and training and its enthusiastic support for the greater use of open learning approaches in education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also highlights the need for further change within educational institutions to initiate learner centred learning and notes impediments to its development caused by the barriers between education and training sectors. This is reflected in the report's recommendations to use national education and training forums and agencies to develop deliberate and co-ordinated policy to ensure a national shift to open learning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with recommendations contained in Part 1 of the report, recommendations in Part 2 tend to separate open learning from the more encompassing issue of learner centred education. By way of contrast, the DEET submission to the Inquiry states that issues of good practice teaching and learner centred learning are inseparable. Consequently, the Government's response to many of the recommendations assumes that learner centred strategies should be intrinsic to sectoral education and training practices. The Government does not support the Committee's statement that "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">nothing short of a major national effort to bring existing structures and policies into a coherent framework for open learning will enable us to manage the many dimensions of education and training which our social, cultural and economic aspirations logically require" </EMPHASIS>(page 74). This statement ignores the significant developments in open learning within and across sectors some of which are outlined below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government does support cross sectoral collaboration on the use of communications infrastructure and research into learner centred pedagogy which uses appropriate educational technologies and delivery methods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's approach is exemplified by its support of a range of initiatives some of which were documented in the DEET submission to the Inquiry, and some of which constitute new policy in the 1995-96 Budget. These initiatives are referred to under the various recommendations. These include the Open Learning Initiative and the development of Open Net services as part of this initiative and the proposed establishment of Education Network Australia (EdNA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On page 69, the report also discusses the need for collaboration and co-operation within and between systems in the development of curriculum and courseware. It notes that organisations can duplicate course development because of the lack of readily accessible information about what is being funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This need to avoid duplication of initiatives in open learning has been recognised and addressed to a significant extent by Commonwealth policy to date. In the higher education sector, for example, the assessment of proposals for the funding of development of resource materials, through programs such as the Committee for the Advancement of University Teaching and the National Priority (Reserve) Fund, seeks to ensure that projects do not duplicate work already being funded by the Department. The development of information services through EdNA should also serve to avoid duplication of initiatives including those supporting course development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS IN PART 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Open Learning Agency of Australia</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation No 1:  The Committee recommends that DEET fund OLA students at a level equivalent to 50 per cent of EFTSU to ensure the viability of the OLA initiative, to give OLA-enrolled students better quality student support and to ensure that equity considerations are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation. The OLA is an independent organisation, outside the National Unified System, established by the Government to broker open learning services on a fee for service basis. To ensure that equity considerations are met, the fee paid by OLA students has been set at a level broadly equivalent to HECS. OLA uses existing university courses and facilities and contracts with provider institutions to deliver these to OLA students. Institutions are required to ensure that courses and materials are delivered as stand alone units, requiring minimal additional delivery support. Criticisms of the current funding arrangements do not take into account the considerable Commonwealth funding already provided towards the development of these courses and the existing expertise in distance education and flexible delivery methodologies. Notwithstanding criticisms about the costs of open learning, the Government notes that the number of institutions ready to provide open learning subjects has increased in 1995 to 24 (including four TAFE institutions) and the number of units offered will increase in 1995 to over 220.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's concern that the current funding arrangements could lead to open learning units becoming second rate is misplaced. Study units and courses available through the OLA are subject to an institution's quality assurance mechanisms to ensure that units have parity of esteem with on-campus and off-campus offerings of that institution. Institutions must offer full credit for units offered through the OLA. In addition, all consortium members must allow full credit transfer for OLA units and consortium members are also represented on an academic advisory board which assures the quality of units offered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 2:  The Committee recommends that OLA be funded to provide a year round educational advisory service to prospective students. Such a service would include assistance with</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">selection of courses appropriate to each student's level of achievement, interest and need</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">understanding the requirements of universities with respect to their academic standards</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">proper utilisation of television programs as learning resources</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">planning an appropriate degree pathway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation and notes that it is already funding the OLA to provide this service. The OLA's Agreement with the Commonwealth states that the OLA will provide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">advisory services to assist participants to plan a coherent study sequence where desired leading to an award, and to provide on going information and clarification on degree options, units available, registration requirements, cross-crediting, certification, progression, course requirements and eligibility for graduation</EMPHASIS>. In addition the Agreement provides for the OLA to stipulate service standards for university providers which include course and study skills advice to be readily available by phone. Under these arrangements, a student is able to contact the appropriate person in the institution and discuss problems as they arise, as the Committee recommends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Optional tutorials are already available to students on a user-pays basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 3:  The Committee recommends that the Open Learning Tutorial Assistance Program (OLTA) operate under the auspices of the OLA from 1996 and that, once the OLA has that responsibility, it ensures that tutors have appropriate qualifications, training and support for their roles.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 4:  The Committee recommends that the rules governing the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme (OLDPS) be changed so that it operates on the same basis as the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). In particular, there should be no discrimination in access to OLDPS on the basis of study load.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme is currently being reviewed by DEET, in consultation with the OLA and the Australian Taxation Office, to assess whether the scheme is meeting its objectives. The review will also examine the eligibility rules and the efficiency of current administrative arrangements. The review is scheduled to be completed by the end of July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 5:  The Committee recommends that a special allocation be made to the University National Staff Development Fund for the purposes of training in instructional and courseware design, with such allocation targeted at academics involved in course design for open learning.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation. The Commonwealth Staff Development Fund (SDF) was set up to assist higher education staff development in the context of award restructuring. The main focus of the SDF to date has been on upgrading the academic qualifications of former Advanced Education College staff. Therefore, it would not be an appropriate funding source for the training proposed in the recommendation. Training of staff and academics in course design for open learning should not be separated from training of staff in courseware design for on-campus and off-campus courses, as open learning courses are derived from existing courseware. The Government is currently undertaking a review of the Fund. The Fund was established to run for six years from 1990 and a decision about its future should be made by late 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 6:  The Committee recommends that the Government enter into negotiations with the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) and Monash University for the restructuring of the OLA as a company owned by the AVCC and under the direction of a board established by the AVCC. Such an arrangement must be based on a commitment to the maintenance and further development of the OLA both nationally and internationally.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation. The Commonwealth has a legally binding agreement with the OLA which is a private company. The company already functions as a consortium of universities and the current providers represent some 50% of institutions in the unified national system. Other organisations can negotiate consortium membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Open Learning Technology Corporation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation No 7:  Through MCEETYA, the Commonwealth and States jointly fund the OLTC to undertake a benchmarking study of technology use in schools for the purpose of informing policy decisions on the utilisation of broadband services by the education and training sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The substance of this recommendation has already been met through initiatives supported by Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers. At the MCEETYA meeting in Alice Springs on November 4 1994, Ministers agreed that an investigation and analysis of education and training needs would be undertaken by the OLTC with regard to the future and proposed use of a broadband service network. It was also agreed that the OLTC would develop a collaborative framework for the implementation of broadband services for the education and training sectors for consideration by MCEETYA. DEET is funding this project. DEET has also funded the OLTC to survey all education and training sectors on their use of interactive multimedia and the Curriculum Corporation to survey the use of computing and communications equipment in schools as an initial step in the benchmarking exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 8:  The Committee recommends that MCEETYA establish guidelines for the OLTC regarding the public benefit dimension of its role and how this should relate to its commercial obligations to shareholders.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OLTC was set up as a small body to provide project management, information and brokerage services to the open learning community on a commercial fee-for-service basis and at discounted rates for Members, as part of membership subscription entitlements. Ministers agreed that core funding would cover services required by all members (ie Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers responsible for employment, education and training), as reflected in the feasibility study conducted in April 1991, and that services required by some users only would be provided on a user pays basis. The subscriptions were agreed at $795,000 a year at that time with the States/Territories contributing on the basis of the Australian Council on Educational Research formula (Commonwealth 50% and States/Territories proportional to populations). To some extent this reflects the limited knowledge of the roll-out and range of services to be offered by the OLTC at that time and the uncertain levels of client demand for services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since that decision the Commonwealth has provided funding to the OLTC to investigate and pilot services from which Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers can decide future levels of service required. All of these initiatives have potential public benefit. The initiatives funded by the Commonwealth were listed in the Commonwealth's submission to the Inquiry. Examples include consultancies and initiatives to investigate the potential for open learning services to assist people with a disability, to promote flexible delivery to small business, to facilitate change management in education and training systems in relation to the adoption of open learning technologies and to develop technical specifications to support education guidelines for interactive multi media for the use of education and training providers and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MCEETYA Ministers can currently fund the OLTC to provide services of community benefit within and across States and Territories. The OLTC will be reporting to MCEETYA Ministers on cost-benefit implications of its existing services and will provide advice on priority projects providing community benefit. If they wish, MCEETYA Ministers can then establish guidelines for the OLTC regarding the public benefit dimension of its role and provide funding accordingly. More immediately, the response notes that the review of the OLTC being undertaken as part of its proposed function as the Governing Body of EdNA, might also reconsider its commercial and public good responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 9:  That MCEETYA appoint to the OLTC board at least one person with qualifications in communications engineering or a related discipline, and that the OLTC acquire the skills of a qualified communications engineer, either on staff or on a consultancy basis.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation. Ministers agreed in August 1991, at the 67th AEC meeting the composition of the OLTC board in relation to types of expertise required. Ministers can change these requirements if desired. All Ministers have the opportunity of nominating board members, the list of nominations being voted on by all members. In determining membership of the board Ministers have not been constrained by requirements for specific expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes are being made to the OLTC board to achieve specific objectives of MCEETYA Ministers responding to the establishment of EdNA. In May 1995, Ministers agreed in principle, as part of the process of restructuring the OLTC to fulfil the role of the Governing Body of EdNA, that as a temporary measure, the board should be expanded to include additional experts from key sectors (two from the schools sector, two from the VET sector, two from the higher education sector and one from the Commonwealth), the schools and the VET experts being nominated by the Ministers responsible for those sectors and the higher education experts being nominated by the Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee and approved by Ministers out of session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than including communications expertise on the board, Ministers agreed that, in relation to this exercise, a Network Business Requirement Reference Group be established composed of representatives nominated by the Ministers responsible for the relevant sectors to assist the Commonwealth to define the network business requirement with the business requirement to be submitted to the Reference Group for clearance and to Ministers for approval by September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the recommendation that the OLTC engage the services of a qualified communications engineer, the OLTC has limited funds and has to date employed expertise on a project basis in line with current business practice . The OLTC has permanent staff with expertise in the application of communications technology to the educational environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 10:  The Committee recommends that in order to better inform policy making involving communications technologies, the Government requests the Australian Bureau of Statistics  to provide data, through its national household survey, on the ownership by households of communications technology and the corresponding patterns of usage.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation. In January this year the ABS published information collected in February 1994 on Household Use of Information Technology and is considering re-running the survey. The Government recognises the significance of the data for education and training policy. DEET will be responding to this initiative and will be considering the need for the purchase of questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 11:  The Committee recommends the appointment of a disabilities officer charged with ensuring  that the needs and interests of people with disabilities are, from the outset, factored into all advisory, design, project management, evaluation and service brokerage activities of the corporation.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation as it stands. However, DEET supports the direction of the recommendation to ensure that open learning initiatives are inclusive of people with a disability. In 1994, DEET funded a research project to explore the current situation and potential of open learning to meet the needs of people with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET implemented the findings of the above research by funding the OLTC to engage a consultant to undertake, edit and disseminate across all education and training sectors and the disabilities field the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Enabling Vision</EMPHASIS> and to organise a conference in February 1995. This conference brought together representatives of the disabilities field and experts in open learning to advise the OLTC on the development of services to improve access to education and training for people with disabilities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation.

This includes the use of technology and common educational goals in regard to life long learning and learner centred approaches to education delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned above, the Government sees open learning as inseparable from good learner centred practice. It believes, therefore, that learner centred strategies are intrinsic to good education and training practices within and between sectors.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Open Learning Initiative is a catalyst for the implementation of open learning approaches in the higher education sector, with increasing influence on the TAFE sector as this area of its service provision expands. The approach taken by the Government in requiring the Open Learning Agency of Australia (OLAA) to function as a consortium of universities has encouraged wider use of open learning approaches across the university sector in the development of stand alone course materials and the development of innovative modes of delivery, including broadcast television and radio, audio tapes and computer aided learning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the VET sector, the National Flexible Delivery Project Final Report of March 1995 has recommended the establishment of a National Flexible Delivery Committee responsible to the ANTA Board to address current identified impediments to the development of flexible delivery nationally. The development of open learning in the VET sector will be guided by this Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the schools sector, open access approaches based largely on the use of information technologies will increasingly offer students greater curriculum choice and better quality learning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed establishment of EdNA will enable delivery of educational services and products across education and training sectors and across the nation, and contain the costs of accessing interactive information networks for education users. It could also act as a focal point for the accessing of information services and databases identifying good pedagogy and efficiencies in the delivery of education and training through open learning. More details are provided in response to Recommendation 2 below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 2:  The Committee recommends that MCEETYA develop a joint Commonwealth-State funding proposal to establish by the year 2000, on a national basis and to a standard commensurate with broadband services and the convergence of technologies, a base level of telecommunications and computing infrastructure in all schools. This must be supported by adequate training for teachers and educational support staff. It is suggested that OLTC be asked to develop the draft proposal.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreement between MCEETYA Ministers to develop EdNA has to some extent met the intention of this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Developments in information technology offer unprecedented opportunities to improve the delivery of educational services in Australia. Australian Governments are in the process of making significant investment in the establishment of the necessary infrastructure to take advantage of these opportunities. However, it needs to be acknowledged that currently communications links are limited largely to standard low speed telephone lines which allow transmission of text and static graphics. It is important, therefore, to have mechanisms to ensure co-ordination as the technology develops towards a fully broadband and interactive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, the Commonwealth Government and the States and Territories have agreed on a major initiative, the establishment of a comprehensive education network service, EdNA, which will deliver educational services and products across the nation and contain the costs of accessing interactive information networks. The EdNA initiative forms part of the overall national strategy announced by the Prime Minister on 6 April 1995 to ensure that Australia is well placed to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the development of the so called `information super highway'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the meeting of MCEETYA held on 26 May 1995, Ministers agreed to a broad framework for the establishment of a national education network. In particular, Ministers agreed that such a network must offer Australia-wide coverage, avoiding discrimination on the basis of geographical location, and must be subject to an appropriate governance structure. Ministers also agreed to explore the advantages which could flow from a joint approach to the purchase of reception equipment (personal computers and associated infrastructure) necessary for educational institutions to take full advantage of information networking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific mechanisms have been approved to carry forward work on the key issues of negotiating the delivery of network services, setting up a Governing Body for EdNA and exploring the potential for joint purchasing of reception infrastructure. In the area of network services, it was agreed that the Commonwealth should be authorised to negotiate with telecommunications providers and with computer network providers to establish a national delivery system for education services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to undertake negotiations with potential suppliers, the Commonwealth needs to understand the needs and priorities of the users of a national education system. It has been agreed that, over the next three months, the Commonwealth should consult with all potential users of a national education network to determine as accurately as possible what products and services they need from an education network, including what kinds of functions they would want to see in a network service (for example, whether or not services such as control of individual access to particular subject matter groupings or secure communications between users are important to particular users).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will also be a need to address issues such as the level of telecommunications access (including bandwidth) required and the kinds of pricing structures considered necessary to make usage of an educational network feasible and attractive. At the same time, the Commonwealth will continue its investigation of the technical environment which will condition any response to the needs of potential users. The objective of the consultation process would be to develop a full definition of the overall `business requirement' of a national education network. This business requirement would form the basis for a public tender process which would invite the communications and computer service industry to indicate how it could deliver the services required by the users of a national education network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to ensure that this business requirement properly reflects the needs of educational systems, a reference group is to be established with representatives from the schools and VET sectors in all States and Territories and from the higher education sector. This reference group will be responsible for certifying that the description of the network business requirement developed by the Commonwealth properly reflects user needs. Ministers will also have an opportunity to examine the business requirement before a tender is developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of principles have been set out to guide the process of establishing a national network service. Key principles include the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The network must offer national coverage.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The network must, over time, provide a vehicle for convergence of current networking initiatives, including Open Net, AARNet and the Internet.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The network should service all sectors, school, vocational education and training (VET), further education and higher education.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The network should be fully accessible</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;individuals and institutional users should be able to access the network at affordable rates regardless of location.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;all mainstream reception infrastructure should be able to access the network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the process of developing the definition of a network business requirement will be completed by September 1995. The process of tendering for network services and evaluating tenders received would take place during the remainder of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of governance of EdNA, it has been agreed that a Governing Body should be established with the functions of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">managing the development of educational and technical standards for the delivery of services on EdNA by</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;setting guidelines on the kinds of material which could be carried on the network (for example, prohibition of pornography and setting general quality standards)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;establishing rules on carriage of commercial material;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;establishing guidelines for access by product providers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">encouraging the development of product and services, taking into account the above standards (product and services will include Commonwealth sponsored product, product from all education and training providers and systems and private sector product which meets technical and educational standards established);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring that the services provided constitute a comprehensive package which can be moved to an alternative platform, if required, without inconvenience to clients;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">defining, in consultation with the education sector, their functional requirements from any on-line service to ensure that their requirements are being met; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">communicating these user needs to the provider or providers of network services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governing Body of EdNA will be based on the OLTC. The Board of the OLTC will be commissioned to develop detailed proposals for changes to the structure and Articles of Association necessary to undertake the role of the Governing Body of EdNA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OLTC board will also undertake the task of drafting guidelines on issues such as access to the national education network, publication standards and carriage of commercial material. The OLTC will work with content providers to develop an initial suite of product and services to be offered on the network when it commences operation and will work on the development of an integrated directory structure. Initial services are expected to include a directory of education services and interactive message facilities. The processes of establishing governance arrangements for EdNA and developing content will take place over the next six months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of purchase of reception infrastructure, it has been agreed that an additional joint Commonwealth/State and Territory working party should be established to develop specifications for a combined tender for purchase of reception infrastructure. The working party is expected to complete its work by September 1995. It is expected that formal commencement of services of EdNA will occur early in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation also emphasises the need for adequate training of teachers to support the use of communications technology in schools. The Commonwealth does not determine the content of teacher training curricula. However, it anticipates that the EdNA will be used to support training for teachers and educational support staff and that current pre-service and in-service teacher training will take account of teacher needs associated with use of educational technology and multi media products. Currently DEET is funding the OLTC to develop a kit to support teacher training by demonstrating information and communications technology products and to provide case studies and examples of good practice and information on product applications and issues concerning compatibility of communications platforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 3:  The Committee recommends that the Government adopt the national strategy for broadband services proposed in the report, Networking Australia's Future, and endorses the recommendations of the Expert Group contained therein.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the broad policy direction of the Broadband Services Expert Group final report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Networking Australia's Future</EMPHASIS>. The importance of community access to the benefits of communications technology to support open learning is evidenced by the Government's commitment to initiatives such as Open Net, the Community Information Network and the proposed EdNA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will consider the specific recommendations contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Networking Australia's Future</EMPHASIS> during 1995 in the context of submissions from individual portfolios on information and communications services and technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In setting out its national strategy for creating a communications environment that will achieve desirable public objectives, the Broadband Services Experts' Group placed a strong emphasis on education. The development of Open Net as part of the Government's Open Learning Initiative has an important role in this strategy. It provides a communications service to link students and tutors and enables students to access educational resources and world wide information through the Internet. However, in addition to extending connectivity it will play an increasing role in the development of new features and services, enhancing interactivity, multimedia applications and the development of course content for electronic use. The Open Net service will ultimately converge with EdNA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 4:  The Committee recommends that the Tanami Network be developed and extended, in consultation with its community, to increase the number of sites linked into the network at a rate of at least four sites per annum.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends also that DEET continue funding of an on-site tutor for the tutorial support scheme at Yuendumu in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the second part of this Recommendation relating to the continued funding of on-site tutors at Yuendumu in the Northern Territory. DEET will continue to provide three tutors in support of the Yuendumu project and intends to use that support model as the basis for tutorial assistance in other remote communities. However, for reasons given below, the Government does not support the first part of this Recommendation which relates to the extension of the Tanami Network as it stands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Development and extension of the Tanami Network</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is looking at a wider range of available and effective educational technologies to enable a composite and more effective delivery structure rather than concentrating solely on the Tanami Network and the use of video conferencing in the manner recommended by the Committee. From the educational perspective, there is clearly much to be gained by matching delivery technology to educational requirements rather than trying to adapt only one technology to all circumstances. In this regard, contributions can be made by the Open Net service or through EdNA. The needs of remote communities and the capacity for education and training delivery through new technologies will be considered as part of the development of EdNA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that technology-based education and, in particular, interactive multi-media, constitutes a substantial tool in an integrated approach to development and delivery of teaching material and courseware to remote Aboriginal students and is well placed to add considerable value to the educative process in the near-to mid-term. However, technology is simply a vehicle through which appropriate and well-designed course materials are delivered to improve the learning environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Senate report identifies (pp 43-46), multi-media teaching methods provide positive educational outcomes only when a strong collaborative relationship exists between education technologists and planners, teachers, students and subject content specialists. By way of example, the effectiveness of technology-based teaching in the open learning trial at Yuendumu is, as the report identifies, limited by the absence of some of the collaborative support mechanisms mentioned above despite a substantial DEET commitment to Aboriginal education in the form of strategic and direct (tutorial) assistance funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tanami Network is an example of the usefulness of video-conferencing as one aspect of technology-based teaching applicable to delivery to remote areas. However, it is only one of many technological pathways to successful educational outcomes in remote classrooms. The various elements of the so-called "electronic classroom" and computer-based learning programs must be combined in an integrated way to allow effective education in remote schools. Importantly, integration also allows selection of the most cost-effective combination of available education systems which in turn can be better matched with, and able to support, a wider range of teaching materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, as part of their ongoing appraisal of initiatives put in place in support of access and participation goals (Goals 7 to 12 inclusive) of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy, the Northern Territory Department of Education evaluated the mixed-mode delivery of Years 8, 9 and 10 Mathematics and English in a number of remote schools using three different methods of communications technology delivery. These methods included two-way interactive video-conferencing using the Tanami Network, electronic classroom/bulletin board service/electronic mail (an interactive pc/modem-based audio-graphics system) and computer assisted learning packages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appraisal found in all three cases that technologies were easy to operate and that learning occurred at a faster rate than using traditional correspondence methods. However, there was universal agreement on the part of participating teachers that even the most effective delivery technology will not assist in obtaining positive educational outcomes where deficiencies exist in the teaching materials available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tanami Network has been successful in delivering training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders at the CES network level, specifically to remote clients. However, this limited use does not by itself justify further expansion of the Network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Costs and Benefits</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cost effectiveness issues were also dealt with in the Northern Territory evaluation which found a significant on-cost differential between Tanami and electronic classroom operations. Given that similar increases in learning rates appear to be experienced by students in both systems in identical subjects, the matter of unit costs must be objectively assessed in order to maximise delivery of an effective service to as many remote students as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to inform prospective users of the costs and benefits of the use of the Tanami Network, the Department of Employment, Education and Training commissioned two consultancies; the first one investigating the potential of interactive video-conferencing to improve the delivery of Government services to remote communities; and the second to investigate the potential for establishing a national remote area video conferencing network. The report of the first consultancy has been made available to Government Departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Key elements of the findings of the second consultancy were incorporated by the Tanami Network in its submission to Social Justice Commissioners and their proposal for a national network forms part of Recommendation 97 contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recognition, Rights &amp; Reform </EMPHASIS>, the ATSIC Report to Government of Native Title Social Justice Measures, presented in March this year. The Government is currently considering a response to this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of MCEETYA, the OLTC is also currently undertaking an investigation and analysis of the education and training needs of both existing and proposed broadband services. As part of this project, the OLTC is developing a collaborative framework for the implementation of broadband services for the education and training sectors. The potential of the Tanami Network to deliver cost effective Government services will be considered in the wider context of this investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 5:  The Committee recommends that all ANTA agreements with the States and Territories require an explicit commitment to the development of flexible delivery systems in the TAFE and private training sector and that performance indicators for the training effort of States and Territories reflect that commitment.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation. One of the themes of ANTA's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS> document is greater responsiveness to client needs. It addresses the need for flexible training initiatives, with particular reference to supervisors, small business employees, people with literacy and numeracy needs, people who are geographically isolated and people requiring preparatory and pre-vocational courses in various settings. The report also sees flexible delivery as having the potential to address the needs of women and of people with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, as mentioned in the response to Recommendation 1 above, The National Flexible Delivery Project Final Report of March 1995 has recommended the establishment of a National Flexible Delivery Committee responsible to the ANTA Board to address impediments to the development of flexible delivery nationally in the VET sector. The development of open learning in the VET sector will be guided by this Committee. In addition, the Government will be looking to ANTA to reflect a commitment to flexible delivery in the guidelines for the development of State Training Profiles and for States to report on the achievement of nationally agreed strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 6:  The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth undertake a review of the funding of student financial support with a view to equitably accommodating the wide range of study patterns now available to students.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation for reasons given below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Employment, Education and Training monitors education delivery initiatives and examines the possible impact of such initiatives on students' access to assistance. The aim is to provide assistance to all eligible students on an equitable basis, regardless of how the education is delivered to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report argues that traditional notions of determining students' eligibility for student assistance no longer apply with the expansion of the number of students accessing the open learning approach to study.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While recognising the flexibility available to students through `open learning', it is crucial to keep in mind that the primary purpose of the student assistance schemes is to provide income support to full-time students. Those who are essentially part-time students have greater opportunities to support their own education costs through employment, rather than having to depend on public support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Practices are in place that recognise the flexible study patterns available to students who study under open learning-type arrangements. However, the need for students to study full-time remains. While students have the flexibility under open learning arrangements to structure their own study patterns, it is expected that institutions will continue to monitor the students' enrolment and academic progress. Given this, it has been accepted that institutions themselves are best placed to determine the workload that students undertake over a period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with the primary aim of student assistance, the Government expects that students seeking income support will be formally enrolled full-time by their institution, and undertake a workload that is accepted by the institution as full-time (whether a term, semester or other period), taking account of the highs and lows of attendance patterns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised the issue of home-based secondary study, particularly for remote area students. Assistance is not denied home-based students simply because they study from home. On the contrary, it has been long standing policy to provide assistance to students studying by correspondence. For example, AUSTUDY allowances are available to correspondence students on the same basis as for students who attend a school or other institution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A respondent put to the Committee a concern that secondary students wishing to study in an open learning mode risk losing their AUSTUDY payments. An example was given where barriers to receiving AUSTUDY were presented to students electing to attend Cyril Jackson Senior High School for reduced hours in a week ("less than the prescribed 16 hours").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the introduction of AUSTUDY, the determination of whether or not a secondary school student was studying full-time has been left to the school to decide. Where a school considers a student to be studying full-time, this is accepted by AUSTUDY. There is no additional legislative or administrative requirement for students to attend school for a minimum number of hours each week. This means that students attending a secondary school for reduced hours because the school allows for an open learning approach to study can continue to receive assistance as long as the school continues to view the student as full-time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the focus of this recommendation is on student financial support and student assistance programs, the report also discusses the need to address the funding implications of a change from traditional face to face teaching costs to the high up front costs of developing learning materials for open learning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the higher education sector, a recent study commissioned by the Higher Education Council examined issues, including the higher costs of developing materials for distance and open learning compared to on-campus course development. The study proposed that the distinction between traditional on-campus provision and distance or open learning provision was no longer useful. It suggested that all modes of education and training delivery now used resource based learning with consequent changes to the cost structures of course development not only for open learning but for all study patterns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this fundamental change in teaching and learning towards resource based learning, there are cost-efficiencies to be gained from open learning approaches. For example, in the higher education sector, a number of universities have expressed interest in using open learning subjects and courses developed through the OLAA for on-campus students. The university would provide access to additional student resources, such as tutorial support and library. This proposed use of already developed materials would add cost efficiencies for both the OLAA and for the university. DEET has indicated in-principle agreement to this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 7:  The Committee recommends that OLTC, in consultation with ACTRAC and other relevant agencies, provide advice to MCEETYA on the funding, co-ordination and marketing of courseware developed for use within the Australian vocational education and training sector.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not support this recommendation. There are already a number of  commercial operations marketing courseware in the VET sector, not only at State and Territory levels but at the national level through the establishment of ACTRAC Products Pty Ltd, a company limited by guarantee operating under the auspices of ANTA. At the 25 May 1995 Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) Ministerial Council (MINCO) meeting, it was agreed that a Memorandum of Understanding be entered into to link ACTRAC Products Pty Ltd operations with the policies of ANTA and the Ministerial Council and to confer on the company the broader function of marketing the new ANTA Standards and Curriculum Council. The MINCO agreed that the new Council will come into operation from 1 July 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation. The Commonwealth commissioned the OLTC to organise a national conference <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enabling Vision `95; Creating Equity in Education through Open Learning</EMPHASIS> in February 1995 to consider, among other things, the potential for open learning to improve education and training delivery to the disability sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OLTC will be reporting to ministers for education and training on outcomes of the conference for open learning strategies to support the disability community. It is anticipated that an important element of the proposed strategy will be the development of guidelines for courseware design which take account of the needs of learners with a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 9:  The Committee recommends that the National Open Learning Policy Unit of DEET in consultation with the relevant unions and employer associations prepare a Discussion Paper for presentation to MCEETYA on the impact of open learning approaches on the terms and conditions of teachers.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation but recognises that the negotiation of terms and conditions of teachers is not the responsibility of the Commonwealth. However, the Government supports the intention that MCEETYA be informed of the opportunities for teachers in the use of open learning approaches and technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Projects have been initiated to consider these issues. These include Commonwealth commissioned research and that undertaken by NBEET.

Such use would most likely be on a user pays basis, because schools budgets are unlikely to be able to subsidise additional use of school buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also recognises that primary responsibility for the School, Vocational Education and ACE sectors rests with State and Territory governments. However, the Government will propose to MCEETYA that it reconsider the need for the development of community access guidelines (and associated code of practice) for State and Territory schools and VET institutions as part of its National Policy on ACE, in light of the potential for wider community access offered by EdNA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation No 11:  The Committee recommends that ANTA, in consultation with the State training authorities, develop guidelines for the registration of private training providers requiring them, as part of their compliance with regulations concerning the standards of facilities, to provide their students with access to infrastructure resources commensurate with the level of training undertaken.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Application form templates for the Registration of Training Providers have been developed by State and Territory recognition authorities and agreed by MINCO. These incorporate details of facilities of private training providers.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the move to learner centred and resource based learning, it is increasingly important that providers are able to demonstrate access to relevant communications infrastructure and student support systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is particularly apparent in the consideration of tenders for the delivery of formal training based labour market programs (LMPs) which are delivered by public, private and community organisations, all of which have different infrastructures and varying capacities to offer flexible delivery methods including open learning.

<PARA>It is important and relevant during this week, when the Cattle Council of Australia has issued a major industry statement, for us to look at the beef cattle industry and the enormous contribution that industry has made to Australia and its economy ever since Australia was first settled by Europeans. As my motion says, the Senate should take note of that contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also acknowledge that at present this industry, after such a major contribution to Australia, is in its worst crisis in 10 years. It is also relevant in this debate to look at the inaction of the current government in addressing some of the problems which confront the beef cattle industry and perhaps the reasons why, after 13 years in office, these problems have not been addressed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beef cattle industry is a very significant industry, particularly in my part of Australia, in Queensland. The industry remains the engine room for much of the growth in rural Australia with a total value of farm output of $4.4 billion in 1993-94, which makes it easily the largest single rural contributor. It accounts for 19 per cent of the value of rural output in Australia. The total value to the economy of the beef industry, including the off-farm sectors, is estimated to be $7.7 billion. It provides employment for an estimated 120,000 workers directly, and 600,000 workers indirectly; that is, counting those off-farm. So it is a major employer of labour within our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beef industry generates sales and employment for the myriad import suppliers&mdash;from banking services to fertilisers, fences, machinery, chemical companies and the like&mdash;located in every Australian rural town. The industry is a major and growing contributor to Australia's export earnings with a $3.3 billion return from 1993-94, or 17 per cent of the total agricultural export value. This makes the beef industry Australia's second largest rural export earner, only slightly behind wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cattle industry is central to the viability of many rural towns, particularly in remote areas of Australia. Its decentralised nature provides national and social benefits even beyond its sheer size due to the impact on the utilisation of state and national infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a major contributor to Australia&mdash;to the economy of Australia and to Australia's wealth over very many years. I hope the Senate will adopt my motion in noting that enormous contribution the industry has made. The industry, of course, consists of all of those people: graziers, pastoralists, the workers in the processing factories, the transport people, the exporters. All of those many people contribute to what is and has been for many years one of Australia's great industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now in a situation where the industry is in crisis. It is hit by drought. Of course, there is not much anyone can do about that except try to facilitate policies which will encourage graziers to droughtproof their properties in the good times&mdash;for example, taxation regimes which will allow graziers and pastoralists to put aside a little bit of money in the good years so they can carry on through the bad years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other reasons the cattle industry is in crisis. Some of those are matters which can be addressed by the Australian government. We have had a series of questions this week on the crisis in the beef cattle industry and the government's possible solutions for that crisis and we have heard nothing from Senator Collins. The minister for primary industry has filibustered his way through his four minutes to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins keeps telling us that we have not read the Booz-Allen report, and no doubt we will get another serve on that. He keeps telling us that the meat processing costs in Australia include a transport component. That is what he was trying to tell us on Monday. That is how much he knows about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect&mdash;and it seems pretty obvious&mdash;that the minister for primary industries himself has not read the Booz-Allen report, as I and many of my colleagues have&mdash;colleagues on this side who will be speaking in the debate and who are very interested in these industry reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to concentrate on those elements of the difficulties in which the beef cattle industry at the moment finds itself which can be addressed by government. As I say, I acknowledge that there are certain factors we cannot influence. But those that we can influence we should be influencing. I think the Senate should condemn the government for its lack of action in attacking those things that we are able to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for the difficulties and the poor returns being experienced by the industry lie in policies which have discouraged community saving and which have maintained high real interest rates. The reasons also include the high taxation rate which is applied to export industries, and the failure of other sectors of the Australian economy&mdash;such as the processing, transport handling and government services&mdash;to match the productivity which is evident on farm and in competing Pacific Basin countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our industry depends critically on improving trade access and matching or exceeding productivity improvements overseas, particularly those productivity improvements which we have seen recently in New Zealand and in the United States. Whilst the productivity of those countries has increased, our productivity in Australia has gone backwards. While it can be clearly demonstrated that Australian producers have maintained the edge `on-farm', the rate of reform and efficiency progress in the processing, transport and handling, and service industries is very low when compared with world's best practice or to the continued improvements being made in those major competitor countries, particularly New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's meat processing sector is internationally uncompetitive. Part of the cost component in that sector is made up of the highly restricted and archaic industrial practices and the high labour costs, in addition to the high costs of government inspection services and taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour productivity, expressed as cattle processed per employee per day, was 1.4 in Australia compared with 2.9 in the USA and 3.4 in New Zealand's best. The award coverage and the tally system of payment has led to gross under-utilisation of physical capital resources within Australia. The Fellows Medlock and Associates review of progress in workplace reform in the export meat processing sector indicates that workplace reform in the meat processing sector over recent years has been&mdash;and I quote their word&mdash;`limited'. They are some of the issues that Australia must address to make the industry more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Road transport in Australia is relatively efficient. The beef cattle industry relies very heavily on road transport within Australia. However, although the transport industry itself is efficient, it is heavily burdened by taxes imposed by this government&mdash;taxes which have increased dramatically over the Labor Party's term in charge of the treasury bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, efficiency on the waterfront and in shipping remains well short of international best practice. It is a regret that the current minister for primary industries is the same minister who was given the job of fixing up the waterfront. He promised that he would resign if he could not get productivity up, if he did not fix the problems in the waterfront industry. But we now find that the Bureau of Industry Economics has reported that stevedoring productivity has reverted to 1991 levels&mdash;levels which were in force prior to the costly Waterfront Industry Reform Authority process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leaves Australia's best performing container terminals equal to the worst in Europe. So the best in Australia is equal to the worst in Europe. Australian crane rates are 25 to 50 per cent behind the world's best practice. The Bureau of Industry Economics concluded that, in regard to container productivity, most overseas ports have moved ahead whilst in Australia we have gone backwards. Unfortunately, waterfront reform was the job the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was given a couple of years back. He failed at that. It is now pretty obvious why he is failing at addressing the real problems affecting the beef cattle industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation regime in Australia at the present time has beef production burdened by the existing emphasis on indirect taxation. Sales tax, excises, bank transaction taxes, payroll taxes, stamp duties, licensing charges and land rates all fall most heavily on business inputs and directly affect the wealth and health of the beef cattle industry. Indirect taxation costs the farming community $1 billion per annum. Beef producers, being reliant on export markets, are unable to pass these taxes on in their price to final consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excise on fuel used in road transportation of fodder, grain and other inputs and in the movement of livestock also has a major impact on the cattle industry. Much of the industry is in the northern areas of Australia, in fairly remote and far distant areas, and that fuel excise has a substantial impact on the industry's profitability and international competitiveness. Federal tax imposts through sales tax, tariffs and payroll tax also provide a major cost burden to the beef producers, both directly and indirectly, in the price of farm inputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So those are the things which should be addressed by the government. But this government, after 13 years in office, has failed miserably. That is why the cost of processing meat in Australia is 113c per kilo, in New Zealand it is 72c and in the United States it is about 40c per kilo. There can be only limited explanations as to why this government has not had the courage to confront those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies adopted by government with regard to industrial relations, taxation and the provision of government services need to be looked at very closely. The policies of this government are acting to stifle the performance of the Australian beef industry. Industrial laws must be altered to allow employees to freely enter into agreements with their employers, without the intervention from outside bodies such as national and state based unions. Because Senator Sherry and most of the other Labor Party members here are straight out of the union movement, there will probably be a long period spent in this debate in defence of the role unions have played. But it is fairly obvious that in this industry in particular the unions have been a real impediment to its efficiency and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cattle Council has urged that all taxes on business inputs&mdash;particularly those on fuel, payroll, sales tax and tariffs&mdash;be addressed as a matter of urgency. The government must also look at meat inspection charges and it must seriously consider the funding for research and development in this particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this week, in which the Cattle Council of Australia has released a major statement on the industry, it is important the Senate pauses to recognise the enormous contribution the industry has made to Australia over the years, to recognise that the industry is in real crisis at this particular time and to condemn the government for its lack of action after 13 years on anything which might assist the beef cattle industry to overcome its current competitive disadvantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to address some of the matters put forward by Senator Ian Macdonald and some of the questions that have been raised in the chamber this week. In terms of this industry, there is one fundamental question that I believe needs to be answered by the coalition&mdash;the Nationals and the Liberals. Senator Macdonald and Senator Boswell have raised issues in this regard this week. I ask this simple question: why is it that the coalition hates meatworkers so much? That is an answer that meatworkers in this country are entitled to get. The 50,000 meatworkers in this country are very interested in the answer to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell says that many of them are National Party members, but the National Party does not serve their interests. You come in here and your main issue is to cut the wages and conditions of working people in this country. That is the essence of your policies which attempt to deal with the so-called rural crisis in this country. We get no indication that you understand the nature of the work in this industry; we get no indication of its heavy physical nature; we get no indication of the dangers involved in this industry; we get no indication that the meat industry is the second most dangerous in the whole economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to international standards, we are the second most dangerous country in terms of meatworker injury rates per 100 employees. In the Booz-Allen and Hamilton report there is a reference to that fact. It reports that Australia comes second to New Zealand&mdash;the great workers' panacea that you constantly cite. The survey contained in the report indicates that in New Zealand there are some 210 injuries per 100 workers compared with some 130 injuries per 100 workers in Australia. They are both absolutely appalling statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community at large has to understand that there is a constant risk of injury. The payments in the industry are so unreliable. Work is performed at such a high speed and suits producers. It is seasonal in its nature and essentially it is founded upon gross insecurity. Obviously, within the industry itself there are very large numbers of awards and agreements which lead to different rates of pay and conditions for workers that are performing the same task. What do we hear from those opposite? All we hear is that the crisis that has occurred in the meat industry is because workers earn too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland a number of abattoirs have closed down. That is testament to the sorts of industrial policies that we are likely to see under a coalition government in many respects. The very large American producer that owns those meat works is essentially seeking to secure wage cuts and productivity increases. That is at the core of that industrial dispute in Queensland. Conagra, an American firm, is essentially trying to apply American conditions, American styles of work and American work practices to Australia. That is a situation which will inevitably lead to crisis within the industry. What we see is a proposition whereby there is a direct attack on workers' wages and there is an attempt to remove penalty rates, to produce a 10-hour day, to have continual working operations within any particular plant, to move to bigger production runs and to produce a set of circumstances whereby the company seeks to crush the union and crush workers within this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a union point of view, there is quite ample evidence to suggest a willingness to talk and to seek an enterprise agreement approach. Do we see a response from the employers in Queensland? That is at the core of the industrial dispute in Queensland. I understand that a number of meatworks have closed down because of a claimed shortage of stock. There may also be an element of a lock-out involved in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be understood that if we are looking at the question of the costs of production in this country, the Booz-Allen report has quite clearly indicated that workers' wages are only a very small component of production. I understand that it might be as little as only 10 or 12 per cent of production costs. The major cost of production in this country is the cost of the product itself: the cost of stock. This report says that there are a whole range of factors involved. As Senator Collins has clearly pointed out to the Senate, up to 60 to 70 per cent of the costs of production are related to matters that are directly outside the control of the industry itself in this country. Page 2 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We estimate that were the Australian "Best-in-Class" to be lifted intact (with existing equipment, management and workforce) and dropped in an Iowa cornfield, 60% to 70% of the performance gap would disappear.</PARA>
<PARA>If we look at the issues relating to the costs of production, we see that there are a whole range of factors which we never hear anything about from the coalition. We do not hear anything about the fact that Australia produces smaller, leaner animals. We do not hear anything about the less reliable animal supply. We do not hear anything about the distance from markets. We do not hear anything about the whole range of other factors involved in terms of overheads and in terms of the packaging and fabrication that is involved in this industry. When we talk about inefficiencies in this industry, we have to make sure that we get a balanced approach, something that we do not see from the coalition. The reason is very simple: essentially, your hatred for workers comes shining through on every occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the issue of unit costs, we have to take into account a whole range of other factors. This report talks about matters such as the exchange rate. Since the preparation of this report, it says that exchange rates for the 1991-92 season have made a tremendous difference in cost position. The drop in the Australian dollar since the original study could have eliminated 10c per kilogram of the processing performance gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the situation in other parts of the country&mdash;which again we never hear anything about; all we hear anything about is how dreadful meatworkers are&mdash;in Victoria, as I understand the situation, there are 26 enterprise agreements registered with the commission and there are 12 more ready to go. They cover the vast majority of meatworkers in Victoria; some 75 per cent of meatworkers are now covered by industry agreements. The smallgoods producers are now involved and enterprise agreements are moving right across the industry, including the major export works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a remarkable transformation of that industry without cuts in workers' wages. This is the core of the difference between Labor and Liberal on this issue. Our intention is to maintain living standards. Our intention is to ensure that workers have a proper place in this country and that they are treated as full citizens so that the whole gamut of social wage conditions are protected, as well as their take-home pay. If we look at Victoria, we see that many employers are quite prepared to acknowledge that there have been substantial changes. For instance, the Fellows Medlock report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">one company cites an 86 per cent improvement in output per employee over the period since their agreement was signed and gives the credit for this change almost solely to the impact of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>Another chief executive cites:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our agreement provided the base to change our culture. This itself has led to a quantifiable 16-17% increase in productivity. The union has been no barrier to change and our next agreement will continue this process&mdash;we want to look at expanding plant utilisation through flexibility in hours.</PARA>
<PARA>This will be achieved without cuts in wages. There has been a 25 per cent increase in wages in Victoria and a substantial improvement in productivity. That contrasts dramatically with your attitude, which essentially is geared to the proposition that you hate working people. You cannot possibly cope with the proposition that working people should get a fair say in the running of enterprises and a fair return for the production in enterprises. Your approach is flexibility, but flexibility downwards. Your intention is to undermine the conditions of working people in this country. In that way, of course, you quite sharply distinguish yourselves from us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just not good enough for you to come in here and say that the so-called crisis in the meat industry can be put down to the working people in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I told you it wouldn't be a point of order. I am genuinely interested to hear that after two weeks John Anderson made a statement somewhere yesterday. But to the best of my utilisation of the parliamentary database, it was not in the parliament. This is the chamber of debate, Senator Boswell, as you have correctly said on many occasions. This is a house of debate. The parliament has been sitting for two straight weeks. You describe this as the worst crisis currently facing primary producers and your shadow minister, to the best of my knowledge, has said nothing in the Australian parliament about it. Nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza has said by way of interjection that, should a coalition government win the next election, John Anderson will be the next minister for primary industries. I tell you what: if you win government, he will have to perform a bit better than he is currently doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can you take this motion seriously when the shadow minister himself has paid scant regard to the issue. I have to say it is news to me that he has made any statement about it, but I will accept Senator Boswell's word that it was made yesterday. Isn't it terrific that after a fortnight of parliament sitting, somewhere or other he made a statement about this major crisis yesterday&mdash;John Anderson! We have a so-called crisis in the beef industry and not a word has been said about it in parliament by the relevant frontbench member of the opposition. I will give credit to Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Boswell for at least raising the issue here in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current serious problem in respect of beef abattoirs in Queensland is something that we do regard very seriously indeed. As I have told the parliament, there is a great deal of room to improve in terms of the work practices that are being conducted in some meatworks around Australia, but a great deal of work is being done to improve it. Opposition senators, who are fond of quoting the Booz-Allen report into why there is lack of competition in the Australian beef industry, should at least be honest enough to give all of the reasons that Booz-Allen determined were the reasons for that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the Booz-Allen comments on problems in processing and better work practices, there is no question that they saw that as being a significant component of the 30 per cent of that non-competitive gap that can be addressed by the industry. But they rated as big a problem, in percentage terms, the type of cattle that are being bred in various parts of Australia for that premium market of Japan. The United States is a big consumer of Australian beef, but most of it is hamburger beef, as Senator MacGibbon knows full well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just on that point&mdash;and I made that point here in the chamber two days ago&mdash;I will read what today's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock and Land</EMPHASIS> says on this crisis. It talks about the closures and goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strong Australian dollar (against United States' and Japanese currency), and a glut of American beef in Japan, have been blamed by processors for the closures.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what I told this parliament two days ago. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMH general manager for abattoirs and industrial relations, John Hughes, said this week the company could not continue to run abattoirs which he called "uneconomical".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The essential reasons why the works have been closed is due to the current beef market situation, together with livestock prices and processing costs which are uneconomic when compared to the rest of the world," Mr Hughes said.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a whole range of issues. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marketing manager for one of Victoria's largest export works, Owen Robinson of G &amp; K O'Connor, Pakenham, said before the closures, the Japanese grass-fed market had been swamped by northern cattle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Generally, there has been far too much product produced in the north over the past few months. Grass-fed product has been saturated into Japan, and they just can't digest the volumes the north has been pushing."</PARA>
<PARA>That is in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock and Land</EMPHASIS> that I picked up this morning. What it demonstrates is that there are a range of factors that are currently affecting what I and the government hopes will be the temporary closure of abattoirs in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I am pleased to be able to tell the Senate that the outlook for the beef industry is a positive one. The ABARE September quarter Australian commodities paper identified, as I told the Senate, two key parameters for the beef industry in 1995-96&mdash;that is, following improved seasonal conditions, higher prices are expected for Australian beef producers, and record levels of beef production in the United States will restrict Australia's prospects for beef exports to that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE forecasts that the Australian saleyard indicator price for cattle will rise by over four per cent to 218c a kilogram in 1995-96, an increase of 9c per kilo over 1994-95 and 16c per kilo over 1992-93. The rise will depend on a return to average seasonal conditions in northern Australia that will induce beef producers to rebuild their herds. It is a positive outlook. As Senator Boswell said, quite accurately, we are currently trading $3 billion worth of Australian beef on the world market. It is a positive outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for cattle for restocking is likely to pick up as warmer weather leads to increased pasture production. We are about to get into that phase now, providing we continue to get helpful rain. The dampening demand for Australian beef in the United States is beyond Australia's control and it is due to the cattle and pig production cycles peaking together in the United States. US cattle numbers have increased, as I told the Senate, by six per cent since 1990 to 114.3 million by July this year. It appears that this herd building, however, is now slowing, holding the prospect in the medium term of the US demand for Australian beef returning to normal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the US cattle cycle and the prosperity of the Australian beef industry is very well known to Australian beef producers&mdash;peak demand and returns and, of course the opposite way, troughs. But a very positive development for northern producers is the increasing demand for live cattle in South-East Asia that is forecast to increase by 20 per cent to around 475,000 in 1995-96. The live cattle trade has been an enormous boost for beef producers in the Northern Territory and Queensland&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I absolutely dispute your interjection that live cattle exports are not value adding. I am profoundly disturbed to hear you say that. You're wrong, Senator MacGibbon. Live cattle exports from Australia are a value added industry. Just have a look at the indirect income that those live cattle exports generate. They do add value to the product, Senator MacGibbon, despite your misconceptions. I suppose, to be fair, you may have a Queensland bias attached to those comments, so I forgive you for them. But you are not right. It is a value added industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the drought&mdash;which has had a real impact, as Senator MacGibbon would know full well, being a Queensland producer&mdash;and flat demand in the United States, the total beef exports from Australia are forecast to decline by five per cent to around 743,000 tonnes. This will be offset by expected increases in beef exports to Japan and Korea which are expected to grow by two per cent and 17 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pertinent to note that beef exports to Japan&mdash;our highest value and volume market, as Senator Boswell correctly said&mdash;have grown consistently each year, from 251 kilotons in 1992-93 to a forecast 327 kilotons in 1995-96. I think those few statistics indicate that there is a very high prospect that these current problems, which are regrettable and which are being experienced by Queensland abattoirs, will be short lived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Korean market is also showing solid growth, from 69 kilotons in 1992-93 to a forecast 82 kilotons in 1995-96, and holds considerable promise for the future as its market liberalises towards the year 2000. Increased returns in Japan and Korea are likely to mean that the total value of Australian beef exports will increase in 1995-96. ABARE forecasts an increase in the overall value of beef exports to $2.9 billion&mdash;Senator Boswell got it right; it is a $3 billion market&mdash;up from $2.8 billion in 1994-95. At the same time, our domestic beef consumption is forecast to increase by three per cent to 36 kilos per person in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also add that a number of other factors, such as the outcome of the Uruguay Round, have had very positive results, in particular&mdash;I have commented on this before&mdash;for our beef producers. That was recognised by the Cattle Council, which congratulated the government for its `tireless work and success'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Booz-Allen report&mdash;which has been mentioned on many occasions and on which I have previously commented&mdash;identified, as part of the 30 per cent of the problem that is in the hands of industry to fix, improved work practices in meatworks. As I told the Senate the other day, AMH is engaged right now in its abattoirs at Rockhampton in an exercise to do just that in cooperation with the unions and under the supervision of the Industry Commission.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what the Booz-Allen report also said, and which no coalition senator is prepared to acknowledge, is that a problem equal in percentage terms to the work practice problem is the type of cattle being supplied to the export market. Small, grass-fed animals are not appropriate for that particular market. So, as well as improving work practices, beef producers also have to improve actual cattle types. Senator MacGibbon is shaking his head but I know many primary producers who are doing precisely that to improve their herds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude where I started: it must be a very strange crisis in the beef industry if, during two weeks of sitting, the coalition shadow minister for primary industry has said absolutely nothing about it in parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I rise to speak in this debate on the cattle industry to support most of what Senator Ian Macdonald has said in support of his motion. I must say that it bothers me that we get into these debates on an ideological basis and chuck accusations backwards and forwards across the chamber when the crisis, not only in the cattle industry but in many agricultural primary industries, is such that we all need to put our best minds to the problem. Rather than accusing one section or the other, we should try to work together for some solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight what I am going to do is not give solutions but perhaps pose some questions that have not been posed so far in this debate. I do this in terms of my conversations with a number of friends that I have who are cattle producers in Queensland, after talking to meatworkers in North Queensland about their problems with management in some of the meatworks there, having been rung by at least one rural commentator with his reflections on the problems in the industry, and having had a very interesting conversation yesterday with one person who is both a live cattle exporter as well as a processed meat product exporter and who had his own ideas about what was going on in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just before the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) goes, I must say to him that I was puzzled by his abuse of Senator MacGibbon. I thought Senator MacGibbon was saying something that was quite accurate&mdash;that live cattle and live sheep exports could hardly be called value added. Surely they are at the bottom of value adding. That is my understanding about what value adding is. I could not understand the minister's response to Senator MacGibbon at all, because I thought it was a fair comment. Live cattle and sheep exports, whatever they might be, surely are not value adding in that particular industry. I did not understand the minister's response at all. I think Senator MacGibbon was actually quite accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let me raise the questions that have been raised with me on a number of occasions by the groups of people that I have just described. These for me are questions. I do not have the answers. They certainly were serious questions, and they were serious when they were raised with me yesterday by a person&mdash;and I am not going to tell the person's name or the company of which he is the proprietor&mdash;and he raised them with me because his family has been in meat production and processing for a number of generations in southern Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He asked questions not simply about work practices by workers in meatworks but about the ownership, for instance, of Australian meat holdings&mdash;overseas ownership&mdash;and whether or not some of these work practices are a deliberate ploy on the part of companies owned overseas who would rather see their overseas producers&mdash;and I am talking about the United States&mdash;operate in our markets. He said to me that some of the work practices by Australian meat holdings in southern Queensland&mdash;despite what the minister said about work practices in Rockhampton&mdash;have question marks over them. I would like answers to these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He raised the issues of double shifts, reduced productivity on the part of management, lowered kills, minimum wages, and the attitudes to workers: all of which he claimed, as a meat processor, were deliberate&mdash;at least that was his accusation&mdash;attempts to reduce productivity in Australia so that American producers could sell their product into our markets, particularly in Japan. Certainly, press reports in recent days about a glut in the Japanese market because of the supply from America and Europe underline and reinforce at least the asking of that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have an answer, but I believe that it must be asked. Where are the restrictive trade practices? Are they simply on the part of workers, as seems to be the accusation that is made often, or do they perhaps come from somewhere else? Certainly, if we are going to get answers for our primary industry, particularly our meat industry, we are going to have to sit down together and address all of the questions which are before us. I do not believe that ideological debates take us very far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed with the breakfast put on by the Cattle Council yesterday that I attended and the document which they supplied to us. I hope the kind of spirit of cooperation that they projected ought to be in this industry can be followed through, although they also seemed to be laying the blame at the feet of mainly work practices and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, it is an industry which all of us are committed to and one which we need to seek answers for. We need to take on board, therefore, all of the questions which are being asked.

There are very few industries that have taken a cut of 50 per cent in their product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cattle industry is the fourth largest export earner for Australia. It is about a $4.4 billion industry internally. Its total value to the Australian economy is estimated to be in excess of $7.7 billion. It employs over 120,000 directly and indirectly over half a million&mdash;600,000-odd&mdash;Australians. But the industry is in crisis at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister bewailed the fact that no-one has raised that in the parliament. Given the government that we have and its total antipathy to rural interests, there is no point in raising things in this parliament because we will not get any response from a minister who makes the types of statements he did in his speech. All we can say about him is that he is trying, but he has no real understanding of the industry or he would not make statements such as live export trade was value adding or the problem with the beasts going into abattoirs, according to Booz-Allen, is that they are small and grass fed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone in the industry, I can say to senators there is an acute interest in herd selection to meet the market&mdash;the Jap ox market, the Korean market and the rest of it. They all have a very high place within the consciousness of cattle producers, because there is an old dictum in the cattle business that you have to meet the market. You cannot go producing what you think is a product that the market wants, and certainly you cannot dictate the price for it. For an industry that is very much a price taker, we certainly do meet the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that we have at present are compounded by a lot of things. The minister was correct when he said there are a lot of difficulties at present. We are in the fifth year of a huge drought in Queensland. No-one in the southern part of the continent, where there has been average or above average rainfalls roughly on a line from Sydney to Perth for the last four or five years, realises this. But Central Queensland is in a desperate position because of the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we are now into the fifth year of it. The industry has been extremely badly hurt by that. The best you can hope for is to break even and a lot of people have gone very deeply into debt. But because of the strictures, the pasture improvements, the running repairs, the new equipment and even the herd improvements that would normally take place, have not been done because no-one has got the money to do that. It is really a matter of survival and it has been survival for the last four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to that, we have seen&mdash;this is quite illogical; it does not fit in with any economic theory&mdash;given the strictures of the drought, this incredibly low price for cattle at the present time. The final straw that is breaking the camel's back is the closure of so many abattoirs in the Queensland area. Queensland is the centre of the cattle industry in Australia. It is certainly the heart of the export market. We are very much on the brink of a precipice at the present time, teetering on the edge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to move to the heart of this debate, which is the failures of the government to do something to alleviate the problems the industry suffers from. It is an industry that is of great value, as I said before, to the people of Australia. We are suffering from huge and avoidable oncosts that have been imposed on us by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have archaic labour relations. That can be seen very clearly not only in the abattoir position but in relation to the wharves. The present minister for primary industries is the very same minister who resided over the WIRA reform, the reconstruction of the Australian wharves. He spent $400 million of taxpayers' money. All the analyses now show that productivity on the Australian wharves is even worse than it was before they spent that $400 million on it. In other words, we have gone back. As an export trader, we have to get product out. We in Australia pay three times what it costs in the United States and twice what it costs in New Zealand to have a beast slaughtered. They are our chief competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the business that I do not have time to go into but which I think is very relevant&mdash;Senator Woodley raised it&mdash;about overseas ownership of abattoirs. The biggest competitor America faced in the Japanese market was Australia. When some of the principal Australian meatworks engaged in  export trade are owned by the Americans now, you have to question the motives when they close down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abattoirs have great market power in the industry. They are the gateway through which everything passes. They are the price setters. They dictate the price the producer gets. They write the overseas contracts; they are all written by the individual abattoirs. They dictate in every sense what is happening in the export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need to reform our labour relations. We need new and many more modern abattoirs so that we can get our processing costs down. We need to do something about the inspection charges. We pay $60 million a year in inspection charges, which our competitors have funded out of the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the really key areas for us with long-term significance is the great cuts this government has made to CSIRO. CSIRO enabled the industry to be a world leader through all its research on pasture improvement, animal nutrition, animal health, breeding programs and the rest. That is all gone. In my own state of Queensland the DPI, which was an excellent department, has been cut right to the bone by the Labor government and is now almost ineffectual. When you talk to the DPI, they say, `The Labor government tells us there are no votes in it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have difficulties with misguided environmental programs. All of us want to improve our land, but there is no movement made to restrict or buy back marginal lands for cattle grazing where there is great damage to the environment because it is unsuitable for cattle production. Ill-considered comments on land clearance, about trees, are having a great impact on future development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, must declare an interest in this debate because I have been involved in the cattle industry all my life, even though I do not talk about it every day. It is left to one of my partners to look after it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that Senator Carr left the chamber because there are a few things I wanted to tell him. In his delivery he told us that this side of politics, the abattoir operators and the farmers are trying to reduce conditions and pay of abattoir workers&mdash;and nothing could be further from the truth. But he will get a reply to that statement in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to make is: does anyone in this place know what price farmers at present are getting for their cattle; and how far back does the present price for cattle go&mdash;for how long has the rate which is paid at present continued to be paid? I can tell the Senate that at present the prices for cattle on the hoof are exactly the same as they have been since 1976. There has been a certain amount of improvement on the per head situation; I believe that per head of cattle production is now 24 per cent more than it was in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in real terms, the price cattle farmers and cattle producers receive at present is less than they were receiving in 1976. What is more, that same price was being paid in 1972. That price was being paid in 1970, 1971 and 1972. Then in 1973 there was a big crash in the cattle market. But it came back up somewhat to a level field in 1976. So per head it is around $600 to $700 for a 20-month-old steer delivered to the abattoir gate, which is exactly the same as it was in 1976 or 1972. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So can Senator Carr tell me where cattle producers in any way are ripping off any abattoir workers? He makes himself ridiculous by making such a statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr then went on to criticise our use of the Booz-Allen figures to demonstrate the advantage that the Americans have over us when it comes to slaughtering costs. He said that, of course, the big problem with the Australian industry is the cost of the cattle themselves. But the prices that the farmers and producers are being paid for their cattle have returned to those of 1972. So in no way does that argument stand up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the liberty of taking a page from the Booz-Allen report to do comparisons with the American market. The figure to land beef on the table in the United States&mdash;perhaps not necessarily on the table, but probably in the butcher shop&mdash;is $A4.34 a kilo. You then look at the prime animal cost. The prime animal cost in Australia is $A3.40 a kilo; in the United States it is $A4.65. That is what the farmers are getting in the United States&mdash;$A4.65 a kilo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you take off the sort of revenue that comes from the by-products of the meat, the net cost of getting the animal into the abattoir in Australia is $A2.84 per kilo; in the United States it is $A3.83. So United States farmers have an advantage of approximately 99.5c per kilo over Australian farmers. That is the cost advantage they have. They pay that much more for the animal in America and yet end up with the same price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through the rest of the costs. We then come to the processing. This is where Australia, with its industrial relations and tally system, is behind. In Australia&mdash;even though Senator Collins said that he believed this figure was not right&mdash;it costs 112.7c per kilo to put through the abattoir; in the United States it costs 41.2c per kilo. So the United States has an advantage of 71.5c per kilo. That is the sort of advantage the Americans have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then when you land the meat in America, from America itself and from Australia, there is a big difference in the freight. So we will allow for that. It only costs Americans 9.7c per kilo for their transport and it costs them 37.7c a kilo from Australia. Of course that cost of 37c per kilo includes our inefficient waterfront, but let us get away from that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking everything into consideration&mdash;the freight to land it in America and their freight to get it to their tables or the butcher shop&mdash;we are behind by 44c a kilo. That is what we are behind. So the farmers in America are able to get far more than our farmers can get and still land the product on the table over there at the same price. So the table from which I have been reading certainly points out the figures as to why Australian farmers are so disadvantaged within the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on to the issue of industrial relations. In Western Australia, Greens, which are well known for their abattoirs over there, have had industrial relations problems this week. They offered a 10 per cent increase over two years, with a guaranteed six per cent increase next year. But the union wanted more and they went out on strike all of last week. So Greens returned with a lockout on Monday until there is more commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kimberleys of Western Australia is a very important area for the cattle industry. The abattoirs have all had to close there because of the situation of industrial relations over the last 10 to 15 years. As a result there are none in the north. There is not one abattoir operating from Katherine, right around the west coast and down to Geraldton. There is not one abattoir there. What has that resulted in? The build-up of the live cattle industry. It is a good industry; but, unfortunately, with the live cattle industry going out, there is less work for Australian meatworkers or for anybody else. So that has been a very unfortunate result of the industrial relations up there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being a cattle grower and, like others, being in an area where I could grow something else, for what is in it, it is not really worthwhile to keep going at this rate. If it was up to me, we would probably out cattle and grow wheat, or run sheep or something like that. But there are a lot of farmers in Australia who, unfortunately, are in areas where they can grow only cattle, so they have to stay with it. But, as I have said before, I do not know why farmers in other situations bother to keep going at these prices. There is a lot of lot feeding now. I will give the lot feeders a bit of warning: the grain growers will not stand for importing subsidised grain every year as they did last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You didn't, Senator Panizza; but a number of other speakers did. Before I go into that, I just want to pick up one of the issues that were raised on research and development. There was the allegation that there has been significant cutbacks by the Commonwealth in R&amp;D. This is simply not true. There is the perpetuation or the creation of this myth in respect to agricultural research in Australia from the Commonwealth perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a very impressive record of R&amp;D contributions. We match dollar for dollar. It is this government that has established most of the rural research corporations. In 1985-86, when the Meat Research Corporation began, industry contribution was $5.54 million and Commonwealth contribution, dollar for dollar, was the same. If you look at the steady growth up until this year, 1994-95, you will see that the Meat Research Corporation levy was $22 million and the Commonwealth contributed $22 million. So we have seen total Commonwealth contributions of over $150 million in R&amp;D since the R&amp;D corporation began back in 1984-85 as an initiative of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there have been some reductions in the CSIRO research funds, but that is more than offset by the moneys the Commonwealth pays through the research and development corporations. Senator MacGibbon referred to the cutbacks in Queensland at a state level. That may well be the case. However, there have been cutbacks in research in state departments under all state governments, regardless of who has been in power&mdash;Labor or Liberal. Go to Victoria. There has been a lot of ill feeling between the National Party and the Liberal government about the cutbacks in rural R&amp;D in Victoria under the Kennett government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that these cutbacks are occurring, but this Commonwealth commitment has been very solid and very substantial and it is increasing over time&mdash;not just in the meat industry but right across the rural sector. I have the other figures here, but I will not go into that this evening. But we have a very strong commitment in the R&amp;D area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Booz-Allen and Hamilton report has received fairly significant comment in this debate. The critical issue here is the opposition's lack of balance. The input costs of labour certainly are a major factor with respect to the difference in the performance gap. There is no denying that. If you look at the table on page 55, you will see that 23 per cent of the gap was technology work practices; that is, labour costs. But that category is not just labour costs. I have been to a few meatworks in this country over the last couple of years and some of them are so antiquated and out of date. That does account for part of that 23 per cent performance gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some other factors that are just as important. One that the minister referred to is the smaller, leaner animals that are supplied to the meatworks. But the most important issue with respect to this performance gap is that 34 per cent is distance from market. Regrettably, in Australia this problem is very hard to overcome because of the sheer distance associated with the transportation of animals to the coast and then beyond. We are a big country, unlike New Zealand which does not face that sort of distance from market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to touch on the industrial relations issue. There has been an adoption of new technologies. Individual works have been tackling key issues, such as enterprise agreements. They have been focusing on site productivity problems. Double shifting under the current award is being introduced in a number of operations. They have been seeking alternative market opportunities. The study identified that major opportunities lie in facility rationalisation and specialisation. That is just not an area of union or work force responsibility. Management has a lot to answer for in this area of the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people in the press and in the opposition have alleged that there are very few enterprise agreements. The figure of six has been given, but there are now more than 34 enterprise agreements in the meat industry. In some instances, major meat processors have been working under enterprise agreements for three years. Employers speak of productivity improvements of around 10 to 15 per cent. In Victoria some companies are currently working on their second round of enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the responsibility for initiating and driving reform and for ensuring that employees understand and accept the need for and direction of reform rests with industries' individual employers. It does not just rest with the union movement or the work force. If you were fair and reasonable in a balanced debate about this issue of workplace reform, you would talk to some employers and middle management on a meat site and you would talk to some workers. I would have to say that it is the most intractable, dogmatic, determined, inflexible set of relationships that I have struck in any work site I have ever been to. The nature of the work at meatworks is not very pleasant. Many of the middle management and management people come from the shopfloor. Industrial relations is not easy at the meatworks or plant level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought has been a significant factor; there is no doubt about that. I only have a small amount of time left, so I will not say too much about this issue, other than to say that drought has been a significant issue, particularly in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other issue I want to touch on. I had the opportunity to meet a Swedish delegation this week and voice my concern about Sweden's entry into the European Community and the effect of losing a $20 million a year meat market as a consequence. We are still arguing about compensation with the European Community. This also highlights one of the disadvantages we have in world markets. Despite that particular problem, generally the outcome of GATT benefits the meat industry, particularly in this country. </PARA>

Their contribution to the debate has been most valuable. They are people who have an understanding of the industry and an understanding of those problems. From the Labor Party we have the old tired, class warfare type arguments, typified by Senator Carr's speech. Senator Carr is a great mate of Wally Curran, who is acknowledged as single-handedly having practically destroyed the meat processing industry in Victoria. We had the old class warfare argument, which we on this side do not accept.

Not once have we been given a proper response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to take this opportunity briefly to answer Senator Collins. Whenever he has nothing to say in the Senate, he attacks Mr John Anderson, the shadow minister for primary industries. Mr Anderson is in the other House. Of course, he cannot ask questions of Senator Collins, not that it would be of any use to him if he could because he would never get an answer. There is no-one in the other chamber in the Labor Party who has any interest in primary industry matters, so it is pointless Mr Anderson asking questions in the other place. Mr Anderson does ask questions through his representatives in this chamber&mdash;the people who represent him on the coalition side. He gives information to Senator Boswell, myself, Senator Panizza and people interested in primary industries matters. We ask questions of Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Anderson has a very close connection with the beef cattle industry. He has been around seeing those groups. He continuously does so. He understands their problems and he consults with them. In fact, he has a very close rapport with them. In government after the next election Mr Anderson will make a very fine contribution to Australia in the primary industries field and will certainly make his mark on putting in place the sorts of reforms that are necessary to get the cattle industry going. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its findings not only have the capacity to reflect on the legality of Cabinet's decision, but on the extent to which the Senate and the Parliament can keep some control over how the executive government can spend money on itself . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That, I think, is a crucial question. Let us then turn to the question of the legal basis for the decision by the cabinet to fund Dr Lawrence in this matter. At the outset we have sections 81 and 83 of the constitution, which provide that there must be parliamentary approval for the appropriation of money; that is, in order for money to be taken from the consolidated revenue fund, parliament must firstly pass a bill. As well as that, we have section 48 of the constitution, which provides that parliament must specifically approve benefits to members and senators. It is with that in mind that we look at the legal basis for this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence before the committee, the government stated that it had three courses of action available to it: firstly, the enactment of a single line appropriation; secondly, payment under section 34A of the Audit Act, which would constitute an act of grace; and, thirdly, payment out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which was allegedly supported by legislative authority under the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government decided on the latter course. Senator Gareth Evans gave evidence that the act of grace payment was a second option. In evidence before the committee, Dr Gavan Griffith, the Solicitor-General, said that may be a legal course of action. But it was obvious that the government's preferred course of action was to make this payment from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that needs to be asked is: would such a payment meet the requirements set out in the legislation establishing the Advance to the Minister for Finance and, if so, would the requirement of section 48 of the constitution, which I mentioned earlier&mdash;that allowances to members of parliament be determined by parliament&mdash;be satisfied by the Parliamentary Entitlements Act? That is really the nub of the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the High Court decision of Brown and West, section 48 of the constitution was considered. The outcome of that case was that the government needed more specific legislative authority than simply the Advance to the Minister for Finance to support its decision to pay costs. This was, I believe, applicable to the situation we have before us. Indeed, Mr Lindell of the University of Melbourne stated that the Parliamentary Entitlements Act did not really vary the decision in Brown and West; it formulated it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a problem there. But, as well as that, we have the question of the provisions&mdash;and I refer to division 864 of the Advance to the Minister for Finance&mdash;which enable a minister to make advances during the financial year that will make money available for expenditure if the minister is satisfied that it is urgently required and that it was unforeseen. Of course, it must be for the purposes of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where the government also comes to grief because the government cannot establish that this was urgently required. This decision to pay Dr Lawrence's fees was made on 8 June. It is now 28 September and still we do not have any payments being made. There was a real cause of concern raised as to the question of urgency. There is also the question of `purposes of the Commonwealth'. Is it really only a purpose of the government? That is a question which needs to be asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions dealing with advances to the Minister for Finance, we have those hurdles which I believe that the government has great difficulty in negotiating. I might also point out that section 4 (4)(b) of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act provides for the payment of benefits to a minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a minister. I put to the Senate that there are real problems in this matter in that a challenge to the royal commission by Dr Lawrence is not really for the purpose of carrying out her functions as a minister, but more to preserving her as staying on as a minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the hearing the committee heard evidence that there was a distinction between the functions of a minister as opposed to continuing to remain as a minister. There are profound problems with the course of action which is proposed by the government. I submit that should the government embark on this course there will be real problems as far as any unlawful expenditure goes. I refer to the Auckland Harbour principle which allows for governments to recover monies which are unlawfully paid out. That would possibly entail recovery of money from people to whom it was paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would say that the government really did not receive sufficient advice when it made this serious decision in cabinet. As Senator Gareth Evans stated, it really amounted to bits and pieces. That is just not sufficient for a government when it is making such an important decision and setting such an important precedent as this. </PARA>

There is no getting away from that matter. I recognise the position my colleagues from the opposition were in.

I wonder whether that would have been the case if we were not in such a highly charged political environment. </PARA>

I commend, as I have done in my additional comment, the efforts of the Chairman, Senator Ellison, to get a representative from the Western Australian government here. It was not that the only situation we wanted was to have a representative here in a physical sense; we also made the opportunity available for a representative of the Western Australian government to give evidence by video&mdash;at some cost to the parliament. </PARA>

Off the record, I suggested to Senator Ellison that it might be good experience for Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, the Western Australian Attorney-General, to appear before the committee. She probably will get some experience in the future. </PARA>

It is unfortunate that in royal commissions we now have defendants, prosecutors and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application Dr Lawrence made to the Premier was by a letter dated 18 May. She did not get a formal response to that correspondence telling her how much money was going to be available, how many lawyers were going to be available and so on until the executive officer of the Ministry of the Premier and Cabinet responded by letter to her lawyers on 14 September. If the Commonwealth had not gone ahead and made the indemnification at the time it did&mdash;which was on 9 June&mdash;Dr Lawrence would have been proverbially up the creek without a paddle. She had to wait four months to be told that Mr Court was going to be mean spirited in what he was going to allow to be paid to her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement of this decision has come four months after the application was made&mdash;after Dr Lawrence physically appeared before the commission; after the commission itself had been given an extension of time; and after the commissioner made that extraordinary statement which he repeated when he presented an amended set of issues, when he set out for the public eye a list of issues which he considered could be grounds for possible adverse findings against Dr Lawrence.

I will come back to that detail at a later point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members on the other side assert constantly in public&mdash;under the Goebbels principle that if you keep repeating it people believe it&mdash;that the only reason this commission was called was that Dr Lawrence is a popular federal Labor minister and there was a perceived need to somehow get at her and diminish her standing. I do not accept that proposition. I think it is a laughable proposition that a state government would put itself at risk by making a decision to spend several millions of dollars on this. For what? To assist its federal party, now in opposition? To spend that much money for that purpose is laughable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no benefit to the Western Australian government in pursuing this commission if the only purpose in pursuing it is to damage Dr Lawrence. Why would a government put itself so at risk&mdash;when it would have to go back to its taxpayers and say, `We think we spent this money wisely'&mdash;if the only reason it could use to justify it was that Dr Lawrence in some way needed damaging. It is egocentric argument taken to the quintessential extreme&mdash;as though Dr Lawrence is the centre of everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the proposition at all that this commission was called only because Dr Lawrence eventually ended up a federal government minister. I say that the reason the commission was called and for her involvement in it is not that she is a federal government minister at the moment but that, at the relevant time of the matters being inquired into, she was the state's prime minister, otherwise known as the Premier. That is the reason she is involved in this. It has nothing to do with what she is doing now at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very sad reflection on the way this government has chosen to handle this argument. It has chosen to politicise a commission that, in my view, was not politicised. It has dragged it&mdash;a commission that cannot respond on its own behalf; at least the commissioners and staff of the commission cannot&mdash;into the public arena and has sought to rubbish it up hill and down dale. We know that this government was determined to do that. We knew that when the announcement was made that a commission would be called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Labor members have issued fair and clear warnings&mdash;I say `fair' not in the sense that I think the warnings were fair but that it was perfectly clear what they were saying: `If you get involved in this commission, you do so at your own risk.' No member of the judiciary, no former member of the judiciary and no member of the profession with any self-respect would get involved. The attacks started before we even knew what the terms of reference were. They continued when the terms of reference were released and they continued to shift to attacks on the commissioner and counsel assisting. It has been a relentless attack by this government on this commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the reason for that attack is quite clear&mdash;because they have a perceived need to protect one of their own. They will do anything in order to do that, including attacking a properly constituted commission, former members of the judiciary and members of the legal profession who are simply doing their job. This is the old-time Labor philosophy: if you can't run it, wreck it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the purpose of the Senate committee inquiry was to establish whether the government's decision was a legal one.

It may come as a shocking surprise to members opposite to understand that there are limits on what the Commonwealth government can do. It cannot spend at will. It has to spend in accordance with the constitution and in accordance with acts of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the purpose of the inquiry of the Senate committee. It was not anything, in a sense, to do with politics, although all of us here are; it was a question of whether the government is acting legally. That is the opposition's job. I think it is a perfectly fair case to say that it is not. If money is paid out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, it is an illegal payment and could probably be collected back from those who made the decision and those who received the money, but that is a moot point. All I am concerned about is whether it is a legal payment, whether the Commonwealth is acting legally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a shocking surprise to taxpayers to find that the Commonwealth had no written legal advice on the legality of its decision to pay at the time it made the decision. It was only when some journalists, perhaps acting independently from the coalition, raised the question of the legality that it thought it had better get a bit of advice. It got that advice from the Solicitor-General, and that advice is not 100 per cent clear. It does not say, `It is without a shadow of a doubt possible and perfectly legal for the Commonwealth to pay under the bills it is suggesting it can.' It says `the Commonwealth may reasonably'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who went to law school understands why they spent a couple of weeks explaining the difference between `may' and `shall'. `Shall' is a definite. That is what the Solicitor-General's opinion should have said if he wanted to make it unequivocally clear that the Commonwealth was entitled to so spend this money. His opinion then would have said, `It is without doubt within the Commonwealth's power to spend the money according to these acts.' But his opinion is not like that; it is laden with doubt. The reason it is laden with doubt is that he himself can see the concern we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth must spend for a Commonwealth purpose. It is not in the constitution that it is a Commonwealth purpose to pay the minister's legal fees. So who else can define what a Commonwealth purpose is? This parliament can.

If this government is so convinced that this is a proper use of taxpayers' money, it should put it to the test and ask parliament if it wants to spend the money this way.

The second one is whether the timing, extent and method of payment that the government wishes to undertake has a sound legal basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a distinction between those two matters and note that other speakers so far have not made that distinction. But I am making that distinction because cabinet made that decision and it now has to demonstrate the reasons for that decision. However, at this stage no payment has been made. The government, therefore, has a range of options before it actually proceeds to meet its commitment and make those payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will even now put my conclusion on the second point on the table. That is, while cabinet has certainly the right to make an executive decision in its execution in this matter of expending public funds, it must seek parliamentary approval before it can do so. There may be some ways in which it can avoid that, but I believe that they are fraught with difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seeking to determine the legal basis for the cabinet decision, I believe that we must have regard to the state of knowledge cabinet had at the time when it was making it. Thus, it is not relevant that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said at a later date that the outcome would not affect Dr Lawrence's position as a minister, or that commissioner Marks himself expressed doubts about the effect the commission's work might have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cabinet made the decision in ignorance of these developments but also, apparently, without obtaining a comprehensive legal opinion on the basis for its proposed course of action except, according to Senator Gareth Evans, in bits and pieces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cabinet did not request or receive a statement from Dr Lawrence on the legal strategy she intended to pursue, including the challenge to the validity of the commission. While I believe that challenge is certainly within customary legal practice&mdash;and there is plenty of precedent for that before royal commissions to challenge the jurisdiction, the validity and constitutionality of a royal commission, so I have no objection to that being included in the consideration, although objections were raised by the opposition speakers on that point&mdash;I believe there are implications for the quantum of costs that would be affected by the strategy that Dr Lawrence would propose. And it is strange that cabinet made that decision without consultation on the strategy she decided to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, no attempt was made, on the basis of the evidence before the committee, to put in place a monitoring system, a consulting system on her future intentions on her strategy and, therefore, on the level of cost that could be expected. The cost implications of a strategy are quite different from the `fair and reasonable' quantum measure that would be applied by the Attorney-General's Department in determining whether a particular bill should be paid or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these matters are somewhat poor management but do not of themselves negate the basis for the cabinet decision. That decision clearly rests on the proposition that the WA royal commission is a politically motivated attempt to damage or oust a Commonwealth minister and that it is directly and necessarily related to her capacity to function as a minister. I believe that, in general terms, this proposition has merit. It is highly improbable that the WA commission would have been initiated if Dr Lawrence were in private practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A search of previous royal commissions involving politicians did not disclose any royal commission that was not in some way related to criminal behaviour. Even the WA Premier is not alleging that Dr Lawrence could be guilty of that. Further, the behaviour complained of, misleading the parliament of WA, in summary is, by analogy, relevant to the minister's capacity to function in the Commonwealth parliament&mdash;a major part of her ministerial duties and the circumstance which distinguishes the allegation from purely personal misdemeanours where government provision of defence costs would certainly not be justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of these considerations, it is arguable that the decision by cabinet can, on balance, be brought within the provision of section 81 of the constitution, which requires expenditure to be `for the purposes of the Commonwealth'. However, the proposed payment must also be brought within section 83 of the constitution, which requires payments to be made as a result of an appropriation of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since no payment has yet been made, the federal government, as I said, is now able to consider three options. The first two are: an act of grace payment under section 34(a) of the Audit Act, which would be considered an avenue of last resort; and the enactment of a single-line appropriation in an appropriation bill, which would satisfy both the requirement of section 83 of the constitution, because it would be an appropriation made by law, and also section 48, because parliament would specifically enact a provision giving this pecuniary benefit to a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Payment under the Advance to the Minister for Finance supported by the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 is the third option. This would certainly enable payment of the legal bills as they fell due but I believe presents certain difficulties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter is a matter of great importance. It is a matter of great principle. Basically, this case boils down to one simple question: should ministers of the Crown be above the law which is set out in the constitution and which applies in this country? I believe the answer is that they should not. What has happened in relation to Dr Lawrence's legal expenses is that Dr Lawrence's colleagues in the cabinet have voted to meet legal expenses on her behalf to which she is not entitled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a basic issue of law. It is a very basic principle that a cabinet which takes unto itself powers it should not have is as injurious to democracy as a dictator who takes unto himself or herself powers that they should not have. Let me elaborate for honourable senators why I believe it is the case that cabinet here has voted legal benefits to Dr Lawrence to which she is not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a basic fact&mdash;and it is set out in sections 81 and 83 of the constitution&mdash;that money cannot be expended except by appropriation. What we have here is a decision to vote moneys to Dr Lawrence other than by appropriation. It is clearly a case that the moneys could not be paid out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance for the simple reason that the matters are not urgent. Moreover, the payments cannot fall into the category of payments which could be made to a minister of the Crown lawfully as payments made in relation to that minister are benefits forwarded by the government to a minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a minister. I shall turn to the second matter very briefly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first question of whether this payment is urgent, the answer is quite simply not. The reason put before the committee at the hearings was that the payment was urgent as there was a bill on hand. But the bill on hand still has not been paid. So the matter was quite clearly not urgent. It was not a matter of whether payment had to be made before parliament returned; it was quite within the competence of the government to arrange for a single-line appropriation to be brought before the House and then brought before the Senate in the first sitting day. But that did not happen. Instead, an ad hoc decision was made which had the effect of unlawfully giving a benefit to Dr Lawrence. That payment cannot be characterised as a payment to a minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a minister. Let me explain why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two alternative interpretations of what that section means. The first interpretation is a very loose interpretation, and it goes to the question of whether a minister could continue to function as a minister of the Crown. I do not accept the first interpretation. The second and, I believe, more correct interpretation is that this section was meant to authorise payments to a minister for the purposes of the exercising of his or authority and powers as a minister of the Crown and the execution of his or her responsibilities as a minister of the Crown. Quite clearly, to pay Dr Lawrence's legal expenses to appear before a royal commission&mdash;which is not inquiring into her position now or the exercise of her position now as a minister of the Crown which she currently holds&mdash;does not fit within that definition. So, on the test which I believe to be the more correct test, these payments do not qualify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is the possibility that the former test may be the more appropriate test. If that is so, I again say that these payments do not fit within that category. If one says that we should apply the broad test, and the broad test means anything which is necessary to ensure that a minister continues to function as a minister&mdash;in other words, he or she is not disqualified&mdash;then this payment is not of that nature. Why is this payment not of that nature? This payment is not of that nature because this royal commission is incapable of disqualifying Dr Lawrence as a minister of the Crown in the federal parliament. It is a simple matter of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of what the royal commissioner finds, he does not have the power to disqualify Dr Lawrence from her position as federal health minister. Even if one accepted the  broad test of what constitutes a payment for the purposes of meeting his or her functions as a minister of the Crown, and if one says that it also means continuing to function as a minister of the Crown, it does not matter what the royal commission says because it cannot disqualify Dr Lawrence. The payment does not fall within that category. Moreover, if that test were correct, there would be all sorts of undesirable results. Suppose, for example, that a minister of the Crown was facing bankruptcy proceedings that were brought by a creditor. Would it be competent for the cabinet colleagues of that minister to vote the money to that minister to defend the bankruptcy proceedings? On this basis it would, because a person who is an undischarged bankrupt is disqualified from being a member of parliament. After a period of three months, he or she would be disqualified from being a minister of the Crown. So, quite clearly, if one applies that test, a minister facing bankruptcy proceedings could have those costs borne by the Commonwealth. Worse still, if you apply that test, it might even be competent for that minister's cabinet colleagues to vote the money to meet the debts, because they are payments necessary for the minister to continue functioning as a minister of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very clearly on the evidence that these payments are unlawful. I also believe that the situation may arise where those payments may be recoverable from Dr Lawrence&mdash;for the simple reason that, although she may not receive the money herself, they have discharged a liability under a bill which was rendered to Dr Lawrence. Therefore, if those payments are unlawful and they have been applied for her benefit, then quite clearly the money may be recoverable from Dr Lawrence at some future point in time. I do very strongly believe that this is a matter of principle that must be enforced. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought Senator O'Chee made a very impressive contribution to this debate and, indeed, dealt with the law in a most impressive manner. I thought that his legal opinion, and his certainty in his legal opinion, ought be borne in mind. It is unfortunate that the government cannot rely on Senator O'Chee, because we have a Solicitor-General to whom they have to go to, in terms of the propriety of the situation, to get the advice that they act upon. It may be that Senator O'Chee should become Solicitor-General to this government; he could probably do it a lot of good. But until that happens, the government has to proceed along the lines that it does at present.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would have been pleased had somebody come before the committee and performed the same task because, as you remember, there were some very strong accusations made before our committee to the effect that this royal commission, constituted by Mr Marks QC, had been set up for political purposes. Indeed, in our dissenting opinion, we set out on page 4 a whole series of reasons why we drew that conclusion. We went on to say that Senator Gareth Evans had put, in this formal setting of the committee, allegations that he took to be true about the circumstances in which this royal commission was called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know, Mr Acting Deputy President that, between the times you were getting quite frenzied about this whole matter, you were attempting to get somebody from the Western Australian government to rebut, in the way that Senator Vanstone attempted to rebut, those allegations. Senator Vanstone was properly moved to come in here because the sorts of allegations that are being made in this matter are the sorts of allegations that need rebutting&mdash;and she has done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder why that was not done by somebody who would know the answer to these issues and who would be able to tell us with assuredness that the sorts of things that were put were not true? Here is poor Senator Vanstone, for whom you and I have great regard, as does everybody else, who does not know the details of these matters, who is not from Western Australia, who goes about her duties over here of looking after the people of Australia, acting as the shadow Attorney-General, and who feels she has to come and defend the issues put before this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why wasn't that same impulse in the breast of people from the Western Australian government who know the sorts of things that Senator Vanstone has alleged, the people who could have saved Senator Vanstone the embarrassment of coming in here to try to rebut these inferences and statements by Senator Evans that are open on the evidence? Why didn't somebody come and do that? Are we entitled, as we have done, to draw from that fact the inference that what Senator Evans was saying and what the inferences were about these commissions were true?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had doubt. We talked about these things, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President. We believed implicitly&mdash;the open-minded people that we are&mdash;that we should keep a doubt in our minds as to whether it was true. But after the reaction by the Western Australian government and after the speech tonight by Senator Vanstone, who knew that this sort of thing had to be rebutted, I suppose that you and I can only become absolutely confirmed in the opinion that this was a royal commission set up with a&mdash;we are not saying `the'&mdash;central purpose of doing damage to the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some suggestion that the legislature should stand above the executive. You and I, Mr Acting Deputy  President, agree that the parliament is the only body that can make money available for appropriations. But that does not mean to say that the executive is inferior to the parliament. The executive has got a duty to protect itself. May I read from William Blackstone; I know the Deputy Clerk will have read William Blackstone on very many occasions. In 1765, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is highly necessary for preserving the balance of the constitution, that the executive power be a branch, though not the whole of the legislative. The total union of them, we have seen, would be productive of tyranny; the total disjunction of them, for the present, would in the end produce the same effects, by causing that union against which it seems to provide. The legislative would soon become tyrannical, by making continual encroachments, and gradually assuming to itself the rights of the executive power.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate to quickly make a recap of the history of this reference. This reference arose because of community concern at the federal government's attitude in defending Dr Lawrence on the principle that this government acts under; namely, `We'll do whatever it takes.' The inquiry arose from a squalid exercise undertaken by the then Western Australian government in their attempt to torpedo Richard Court as Leader of the Opposition. Rather than being torpedoed, he of course was torpedoed into the premiership, and Dr Lawrence has now had her dirty little tactic backfire on her. She has been exposed for what she is, and people can make up their own minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that Dr Lawrence's own Deputy Premier gave evidence and a gaggle of former Labor ministers and her former staff all gave a version of events that, I must say, cast some doubt on the integrity of the evidence provided by Dr Lawrence. Because of that dilemma faced by Dr Lawrence, the Labor government, or cabinet, decided to underwrite Dr Lawrence for an action against the royal commission and for her to appear before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue in question is whether the executive or the parliament has the power to make available those funds of our fellow Australians. Senator Ellison has already very ably set out the legal situation and the relevant legal authorities. Boiled down, the essence of the debate over payment of Dr Lawrence's legal costs is whether parliament or the executive is in control of the purse strings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 48 of the constitution clearly says that there is a limit to be applied to the benefits payable to parliamentarians unless specifically provided for by the parliament in its own legislation. In other words, the executive should not be allowed to buy off parliamentarians. This parliament, in its wisdom, has passed the Remuneration Tribunal Act and also the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. Those two pieces of legislation indicate the types of allowances that are payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this situation with Dr Lawrence, the government seeks to rely on the Parliamentary Entitlements Act and, in particular, paragraph 4(4)(b), which is set out at paragraph 3.71 of the report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Benefits under this Act do not limit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) benefits afforded by the Government to a Minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, one could hardly regard the prior history of Dr Lawrence as a former Premier and the action she undertook years ago in that capacity as somehow part of her function as a minister today, as a minister in the Commonwealth government. Clearly, there can be no relationship. If there is, we have a situation where basically anything goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Robertson QC, who gave evidence to our committee, basically said, `Yep, anything goes.' I happen to believe that that was not parliament's intention, and I happen to believe that it would be unlikely that the High Court would rule that it is within the function of Dr Lawrence, as health minister, to be defended in front of a royal commission in relation to something completely outside her role as a minister for health in this federal government. Indeed, I quote from 3.87 of the report, which relates to Mr Robertson's evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The executive, of course, would never make that payment nor would, I assume, an executive ever fund divorce proceedings but it is open to the executive to do so just as it is open to an employer to give a benefit to an employee such as the payment for dog food.</PARA>
<PARA>So basically what he is saying&mdash;and the full quote is there&mdash;is that if somehow it frees up Dr Lawrence or a minister of the crown to attend to her functions, then it is appropriate for the taxpayer of Australia to pay for somebody to feed her dog so it does not bark of a night. This is the person who was seeking to substantiate the proposed payment to Dr Lawrence. How that can relate to her functions as a minister is beyond me. That is why this committee by majority took the view as expressed by Mr Morris QC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I was concerned at the attack made by you in your additional comment on Mr Morris. It is regrettable that those comments were made. Some of the comments that were made were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say I was not impressed by Mr Tony Morris&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and then over the page, that he had `come very close to misleading parliament'. If we were to rely on that opinion, one has to ask, Mr Acting Deputy President, why the senator involved, Senator Mckiernan, also co-signed the minority report, which said in paragraph 4:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view all witnesses contributed to the committee hearing with integrity.</PARA>

Lots of matters are of concern in this affair&mdash;Senator Evans telling us that he had armloads of evidence but then before the committee having to admit that it was really only bits and pieces.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report continues the long line of excellent reports we have had from the defence subcommittee over the years in this parliament. In the few minutes I have available to me tonight I want to comment on a few points in the report's final remarks. The first point I wish to comment on is the lack of air mobility in the army, especially given the recent withdrawal of the Nomad aircraft and the problems with the Black Hawk helicopters. The Black Hawk helicopter saga is one of the blackest in the Australian Defence Force's history. It is black because it is just gross mismanagement. From memory the purchase price of the helicopter fleet was around $600 million. The ancillary cost, training cost and the rest of it would have to run probably close to 60 per cent again. So the taxpayer would have probably around $800 million invested in this program. The program has been running for about 10 years now and we simply do not have any utilisation out of these aircraft. The army blames the air force and the air force blames the army for it. It is a divided administrative command with respect to maintenance and operation. Whatever the rights or wrongs of the issue, the bottom line position is that Australia just does not get the use of this asset that it made a very big investment in and an asset which is crucial for contemporary land operations&mdash;to have air mobility. I suppose out of the 36 or 38 helicopters we have in inventory we would be lucky to be able to put six on the line on any day. That is a very sad situation and absolutely inexcusable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I wish to comment on is the paying off of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS>. The most recent information the Senate legislation committee was given, at an estimates hearing, was that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> would be sold. I am personally opposed to that because the Australian Defence Forces have very little sea lift capability. Since the estimates committee hearing, the proposal has changed&mdash;I think to keep <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Resignation rates are running very high at the moment. The minister admitted in answer to a question I asked last week&mdash;he gave the answer on Monday of this week because he did not know the answer at the time&mdash;that the current resignation rates from the RAN are running at around 14.7 per cent. When you are losing over 12 per cent of the members of the defence force, you are in a very difficult situation. At 14.7 per cent, you have a crisis. Navy has great difficulty now in manning its ships and getting anything to sea. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> is apparently scheduled to be manned by reservists, but there are not the reservists around to man it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the functions of the navy that has been overlooked by this government is the provision of a sea lift capability. The Second World War, and all the operations we have been involved in since the Second World War, do require a sea lift capability to support a land force if it is operating outside of Australia. You cannot support a serious operation purely by air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> is essential in our inventory given the fact that we have only two other ships&mdash;the newly acquired 20-year-old American LSTs&mdash;for sea lift. The navy has to have the capability to support a land force in an area outside Australia, particularly if this government is to be believed in its frequent statements that it sees Australia in a role of supporting regional activities with nations in our region. I think that is quite a proper role, but there is a corollary to that. History teaches us that, if you are going to support other countries, in most cases you need a land force. That land force, as I say, has to be supported by sea. The crisis with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> has to be solved. It has to be retained in the inventory at the present time and it has to be crewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I wish to comment on is the importance of early acquisition of airborne early warning patrol aircraft. I have been in this parliament now for 17 years. My earliest statements go back to the crucial need for an airborne early warning capability for Australia. This is a huge country. There is no way we can know what is going on over our own sovereign land if we do not have a means of detecting what is happening. The way you detect air traffic and the way you detect sea traffic is by radar. It is quite impossible for Australia to put ground based radar stations around the northern half of the country. The cost would run into billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution to filling that gap is airborne early warning radar aircraft, which will not only provide surveillance of the air and sea space but with contemporary technology will give you information of land activities as well. Additionally, it will give you a command and control function. Command and control, the ability to relay information and intelligence, is as crucial as knowing what goes on. Every minister we have had in the time I have been in this parliament has preached the doctrine that there are new developments just around the corner and if we wait a little while we will get something much better and much cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the matter are that I think the first AEW aircraft flew in 1944. It might have been the early part of 1945, but it is over 50 years ago. It is true of any high technology that there are always new developments coming, but you have to get on the ladder somewhere. Australia has been grossly remiss because there is no way we can know who is coming into, leaving or approaching our country unless we have that capability. There is no other technology that can provide it for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not purely an air force requirement. It is as relevant to the navy and to the land force as it is to air force. It is a very great weakness. If you identified one weakness in our defence capability, it would be the lack of an airborne early warning capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am rather concerned at a story that is being floated off in the press, a story which obviously comes from the government and Defence, that we might be considering adding to the order of the new 130J model Hercules that we are buying to provide several platforms for an AEW aircraft. The purchase of the 130J is an excellent choice and is long overdue for the transport and air refuelling needs of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to propose that aircraft as a platform for an AEW capability is to seek yesterday's solution to tomorrow's problems. It is an unqualified aircraft in that role. It would cost us probably $50 million to $80 million or maybe $100 million to qualify it in the role before we started putting any equipment into it. It is of reasonably short range for an AEW aircraft. It has a problem in that four propellers interfere with the electromagnetic signature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only platform that we could use for an AEW aircraft, bearing in mind that we want an investment that will have a 30-year life, is a contemporary jet aircraft. The only platform available is the Boeing 760 extended range aircraft that the Japanese defence force have purchased as a platform for their AEW aircraft. They have expended $80 million just qualifying that airframe as a military airframe without putting any electronics into it. That is a sunk cost that someone else has paid for later buyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of recoiling at the cost, as many people do, of having that Boeing 767 as a platform. In the near future, we will have to get rid of the Boeing 707s, which are now roughly 30 years old. They form the only airborne fuelling capability that the RAAF has. They are long-range strategic freighting and troop transport as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will come a time in the near future when Boeing Aircraft Corporation will not support the civil version of the 707 any longer. We will then face a replacement. The intelligent thing for the government to do is to adopt a long-range plan to purchase the Boeing 767 extended range version with the military airframe. It should initially dedicate four of those airframes for an AEW capability and move progressively into acquiring a full squadron of those aircraft to provide the freight and airborne fuelling capabilities that we need. The 130J cannot be used to provide an airborne fuelling capability in an offensive environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great advantage of using the 767 is that it can be supported. It fits in very well with the government's commercial support program. We can get competition between Ansett and Qantas, who both operate these aircraft at present and will for many years ahead. So they can be supported within the civil infrastructure in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for an AEW aircraft is absolutely crucial. You have to bear in mind that, if we decided tonight to move into this program, it would be probably 10 to 15 years before we had that capability. Our neighbours in the region have it. They have had it for years. It is a glaring defect and the greatest defect in Australia's defence capability. It is one that we must fill. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in relation to the government's response to the findings and recommendations of the report by the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in Relation to the Print Media. That report related to an inquiry into the sale of the Fairfax empire, as it was known, in 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this report was tabled in June 1994, with a final oral report being given in March this year. It has taken the government 15 months to respond to the written report and six months to respond to the oral report. That is quite outstanding when you think that the normal requirement is for the government to respond within three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just take this opportunity to express my disappointment that the government has taken so long to respond to a report by a Senate select committee, and one which did raise some very important matters indeed when it was looking into this matter. The reason for that committee being set up by the Senate related to a comment by Conrad Black in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A life in progress</EMPHASIS>. In his book he claimed that, at a meeting in November 1992, Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, had agreed that Black's company, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, would be able to raise its stake in Fairfax to 25 per cent. He further claimed that the Prime Minister at the time also said that if he were re-elected&mdash;that is, the Prime Minister&mdash;and Fairfax political coverage was balanced, he would entertain an application to go higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently in a radio interview in Seattle, on 18 November 1993, Mr Keating admitted that he had sought from Conrad Black a commitment that the paper would be balanced, and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if there is any notion that, you know, of bias&mdash;that is, you barrack for the coalition on the basis of your conservative proclivities in other places, then there is no way you would qualify as the kind of owner we would like.</PARA>
<PARA>That quite squarely gives rise to the inference that the Prime Minister at the time was giving Conrad Black a very clear message as to how he wanted Conrad Black to behave. But the Prime Minister also went on in that interview to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So therefore after the election I, on behalf of the government, made good a commitment to reconsider them and took them to 25 per cent. At the time Black only had 15 per cent in Fairfax and of course the increase of the decision to 25 per cent was crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was that, during the course of the inquiry by this committee, there were other aspects which came to light which proved to be totally unsatisfactory. I note that not only does the government quite arrogantly dismiss the committee's finding in relation to the statements made by the Prime Minister about the increase of Mr Black's holding, but it also ignores essentially the recommendation made by the committee in relation to the operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to cast one's mind back to the situation that took place when Fairfax was finally taken over by a consortium involving Mr Black. At that stage, you had two foreign bidders who wanted to enter into the arena in Australia in a bid to take over Fairfax. You had a local bid&mdash;Australian Independent Newspapers&mdash;who did not have to go through the Foreign Investment Review Board. So they, without any foreign competition, would have had no problem whatsoever in acquiring Fairfax. We have to remember that there was a stake here of some $1.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what the Foreign Investment Review Board did was to allow in the challenge by Conrad Black. So it was that a foreign player was able to enter into the domestic market, to then compete with a domestic bidder and thereby take over the Fairfax empire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the inquiry, it came to light that there was a Foreign Investment Review Board minute, dated 5 December 1991, which was quite derogatory of the local bidder. It was quite derogatory of AIN in that it said that that consortium did not have much financial backing and really did not have much experience in newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that was quite the reverse, and that what happened was that AIN was judged in its absence. So it was that the Foreign Investment Review Board deliberated, or caused the matter to be deliberated, on quite false foundations. Therefore, I am amazed to see that in the government response it says that the committee failed to recognise that, as an Australian entity, AIN was not an applicant for foreign investment approval. Well, of course it was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what the Foreign Investment Review Board was doing, on this false basis and on the advice it gave to the Treasurer, was letting in a foreign player. The government said, `Accordingly, that information was not of any consequence in determining the "contrary to national interest" test in respect of the two foreign investment proposals.' It was relevant. It was put to the board and to the Treasurer in the absence of AIN having any chance to contest that. So I put to the Senate that there is indeed a major flaw in any process which allows that to happen and which resulted in one of the biggest foreign takeovers in this country's history. So the government has done really nothing to address that. That is the second point which has been overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the one finding which related to the committee's finding that Mr Willis, the Treasurer, acted contrary to the public interest in not assisting the parliamentary inquiry by directing his officials not to attend and not to provide evidence. The government says that this behaviour is consistent with established principles relating to the provision of confidential advice to the government. The government said that it was in the public interest for these officials not to give that evidence to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this raised head on was the question: how much should a Senate committee be told? If one is to take any notice of the government response, not much. Senate committees go about very important tasks. Senate committees represent the Senate and the people of Australia. So when they conduct their inquiries, they do not expect to run up against stonewalls, especially not stonewalls from the government of the day. The Treasurer actively obstructed the proper inquiry of that committee. As a result of that committee's operations, there was careful consideration as to the whole question of how Senate committees should operate and how the government of the day should comply with their requests for information and evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government here takes no note of that. Nothing has been done by the government to fix that problem either. We still have the unsatisfactory situation where the government of the day can thumb its nose at Senate committees, and indeed has done so since. That was another aspect of the print media report which the government simply failed to address. So when one looks at this response to the report by the committee, one finds that it is totally lacking in substance and does not do any justice at all to the report which was handed down by the committee. Finally, such a cavalier response by the government is an affront not only to the Senate committee system but also to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a few matters in the few minutes I have available to me in the adjournment debate tonight. Firstly, I want to note that yesterday the first person was charged under the new laws relating to child sex tours, and that person appeared in court. This is in relation to an alleged offence of an act of indecency on a child in the Philippines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is the first case under the child sex tourism act that was passed by this parliament last year under which Australians convicted of paedophile activities overseas could face up to 17 years in gaol. Obviously, there are some problems involved in this legislation relating to fairness and how effectively it could operate but it is a fact now that someone has been charged after something like 14 months. I think that all members of this parliament, who abhor this kind of paedophile activity, would be pleased to see that the legislation is being tested and that there is a charge under the legislation. This particular indecent act took place in the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted there was another report this week that an Australian Federal Police investigation team has returned from Cambodia with evidence linking Australians with paedophile activities in that country. The investigation is at a highly sensitive stage and is expected to be finished before the end of the year. I noted in passing that Cambodian authorities were saying you cannot just blame foreigners, like Australians, for all this paedophile activity. I think he is quoted as saying, `Many Cambodians themselves, including high ranking officials, are involved in paedophilia as well.' It is heartening to see that action is being taken against those Australians who go overseas to abuse young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad a matter is proceeding that I hope will resolve, one way or another, allegations that were made relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Allegations were made, I think it was by the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), in the other place that either former or present members of the staff of the department of foreign affairs had been involved in paedophilia in South-East Asia. As I recall, the secretary to the department said he had found no evidence following an investigation but that there were contrary views expressed about that. I think some of the aid organisations were expressing grave concern about the rumours and reports that, in particular, former officials may have been involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretary to the department said a couple of months ago that he had asked the AFP to make a full, rigorous and comprehensive investigation. He called on anyone who had any information to reveal any involvement in paedophile activities within the department. There is no doubt that there is a great need to clear the department of any suggestions of improper behaviour of any kind in South-East Asia. I hope that this current investigation does exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, it would be essential to ensure that there was no suggestion of favouritism or any other interference with the proper investigations of the AFP. Those Australians who are involved in paedophilia in Cambodia, as revealed by this present investigation, should feel the full consequences of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While talking about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;this is the only link it has with the next matter I want to raise&mdash;I must say that it is of major disappointment that Mr Peng has not been able to avoid an 18-year sentence despite the enormous efforts on his behalf particularly by Senator McMullan. It must be very galling for Senator McMullan, after all his hard work, to see that Mr Peng has received such a severe sentence. It is of concern that, despite the immense amount of high-level and determined activity by Senator McMullan and other government ministers and officials of the department, Mr Peng has received such a severe sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It brings to mind the fact that there has been a much lower level of involvement in the problems that Dr V. J. Flynn is having in India. I am not seeking the same outcome, but I would seek the same level of governmental involvement in the Flynn matter as has taken place in the Peng matter. I wonder why there is such a striking difference between the intensity of governmental activity on behalf of Mr Peng as opposed to Dr Flynn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that so far I have heard no governmental response to the fact that this week an Indian court refused to grant bail to Dr Flynn with one of the reasons being `the nationality of the petitioner'. In other words, one of the factors in the court's refusing to grant bail to Dr V. J. Flynn was the fact that he is not of Indian nationality; he is an Australian. That is the sort of racism that I find totally objectionable. I am particularly concerned that this government, on the face of it, has evinced no public concerns about this matter. I would think that is something the government should immediately respond to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not seek to intervene in judicial proceedings in another country unless there are specific reasons, particularly if an Australian is discriminated against on the basis of nationality in such proceedings. Here we have a clear instance&mdash;I have seen the judgment; I have a copy of the judgment&mdash;where it is shown that this court in India has  discriminated against an Australian, in that it has not granted bail on the basis of `the nationality of the petitioner'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is no longer a matter where the gentlemanly approach, if you like, that has proceeded under the direction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) is appropriate. When an Australian is denied proper human rights in another country on the basis of his nationality, it is a major disgrace. It is the sort of thing one would expect an ambassador to be called in to be lectured about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Australian government intervenes and expresses its serious concern about this kind of discrimination and does something positive to help Dr Flynn, who is 60, in bad health and has a strong case in defence of the allegations against him. I call on the government to take this matter as seriously as it took the Peng matter. I hope it can be more effective in getting a better result than it did in the Peng matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about an issue that I have spoken about before. Given that the industry is about to become a very topical issue, I think it is important to talk about it at this time. It is also important because today ABARE brought out its quarterly product statistics for the June quarter 1995. We can see from those statistics that our imports of forest products have increased by 14 per cent, to $3 billion for the 1994-95 year. Our trade balance is in deficit to the tune of nearly $2 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very important aspect of this issue is that the government has been working for some time on the development of a national forest policy statement. As part of that process, agreement has been reached with most states, if not all states, with regard to the deferred forest arrangements, which will see this government ultimately put in place the most comprehensive reserve system of forest types, probably in the world, for a country that has, and still maintains, a substantial amount of its tree cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very good thing to do and something which we should do. At the same time, and as part of the national forest policy statement process, we are working on the industry development side of the issue. I read out those trade imbalance figures because they highlight how important to this country the forest industry really is. I am concerned that if we do not take the right decisions at this time we will not change those figures. In fact, we may well see them increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have over a long period of time, some 14 years now, pursued the issue of industry restructuring. Not the restructuring where we see people lose their jobs, but rather the restructuring that turns the current industry into the better industry&mdash;into an industry that utilises in a far better way the resources it has available to it. One of the major and most topical issues that we hear about every year, and have heard about for many years, is the export of woodchips and woodchip licences. It is for that reason that I think it is important to say something at this time about the issue of the 1996 export woodchip licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Utilisation of a forest resource is one of the most critical issues that we can be confronted with. If you take account of the import problem that this country has and look at the opportunity around the Asian Pacific region, even if you look at the 22 Pacific Rim nations, it is clearly identified, and has been for some time, that the demand for timber is growing at a significant rate and yet the capacity to meet that demand is declining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by Economic Forestry Associates has identified&mdash;and this has never been refuted; it is supported in most quarters&mdash;that the requirement for timber and timber products of the 22 Pacific Rim nations will increase by 252 million cubic metres a year between now and the year 2001. That is a consumption rate by the year 2001 of 1.5 billion cubic metres of timber. The same author predicts that the deficit in supply over demand by 1996&mdash;which is just next year&mdash;will be 180 million cubic metres. By the year 2001 it will be 325 million cubic metres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that many of the countries in our region have a major problem with regard to their forest resource. Many of them are developing economies and many of them are poor countries. There is great pressure on them to actually utilise the natural resources that they have. It is my view that they are being exploited significantly. We have a responsibility to take action within our own industry to assist those countries. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) supports that because he has spoken about it on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quickly turn to my own state and address this question of utilisation. I have some photographs here of logs on railway carriages waiting to go to woodchip mills. They are logs that should never be going to a woodchip mill. There are a number of these photographs. These logs have been looked at by sawmills throughout the state and from interstate who have identified very clearly that those logs can be utilised. Indeed, many sawmillers in Tasmania have conducted trials that clearly show that the recovery of timber from many of these logs can be as high as 35 per cent. Much of that timber is of face grade quality and can be turned into very valuable timber product that we can not only utilise within our own nation but we can export to other countries. If we do not take the right decisions, as I said earlier, that will never happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people had been reading the papers they would know that the minister responsible for issuing woodchip licences recently wrote to the woodchip licence holders and the applicants and potential applicants advising them that there would be new requirements or additional requirements on woodchip export licences this year. It has been quite interesting to see the plethora of would-be downstream processing proposals that have emerged from the woodwork since 8 September. In my state two of the key licence holders&mdash;one of them is the biggest exporter in this country&mdash;did not do anything with regard to downstream processing until just before 25 September. They came out with a range of proposals to demonstrate their commitment to downstream processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was the secretary of the Timber Workers Union for some time; it later became the forest branch of the CFMEU. Over many years since 1983 I watched that company close down sawmills and totally remove its commitment to downstream processing. In fact, it fought against people who put up downstream processing proposals and used the advantage that it has through a woodchip licence to ensure that proposals for flitch recovery and recovery sawmills could not get off the ground. This has concerned me seriously. Moreover, just this year this company was found to be in breach of the terms and conditions that apply to licences. Contractors and other companies that work for it were found to be splitting sawlogs. This was ultimately recognised by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission. It was also found to have taken wood from the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a company that has been around for a long time, not a new player in the game. I wrote to the minister about that because I believe we have a responsibility to uphold the integrity of woodchip licences. I have urged the minister to take whatever action is necessary, because it is not appropriate that these companies be allowed to get away with that&mdash;particularly when there are other companies and sawmillers who will utilise that resource in a much better way. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise in the Senate tonight a saga which has been taking place for some time. It is in connection with an enterprise with which most members of parliament would be familiar: the King Island Dairy. I expect that most people who are familiar with this company and its products would think it is a desirable component of Australian commerce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start this story in the middle because it is quite a saga, as I said. Time does not permit me to do anything more than start in the middle and allow people to assess the situation as I continue. This concerns the Kirk family who were the owners of the King Island Dairy in 1986. On 25 November 1993, Mr Bill Kirk received a letter from the Australian Securities Commission asking him how did the new material that he had spoken of have any significance in the matter that he had raised with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 December 1993, Mr Kirk wrote to the Australian Securities Commission and, essentially, this is where the story takes shape so far as what I am saying tonight. In his letter to the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Kirk questioned the dealings of a company called Liberty Trial and its relationship with another company called Transequity. Transequity bought the King Island Dairy from the Tasmanian government in September 1986. Liberty Trial bought some more shares in Transequity at the same time as Transequity was buying the King Island Dairy. The extra shares were sold to Agricorp when that company made a takeover bid in 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kirk asks the Australian Securities Commission whether, given the coincidental timing of the share purchases with the sale of the diary, the ASC would as a matter of urgency audit the funds trail from the sales of those shares. On 9 December 1993, the day after Mr Kirk's letter, the regional commissioner of the ASC in Tasmania wrote back to Mr Kirk to say that they had considered the information and decided that no further inquiries were justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 March 1994&mdash;and those who are following this will understand that there was other correspondence which took place between then&mdash;the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions wrote a letter in which he said that he could not direct the Australian Securities Commission to inquire or to direct resources. But the story continues. There are many members of parliament who have been involved in this matter. Many members of parliament have taken different approaches, tried different angles and conducted various levels of correspondence. I would like to read to the Senate tonight one letter from the Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch, to Mr Kirk on 24 November 1994. It states as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Kirk</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to your letter of 16 August 1994 requesting Senator Zakharov's personal assistance through a Private Members's Bill to gain you the return of the King Island Dairy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the ASC has carefully considered all material presented by you on a number of occasions and has on each occasion concluded that there has been no breach of the Corporations Law to justify further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC is an independent statutory authority charged with the responsibility for the investigation of complaints of corporate misconduct and I am precluded by law from giving directions to the ASC on a particular matter. As the ASC has investigated this matter and decided that no further action is justified, I regret that it would be inappropriate for any further action to be taken, by a Private Member's Bill or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have forwarded a copy of this letter to Senator Zakharov for her information.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by Michael Lavarch. I notice that Minister Crowley is at the table. I continue this story by reading a letter that was addressed to Senator Crowley, also by Michael Lavarch as the Attorney-General. It is dated 20 December 1994 and it reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thank you for your letter of 5 October 1994 on behalf of Mr W J Kirk of Cheltenham, Victoria, regarding the appointment of a receiver and manager and subsequent sale of the King Island Dairy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kirk has requested your personal assistance through a Private Member's Bill in gaining the return of the Dairy to him. I am advised that the King Island Dairy was in Mr Kirk's ownership in 1986, when the enterprise suffered financial difficulties and was placed in receivership. In his correspondence to you Mr Kirk alleges that the receivers and managers of the property sold it at a vast undervaluation to a company called Transequity Ltd and also raises unspecified allegations concerning share transactions by a shareholder of Transequity Ltd. Mr Kirk states that the Australian Securities Commission (the ASC) `did not want to know and would not investigate'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long history of representations by Mr Kirk to various parliamentary and administrative bodies concerning the King Island Dairy and the possibility of its return to him. Mr Kirk has raised the same issues in previous correspondence to myself. I am advised that the ASC has made extensive inquiries into Mr Kirk's allegations and carefully examined all additional material and issues raised by him. The ASC concluded that there was no reason to suspect a breach of the Corporations Law so as to justify action by the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a concluding paragraph expressing similar things to those expressed in the previous letter. The point that I am raising tonight&mdash;and I know there have been many other parliamentarians involved in this&mdash;is to ask: what is this family to do? Who can and will investigate Mr Kirk's problem? Apparently, it is not the responsibility of the ASC. I suppose we all have to accept that. But what if we allow for a moment that his assertions may be true&mdash;that the receivers and managers of the King Island Dairy sold it at a vast undervaluation to Transequity and that a shareholder of Transequity in some way gained an advantage? What if this family has been the subject of a sophisticated sting? Who is supposed to investigate and restitute damage in such situations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is an important question for this parliament. I intend to pursue it to a resolution. I do not know what to do next. I know that many people here tonight have been troubled by this situation and have been attempting to find a resolution to it. I suggest that this parliament should not let this matter rest just because it may be that the wrong institution has been approached or just because it may be that the paper trail peters out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the question: what happens if it is true? What happens if the confusion that is apparent in who was supposed to do what has been a deliberate course of action taken by some people who have gained great financial advantage at the expense of others? They are the questions that I think are extremely important for this parliament and they are the questions that I will pursue in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The adjournment debate is frequently a time when people air grievances. I would like to take the opportunity to do something slightly different and that is to share with the Senate a story of great joy. It relates to an Australian citizen who has climbed to the very pinnacle of his art and his art is mantis kung-fu. The Australian citizen in question is Mr Henry Sue. Henry Sue is well known to me, as he is well known to many in the Chinese community in Brisbane. He has been practising kung-fu since, I believe, his teenage days. I shan't go into how long that is unless Henry gets embarrassed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Henry recently returned from Hong Kong. The reason he travelled to Hong Kong was simply this: Henry was admitted to the ninth degree of mantis kung-fu. There are only two other grandmasters anywhere in the world who have achieved that grade. They are both, I understand, in Hong Kong and one of those two is Henry Sue's grandmaster. Henry Sue is now the sole custodian of mantis kung-fu in Australia and one of only three ninth degree grandmasters in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a great achievement not just for Henry Sue but also for Australia. It is really very pleasing that a man from this country can go to the traditional home of this form of kung-fu and excel and, in fact, complete what would normally be years of study in kung-fu, tai chi and chi kung in a matter of months. Such was Henry Sue's dedication. Now he has come back and Henry has recognised that he has a responsibility to pass on all that he has learnt to the people who study kung-fu in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Henry said a couple of things to me at the dinner which welcomed him back in Brisbane which I believe are worth sharing. One of those things was that sometimes Australians are better at kung-fu than people who are born in China or in Hong Kong. He said to me, `It is very simple. We Chinese grow up with this. People who don't grow up with it have to work harder for it. What it does make them is very strong and it gives them the hunger, the desire, to succeed, and that is something very exciting.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Henry wants to do is to share that and to see more Australians become proficient at very high levels in kung-fu and to show that this country can do as well as Hong Kong or as well as China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I attended the welcome back ceremony for Henry Sue I must say that I have never seen such a warm welcome extended as I saw that night. Henry was met in the mall&mdash;he did not know the celebration was going to take place&mdash;by two Chinese lions who proceeded to dance for him and then was led by the lions down through the mall to the restaurant, along a street lined on both sides of the pavement with other masters, instructors and disciples of his kung-fu&mdash;all of them bowing as he went past&mdash;all the way up the stairs into the restaurant. It was a huge evening. Henry was absolutely ecstatic. He said he did not think anyone could surprise him. His wife had surprised him twice in two weeks and this was the second time. The first was when she flew over to congratulate him on having succeeded. I think that is a cause for great joy and great celebration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to congratulate Henry Sue on the wonderful achievement he has made for all of us because we are all the richer for what he has done. It has raised the profile of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to continue this subject of good news by saying that I attended the 60th birthday party the other day of Mr Peter Yeoh, who is a Malaysian born Australian citizen. For those who do not know, in the Chinese community the 60th birthday is a very special year because the Chinese calendar is divided up into 12 years and five elements. So when you get to your 60th year, you have done a whole cycle of 12 years through each of the five elements. And it is traditionally a time of rebirth almost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Peter, who had been ill earlier on this year, celebrated his 60th birthday. Why is this a reason of great joy? I will explain why. Peter Yeoh is one of the most generous benefactors in Brisbane to all manner of charities. He received the Courvoisier award for public benevolence a couple of years ago and Peter demonstrated that at his birthday the other week by making three very large donations: one to the Chinese Fraternity Association to help construct an old people's home&mdash;he said he hopes he does not have to go into it!; another one to the Mater Hospital; and another one to the Chinese-Australian Medical Research Foundation. This continues a pattern of giving in which Peter has been involved for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just hasten to add that Peter is just one of many very generous benefactors in the Chinese community who give freely of their time and their money to not just the Chinese community but the Australian community generally. We are all the richer in both monetary terms and in a spiritual sense from their giving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to say that the line-up of people for Peter Yeoh's birthday was truly impressive and was testimony to the great character of the fine upstanding man he is. Particularly impressive and a particular tribute is the fine family that he has produced, because all of them are wonderful people. And I thank his wife and his family very much for the opportunity to attend that birthday party. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very short time available to me, I want to note what I consider a very important contribution made to our society by a judge of the High Court of Australia, Sir Daryl Dawson. I was delighted to see that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper gave headlines to an address he gave recently to the 28th Australian legal convention at Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> says, perhaps a little ungenerously, that, `Sir Daryl Dawson said yesterday in an extraordinary attack on the federal government's competition policy for the industry', and talks about marketing forces in that industry. I want to refer to the phrase `extraordinary attack'. I did not think, on getting and reading his full speech, that it was an extraordinary attack. I thought it was a most proper way of putting the present situation of the legal profession in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article goes on to say, `Sir Daryl, a noted conservative on the High Court bench said', and so on. It may be that Sir Daryl Dawson is a noted conservative; I suppose that is a matter for judgment. But if he is, may I say he is a conservative in the most proper sense of that word, in the way that the expression `conservative' is used to indicate people of high moral principle, people dedicated to the service of others and people with the sorts of values that this society should have and who want to preserve them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the honour of knowing Sir Daryl Dawson. He is a person of the highest integrity and of great good sense.

Given the nature of the capital gains tax, the estimating process is complex, and the estimates are not particularly reliable. Estimating capital gains tax requires a combination of factors to be taken into account, eg. the holding period of assets, dispositions of realisations over time, real gains compared with nominal gains, and the distribution of pre and post 19 September 1985 holdings of assets. Given the unreliable nature and difficulty in obtaining such data it was decided to discontinue forecasting capital gains tax collections separately. Instead, capital gains tax collections are included in the estimates for company tax, superannuation funds tax and other individuals tax collections (the capital gains tax is formally inseparable from the income tax in any case).</PARA>
