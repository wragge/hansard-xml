In accordance with the normal courteous and fair manner in which you have conducted the office of President, today you would normally call me to ask a question. I understand that that will not be the case because you are going to implement a recommendation of the Procedure Committee relating to the apportionment of questions.</PARA></TALK.START>

Even taking into account the number of members of the government party and deducting the number of ministers and yourself&mdash;that is to say, all those eligible&mdash;the government party is very much overrepresented in the number of questions allocated to it. I do not want to debate the matter, nor would I be permitted to do so. </PARA>

I refer to the fact that, if a constituent, a member of the public, paid the Labor Party $20,000, then access to the Prime Minister might be sought on a one-on-one basis or a one-on-one consultation could be negotiated with a minister of choice and that person could also be recorded as sponsoring the relevant cabinet meeting&mdash;sort of naming rights for cabinet meetings; the `Alan Bond cabinet meeting'. When you sell the privilege of access to ministers for $20,000, don't you see why the people think you are arrogant and out of touch? Don't you see why 760,000 unemployed Australians become angry?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Very loudly, the minister seems to have avoided his responsibility. It may well be that no-one took up the offer of a one-on-one with him, but certainly the party publications advertise it and the agents of the party publish it&mdash;they head their brochure, `Federal cabinet sponsorship'. When in the history of this country has the government put out a brochure seeking payment on the basis of federal cabinet sponsorship? Never! Only one government! And with federal government sponsorship, your agents, behind whom you seek to duck, claim you get additionally, `one-on-one access to the Prime Minister to be sought' and, `one-on-one access to the ministers of choice to be negotiated'. In other words, you call on the public to pay you for what you are paid by the public to do. You sell your access to the public for fees of up to $20,000. Will you not now acknowledge that the public find that appalling? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

While overseas comparisons are difficult to make, it does point to possible risk aversion by the Australian funds towards actual venture/development capital investments.</PARA>
<PARA>What the Prime Minister has been referring to is a risk aversion culture in Australian superannuation funds to just this sector of the economy: venture and developmental capital, and the inability of the funds to be at all intelligent about balancing their portfolios with investments across their portfolio and with significant focus on venture and developmental capital.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I have never said that. The obligation on trustees is to get a maximum return. If the return by the experts is described as mediocre, then the funds can certainly do better. When other funds in other countries do better and they get a better return, isn't that an object lesson to Australian fund managers? Of course the obligation is to get maximum return; but a portfolio would be properly balanced if part of it had a focus on high risk, high return and if a small proportion of the funds were invested in high risk, high return investments. It would also unblock an area in the national economy, which would cause the economy to grow and create more jobs. I think that is axiomatic. It is a pity the Liberal Party does not understand commerce, business, superannuation or investment.

I actually think that it is far more likely, Senator Boswell, as I said yesterday, that it has come from the Torres Strait&mdash;that is, in Australia&mdash;and it has been there for some years. I told you that yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fruit fly was detected in the Torres Strait in 1993 on five islands. It was eradicated on two islands in 1994 but not on the three northern islands where eradication is impracticable. Have a listen why, Senator Boswell: because of the close proximity of those islands to infestations which are endemic, Senator Boswell, in Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea, where the fruit fly exists.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Correct. They actually fly across, Senator. However, the Queensland Department of Primary Industries carried out suppression activities on these three islands. AQIS and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries cooperated in the eradication program. Earlier this year the fruit fly was detected again on the same two islands&mdash;obviously without your knowledge, Senator Boswell&mdash;from which it was previously eradicated, and also on two others. A major eradication program is already under way. AQIS is contributing half of the cost of $100,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to what you have been saying about downgrading, I might add, Senator Boswell, that a restructuring of AQIS and downsizing of staff is something that the coalition has been calling for for years. I am happy at another time to produce the press statements in here where your primary industry shadow minister, John Anderson, says that, but just have a listen to what has actually happened, Senator Boswell, in your part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS has, in fact, been active in enhancing quarantine in the Torres Strait and northern Queensland for some years, including the introduction of survey and monitoring programs in the region and the top watch program, which has raised community awareness of quarantine issues, including fruit fly, to very high levels in the Torres Strait and northern peninsula communities. AQIS assisted inspectors on the larger islands at Bamaga on Cape York to inspect for movements of fruit fly product. AQIS has established an FM radio network across Cape York which broadcasts quarantine awareness messages as well as a weekly radio broadcast in the Torres Strait and a range of other public awareness initiatives. The principal regional airline servicing in the region, Sunstate and Flight West, issues ticket wallets with quarantine information printed on all pages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 12 AQIS staff located in the Torres Strait and at Bamaga, and there are a further five located in Cairns who have responsibility under the Northern Australia quarantine strategy for quarantine issues in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait. AQIS has also recently installed a detector dog team at Cairns airport to further improve quarantine surveillance of aircraft, including those that originate in the Torres Strait. It is public knowledge that AQIS has achieved substantial staffing reductions in recent years, Senator Boswell. I might add, as I have said this before publicly, that most of that is in the export services and in meat inspection&mdash;something that your party has, in fact, been calling for for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is: what happens now? As I said before, we already have Queensland fruit fly in Queensland. We already have protocols established for dealing with that for exports from Queensland. I am now initiating, in dialogue with the Queensland primary industries minister, what we will need to do to establish immediate research, if it is necessary to do this, to see whether those protocols and those treatments and fumigations that already deal with the two species of fruit fly that already exist in Queensland, Senator Boswell, are effective in terms of dealing with fruit fly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fruit fly is in the Torres Strait. I do not think the primary industry constituents in Australia would like this, but the way that Senator Boswell wants to deal with it is to close our borders. The most likely scenario for how the fruit fly got here is by light aircraft, by vehicle&mdash;because people go from Bamaga and come back to the mainland in vehicles&mdash;or in a yacht. With all the protection that can be introduced, Senator Boswell knows perfectly well that, without closing the borders, you cannot have such a no-risk policy&mdash;and even then it would not work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason for that is that this pest is endemic in Papua New Guinea. The reason that no eradication techniques were introduced onto the three northernmost islands on the Torres Strait is that it was considered useless. The fly can be carried there environmentally and naturally across those waters. That is probably the reason. The important thing to remember is that Malaysia has this fly and Malaysia exports successfully into countries like Japan because the right treatment is applied to the fruit. That is what we will do now. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us get a couple of things on the record about Senator Vanstone's question and about this government's position on taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the affection of the Australian people for us. What we promised to do at the last election was not to increase the overall burden of taxation and, as Senator Gareth Evans and I have said in this chamber many, many times&mdash;I do not have the figures to hand at the moment&mdash;nor have we. So that is a promise we have kept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As far as the l-a-w one is concerned, that has been kept, and it was kept in this last budget as well by bringing forward the first taxation cut and making that earlier for all taxpayers in Australia than promised at the election and by, of course, providing in the last budget a payment to superannuation to compensate for the second income tax instalment. So we can go through all of the erroneous elements that set the platform for this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me go back to what is seen to be the issue here. Our tax policy is out in the open and clear. It is laid down in the last budget and the budget before that. We are on the record about it. What is the outcome of our tax policies? If you can compare the level of taxation in Australia under us to the level of taxation when you had the Treasury bench and Mr Howard, your now leader, was Treasurer and responsible for taxation policy, the tax burden on Australians now is less by a large margin than what it was when you were in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the high taxing party of Australian politics is you, not us. We are the ones that have lowered the level of taxation in Australia. We have provided&mdash;I do not have the figure to hand&mdash;at least six cuts to income tax over the life of our period in government. So, on the record, who is the high taxing party? You, not us. The level of taxation was higher under you; it is lower under us. They are the clear messages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second point I make is that if you look at how Australia rates in the world, you would have reference to the OECD table of developed countries. That is our peer group of economies, all the developed countries in the world. We are the second lowest taxed economy in the OECD. We have only been displaced as the lowest by Turkey because Turkey re-evaluated its GDP upwards and thus lowered the percentage of the tax take from the overall economy.

If you did that to keep the states' income revenue raising in balance you would cut state government expenditure in this country by $25 billion a year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Chapman this day, relating to the Cut Price Deli franchise.</PARA>
<PARA>This has to be one of the more significant examples of Senator Schacht's incompetence as a minister, of which we have seen many over the last few years, whether it is in regard to space, Customs or whatever. Of course, the first issue perhaps precedes Minister Schacht, but certainly he now has to take responsibility for that decision. That was the appointment of Mr Rechichi to the federal government's franchising task force&mdash;a person convicted and sentenced to five years for armed robbery; a person appointed by Minister Beddall to that task force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht's response to this has been that he did not make the appointment and that the appointment was made on the basis of recommendations by the Franchisors Association of Australia and New Zealand. One might ask the minister whether, in his view, it is appropriate that such a person, whom I understand is about to declare bankruptcy, should ever have been in the position of advising the government on issues involving the commitment of franchisees' funds, irrespective of the source of the recommendation of his appointment. Surely these people are vetted and their bona fides properly established before any recommendation for appointment is accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter dated 8 March 1995, following a meeting between Senator Schacht's adviser and three of the Cut Price Deli's franchisees, Senator Schacht advised that the material provided to his office had been forwarded to the Trade Practices Commission for assessment of alleged breaches of the Trade Practices Act. Yet on an SBS program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Insight</EMPHASIS>, which went to air on 19 October 1995 as I mentioned in my question, the interviewer stated that Senator Schacht admitted that he did not know the details of the Cut Price Deli case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 April 1995, Senator Schacht again wrote to the same franchisee shrugging off any responsibility&mdash;this time to the Trade Practices Commission under Mr Robert Gardini, the person appointed responsible for undertaking a review of the franchising code of practice.

He wrote the next one on 8 August 1995 to the same franchisee about the Cut Price Deli franchise situation concerned unconscionable conduct. He clearly did have the details of the Cut Price Deli situation as is evidenced by that letter which he wrote. One might be tempted to say: it was only when the answer he gave to the SBS journalist was found to be so inaccurate that he then took cover under the sub judice umbrella with this comment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm very loathe to make personal comment because these are legal matters between a franchisee and franchisors.</PARA>
<PARA>He made some reference to those legal matters again in his answer this afternoon. But that does not negate or obviate the fact that the minister said that he was not aware of the details, when clearly the letters that he has written to the franchisees show that he was very much aware of those details. It is a matter of public record. On 7 September 1995, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> published an article by Anne Lampe, in which it is stated that following the appointment of the voluntary administrator to the Cut Price Deli group which `left more than 100 franchisees in limbo', the Australian Franchisees Association wrote to Senator Schacht seeking government action for its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That article was published, despite an attempt to prevent its publication and threatened defamation action lodged by Mr Rechichi on 23 June in the Supreme Court. Six weeks earlier, one of the franchisees won damages and costs of $260,000 against the Cut Price Deli group but, of this, the franchisee will receive only five to 10 cents in the dollar due to the fact that an administrator had been appointed prior to his receiving damages. I understand the ASC is now considering an investigation of the affairs of Cut Price Deli and of the voluntary administrator, Mr John Starr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should have demonstrated more concern on this issue but he has washed his hands of the issue of how a franchisee's letter marked commercial-in-confidence to Minister Beddall could have mysteriously turned up in Mr Rechichi's hands. He has also washed his hands of Mr Rechichi's appointment despite conviction. He has clearly washed his hands of all of the concerns of these franchisees and the way in which they have been treated by Mr Rechichi and the other directors of the Cut Price Deli group by simply fobbing these matters off to the Trade Practices Commission, when it seems very clear that any actions of the Trade Practices Commission would be quite inadequate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue that Senator Chapman is getting himself into a lather over has been around for quite a considerable time. There is nothing inconsistent with what I said on SBS about the details of Cut Price Deli. If I recollect the interview correctly, I was asked about the details.

That is matter for the Trade Practices Commission as a statutory authority to make a judgment about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have to say, Senator Chapman, that that issue and many others I had been observing in the franchising industry led me to bring forward to early in 1994 the promised review, chaired by Bob Gardini, to deal with a number of these issues that people such as the Cut Price Deli franchisees were raising, issues about the transparency of the commercial arrangements they entered into when they signed a contract to be a franchisee. I had said almost from that time, `I want a system voluntarily entered into from both sides where there is full disclosure of all the arrangements and people don't change the rules afterwards.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations from Bob Gardini were specific and the government has responded to them.

But, no, there is a deafening silence. Why? I suspect it is because the Liberal Party under the guidance of Mr Costello and the business establishment in Melbourne want to ensure they line up with big business. They forget about small business. When it counts to amend the law to make big business give small business a better opportunity, you mob opposite are always found wanting. You will not vote for it.

There are other things, like a lack of a business ability, which accounts for 20 per cent, and economic conditions, which are brought upon by the government and which account for 30 per cent of these things failing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point is that we are not going to direct it. But there is a need in this area. The report that I drew the Senate's attention to in question time was a report commissioned by the National Investment Council, which is an advisory body to the federal government on investment. It sought to find out what operates in this area of the market. It commissioned a consultancy to go away and make the report. The words in the report are the words of the consultancy; they are not the words of the government. We have not written them; the consultants, after surveying the field, wrote them. What did the consultants say? I do not have the document in front of me, but I do recall the quote quite well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said that superannuation funds&mdash;and they named the funds&mdash;demonstrate elements of risk aversion when it comes to investment in small- to medium-sized companies. They said that, on the performance of those funds, they are 35 per cent more risk averse than similar funds in the United States and the United Kingdom&mdash;two economies with which we compare ourselves to see how well we are performing. There may be a series of behavioural reasons as to why that is the case; I can think of some that fall into that category. We have heard nothing from the opposition about trying to analyse the policy implications of this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not have a policy; that is exactly right. What we have heard is a lot of blather. One of the possible policy reasons could be that superannuation funds under this government have exploded in size and number. The reason they have is that this government has introduced superannuation so that all workers in Australia get it. You will recall that, previously, white collar workers, senior executives or public sector employees might have had superannuation. But if you did not fall into that category, you did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most workers in this country regarded superannuation as a privilege of their boss or the Public Service and not for them. That was an inequity. We have remedied it, and now everyone in Australia who works for a living is entitled to superannuation cover and to look forward to a dignified retirement because of that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the explosion in the volume and number of funds, there are a number of people, new to the task and lacking in experience, managing investment decisions in those funds. We have done a number of things to help them gain experience. But the funds still seem to be impervious to what assessment of risk is in small- to medium-sized businesses and to balancing their portfolio of investment to develop some funds in this area. The Prime Minister is concerned to point that out. It means that companies like Pacific Dunlop are bought by foreigners, not Australians, when they are put on the Stock Exchange for sale. They are bought by foreigners because they better understand the risk of these sorts of investments. Australians with the money to invest in keeping those companies under Australian ownership have been negligent in not devoting themselves to understanding that risk. That is the point of the issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for reaffirming that you stand by it and putting it on the public record. I want to make a very brief point about that. Until this government was elected in 1983, less than 40 per cent of working people in this country had superannuation. The vast majority of people had to depend on the traditional age pension&mdash;at the present time about $8,300 a year. People who took out superannuation were, as Senator Cook has described, people who were in the Public Service, where there was and still is a very generous scheme, with very significant contributions from government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also personal private superannuation that was offered. But the difficulty was, Senator, it was prefaced&mdash;it has changed now significantly&mdash;on a scheme of tax deductibility and tax concessions. If you look at the way in which those tax concessions operate, it is generally only higher income earners who can take advantage of some of those tax concessions. In fact, what we had was a situation where, with a significant subsidy from the government&mdash;I am not saying that necessarily was wrong&mdash;only people generally on a higher income could take advantage of it. You may well have been one of those, Senator Panizza. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until 1983, hundreds of thousands of people&mdash;probably at least a million people&mdash;who had their own personal superannuation had taken it out as a result of the tax concessions. They tended to be male. They tended to be higher income earners, they were in a public service fund or they were senior management in corporations. The poor worker, who would be earning less than $35,000 a year&mdash;in many cases much less than that&mdash;did not have access because employers often did not offer their superannuation funds to their employees. So they had to go and take personal superannuation out, if they had the disposable consumer income available to go and buy that superannuation product. Higher income earners generally have that and not lower income earners. That is the point I want to make, Senator Panizza. It is not a point I am going to repeat in my next contribution. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Vanstone this day, relating to taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook claimed to the Senate and to the Australian community this afternoon that this government is a low taxing government. He made comparisons with the OECD and left the clear impression that the government is a low taxing government and that we should judge what it is going to do in the future by what it has done in the past. Those policies are set out in the budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me set the facts of the last few years before the Senate and the Australian community. Since Paul Keating has been Prime Minister, in the first full year of his reign as Prime Minister, 1992-93, the total taxes and charges by this government from the community totalled $95 billion. This year, 1995-96, the total of taxes and charges is $125 billion&mdash;a 31 per cent increase over a three-year period. Big spending, big taxing government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this big, huge increase in taxes and charges over a three-year period, at the start of that period, the 1992-93 financial year, the debt by the Commonwealth was $30 billion. Today it is over $90 billion and, at the end of this financial year, the budget papers and government announcements indicate it will be very close to $100 billion. Not only have they taken in this huge increase in taxes and charges, but they have also borrowed another $70 billion and spent that too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is worse than that. They have sold off some of the silver&mdash;Qantas, half of the Commonwealth Bank, CSL, et cetera. If we go back to the same starting point, 1992-93, at least $5 billion of the silver owned by the community has been sold off, and they have spent that too. And worse than that again, going back to the same starting point, back at the start of the 1992-93 financial year, the Commonwealth spent about 4.7 per cent of its outlays on infrastructure&mdash;that is, investments in the community. Back in Mr Hawke's day it was nearly eight per cent but, since Mr Keating has been Prime Minister, it has gone to less than five per cent. What is it this current financial year that we are over a quarter of the way through? I dare you to guess. It is minus 2.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this big-spending, big-taxing government claiming we should look to their policies for the future by looking at what they have done in the past. I say to the Australian community, just look at what they have done in the past three years. We cannot afford to go on like this. Anyone who runs a household understands that not only can you not increase charges in the manner they have, but to borrow and spend that and to then sell off part of the farm and spend that too, and then to stop investing in infrastructure, is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the statement made by the President earlier today relating to question time.</PARA>
<PARA>The basic issue the President was asked to comment on today by Senator Harradine was a decision that was presumably supported by the Procedure Committee regarding question allocation being reduced for the WA Greens, the Independents and the Australian Democrats. In the case of Independent senators, it is to be reduced from one question every three days to one question every four days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion this is a very unfair decision which undermines the role of question time. We had a process for resolving this issue. It started well but it has gone astray. I would like to raise those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition raised the issue of question allocation. We accept that there is a basis for the opposition's concerns. We have attempted to engage in constructive dialogue to solve the problem and it is unfortunate that the final decision has now been made without the involvement of the Greens and the Independents. We believe that we are being gagged and that the role of question time is being undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the prerogative of the President to set the allocation of questions. The current system has operated during the term of this parliament and for as long as I have been in this chamber. Initially, the President attempted to answer the concerns of the opposition through negotiations between all parties. This was very productive to begin with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree that there is a need for a constructive approach which affirms the role of question time and also accommodates the opposition's concerns. However, what has happened is that it has degenerated into a private deal between the parties, using the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure for cover. The Greens and the Independents are not represented on this committee. We would like to have some representation. I understand that the government and the opposition are willing to allow us on to the committee, but that does not deal with the issue before us now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Procedure Committee met last week and supported the decision that has been made and that was going to be enforced by the President from today. An attempt has been made to establish a principle of proportionality for question allocation. As Senator Harradine has said, no such principle has existed previously. We are also supported by the Clerk of the Senate in that assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the purpose of question time? It is a forum for the accountability of the executive. The allocation of questions should be fair, but with regard to the purpose. The purpose is ministerial accountability. Therefore ministers and the President should be excluded from any proportional formula that might be used to ensure fairness. Just work out what will happen if, with the change being brought about for the last 16 days of this sitting, there is a change of government. The government, in the form of the coalition, will have enormous advantages in relation to dorothy dixers. The whole principle of proportionality will, instead of ensuring fairness, overrule what I believe is a higher principle of accountability of ministers. It is the opportunity that ministers have to give an account of themselves to the people via the parliament and via the questions put forward by opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the coalition were in government it would be favoured because of its proportional representation and that would violate the principle of accountability of the executive&mdash;to the detriment of both the government and the opposition. While it is generally held in this place that each senator should be treated equally, this is nonsensical, given the clear distinctions between government and non-government senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are willing to come to an alternative arrangement which accommodates the opposition's desire for a greater number of questions, but not at the expense of existing allocations to individual senators. We should work forwards and not backwards. No-one should be disadvantaged. We should work for a win-win situation. Along these lines, we suggested to the President that there should be a set allocation of 18 questions per day, removing the overall time limit, and reducing the answer time limit from four minutes to three minutes. This allocation of questions would be based on the current system and be expanded along proportional lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of time limits is an incentive for the government to answer questions as efficiently as possible to ensure the containment of question time in the daily program, while allowing for longer answers where necessary. This allocation will better reflect question time as a forum for scrutiny of the executive. Any change to the system should obviously be for a trial period. This was the proposal that I wanted to put before the Procedure Committee, but I was unable to do that because we were not represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role and processes of this place should not be compromised by party interests. Deals should not be done behind closed doors and the vital role of question time should not be diminished. The legitimate voices of the Greens and Independents should not be silenced. This should definitely not be happening in the dying days of the session before we go to an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I ask the President to reconsider his decision and again engage in dialogue between all parties.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your letter you state that:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">questions. In doing so we recognise that a precedent, while not existing previously, will be established. As such, we are willing to consider any proposal which uses the current system as the minimum bench mark for the allocation of questions and expands from that point, not contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are to use a system based on representation then its logical conclusion is to exclude Government Ministers and yourself from any calculation and, arguably, all Government  Senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An initial suggestion would be to establish a question time of a set allocation per day, removing the overall time limit. The following allocation is suggested: Government 5; Coalition 10; Democrats 2; Greens (WA) and Independent Senators each guaranteed one question every three days. This would roughly mean 18 questions per day, depending on the call of Greens and independent Senators to ensure their allocation. Any change to question time should be for a trial period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These figures are based on the current representation of the Senate, excluding Ministers and the President (see the attached table). The removal of the time limit is an incentive for the Government to answer questions as efficiently as possible to ensure the containment of question time in the daily program, while allowing for longer answers where necessary. This allocation better reflects question time as a forum for scrutiny of the executive. The ability of Government backbenchers to contribute to such scrutiny is preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens (WA) look forward to further debate on this issue.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Chamarette</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALLOCATION OF QUESTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this letter is to invite senators to express views on the allocation between the parties and independent senators of questions at question time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In principle the distribution of the call during question time should be in proportion to the numbers in the Senate of the various parties, groups and independent senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have continued the practice of my predecessor of giving the Australian Democrats two questions per day and sharing one question per day between the Greens (WA) and the independent senators as a practical means of applying that principle. However, a fixed number of questions for these groups, combined with a fluctuating total number of questions, particularly with the increasing use of supplementary questions over which I have no control, is producing a less proportional result, which has tended to favour the minor parties and independents. The attached figures show that the Democrats' and Independents' share of questions has increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have accepted that some variation from precise proportionality is unavoidable but have also accepted that if that variation becomes excessive then some action would have to be taken to bring the distribution of questions back towards proportionality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suggested the following solution. The Greens (WA) share of questions would be reduced to two questions every four days and the Democrats would receive one question per day plus a second question after thirteen questions had been asked on any one day. Where this total was not reached on four consecutive days the Democrats would receive a second question on the fourth day. Using the figures for the call for the first half of 1995, these proposals would still have produced an outcome slightly favourable to the Democrats and the Greens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a meeting of all party whips and representatives of the Greens on Thursday 24 August 1995 it was clear that the underlying assumption&mdash;that questions should be distributed approximately in proportion to membership of the Senate&mdash;was not universally accepted. Various proposals to change question time were canvassed, for example, a fixed number of questions, for time to be added to question time to compensate for points of order or other interruptions and exclusion of ministers from the calculation of the government party's share of membership of the Senate. These matters were clearly beyond the competence of the meeting to resolve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had hoped that my proposal to adjust the share of questions would be accepted and that proposals for fundamental change to question time would be referred to the Procedure Committee. However I, understand that this is not generally acceptable. I have therefore returned to the established practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These matters will be further considered by the Procedure Committee. I invite senators to put any views in writing addressed to me.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DISTRIBUTION OF QUESTIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since becoming President I have sought to apply the principle that the distribution of the `call' during Question Time should approximate the proportion of membership of the Senate of the various parties, groups and independent Senators. I have continued the practice of my predecessor of giving the Australian Democrats two questions and sharing one question per day between the Greens (WA) and the independent senators as a practical means of applying that principle. However a fixed number of questions for these two parties combined with a fluctuating total number of questions, particularly with the increasing use of supplementary questions over which I have no control, is producing increasingly skewed outcomes. This has tended to favour the minor parties and independents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have accepted that some variation from precise proportionality is unavoidable but have also accepted that if that variation became excessive then some action would have to be taken to bring the distribution of questions back towards approximate equity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figures for the first half of this year which I obtained from the Table Office during the recess showed that the Democrats and Independents share of questions had increased compared with 1994. Thus my office approached the Australian Democrats and Greens in the last week of the recess with proposals to reduce their shares of the `call'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals were an arithmetic solution to an arithmetic problem. The Greens(WA) share of questions would be reduced to two questions every four days and the Democrats would receive one question per day plus a second question after thirteen questions had been asked on any one day. Where this total was not reached on four consecutive days the Democrats would receive a second question on the fourth day. Using the figures for the `call' for the first half of 1995 these proposals would still have produced an outcome slightly favourable to the Democrats and the Greens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I convened a meeting of all party whips plus representatives of the Greens to discuss this</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">issue on Thursday 24 August 1995. It was clear at that meeting that the underlying assumption&mdash;that questions should be distributed approximately according to the proportions of membership of the Senate&mdash;was not universally accepted.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had hoped that my proposal to adjust the share of questions would be accepted and that proposals for fundamental change to Question Time would be referred to the Senate's Procedure Committee. However I understand that this is not acceptable to the Greens (WA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus I invite you to discuss this with your Senate colleagues and advise me of an agreed approach to the allocation of the call in Question Time which I can implement. In the interim I will continue to follow established practice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Margetts,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Questions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The distribution of questions in the Senate does not fully reflect the party affiliations of members At a meeting on 29 March 1995 various matters in relation to the distribution of the `call' during Question Time were considered by the party whips and a representative of independent senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was clear at that meeting that there was no general agreement on the basis on which questions should be distributed. Some of those present felt that the government party did not need access to a share of questions proportional to its membership of the Senate because it had so many other opportunities to get its views on the record. It was also stated that, as the Democrats and minor parties did not get involved in the disruptive behaviour which occasionally reduces the number of questions asked, they should not suffer by having fewer opportunities to ask questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second issue&mdash;the weight to be given to supplementary questions in determining the share of questions&mdash;also needs to be resolved. At present a supplementary question is counted as equal to an initial question. It was suggested that, because the time available for a supplementary is half that for a full question they should be valued accordingly. In practice this makes very little difference to the overall imbalance. The proportions vary slightly but the same balance is maintained. It increases the overall share of those who ask fewer supplementaries&mdash;the government and the Democrats&mdash;and reduces the rest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I propose to invite the whips of the parties and representatives of the independent Senators to a further meeting before the commencement of the next session to seek to resolve three issues:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the distribution of questions should conform as closely as is possible to the party affiliations of members of the Senate;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">how supplementary questions should be counted; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">depending on the decisions taken with regard to the first two points, what formula should be adopted to govern the distribution of questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will ask the table office to provide me with a breakdown of questions asked in the first half of this year and circulate alternative proposals for the allocation of questions based on various assumptions; for example using questions only; using both questions and supplementaries and using both but valuing supplementaries at half the value of an initial question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of how the President calls senators during question time has been the subject of a considerable amount of discussion both in the Procedure Committee and informally amongst senators in the chamber. I believe the President has attempted to be fair and impartial in the way that he has dealt with this difficult issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept a number of the comments that Senator Chamarette made. I suppose we could say that any of the Senate's committees operate behind closed doors. It is true to a certain extent that the Procedure Committee does operate behind closed doors, but it presents a report to the Senate that anyone who is interested in its deliberations can read. It can also be debated in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette has certainly raised on a number of occasions the issue that the Western Australian Greens are not represented on the Procedure Committee and hence she is unable to put a point of view to the Procedure Committee members at those meetings. There is obviously some truth in that. It is true that neither Senator Chamarette nor Senator Margetts are members of the Procedure Committee, but I can assure them that the committee has looked at this issue in some detail at a number of meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is an argument for a further discussion to be held, perhaps outside the forum of the Procedure Committee, given the matter raised by Senator Harradine in question time today relating to his concerns about the President's calling of senators during question time, given some of the matters that have been raised by Senator Chamarette and also given that the Australian Democrats, the opposition and the government hold some strong views in relation to this matter. It seems to me that before we progress this matter in the chamber it would be appropriate to have another discussion. As the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I am willing to convene an informal meeting to see whether we can work through some of these issues before we deal with the Procedure Committee report in a more formal way and before this matter is finalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do suspect that if we get into a debate now about this particular issue it will go for a long time. It is always difficult to solve these sorts of issues in the chamber. In the interests of trying to find a solution that is agreeable to all senators and all parties in the Senate, and also in the interests of trying to save a little of the chamber's valuable time, I am willing to convene such a meeting and see if we can work through some of these issues. Obviously, then it is a matter for discussion at a later stage in the chamber or at the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that senators would see this as a sensible proposal. I hope that senators would accept this in the spirit that I make the suggestion. I hope also that it means that we will be able to curtail this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Through you, Madam Deputy President, I would say to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) that it is a pity we did not talk long enough and get it right before we embarked upon this new process. It is really regrettable that we have to meet again. We all know the principles that we have espoused that are important to us. We have raised them already in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a representative on the Procedure Committee. Her report to the party room suggested to us that there was not much interest in pursuing our concerns about the fundamental assumptions that we wanted to question. I put those fundamental assumptions again because this new procedure, as I understand it, overturns about 17 years of convention. We should ask the question: why is that happening now? It is happening because the opposition made a complaint to the President. Obviously it is his responsibility to respond to that complaint. Why is this happening now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senate, because of its proportional representation, actually has one of the strengths of our parliamentary processes&mdash;that is, it reflects diversity. We should continue to question one of the assumptions that underpins this new procedure: the assumption that the allocation of questions is made on a collective basis. Where is the starting point for the fact that somehow questions have to be allocated to parties on a collective basis and then the others get a look in after that? We are elected as individual senators for our states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I think it is silly to count ministers, who can ask questions&mdash;and maybe they would like to start asking each other questions&mdash;in the total of those who are able to ask questions, unless they want to do it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a gerrymander, Senator Ray. The other thing I raised before was the way in which we count supplementary questions. Both the assumptions and the statistics on which this new process have been based are misleading and faulty. I have talked about the assumptions, but the statistics are faulty. The President sent around a series of statistics allegedly showing us how some people were getting an advantage based on proportionality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been very hard to get the major parties to listen to the argument on what a supplementary question counts for. It is counted in various ways in various statistics. It should be included in the total. If the President does not know in advance who is going to ask a supplementary question, he can always even it out afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the real problem here is that we have a conflict of principles. We have the proportionality, but then we have the dubious assumptions and the faulty statistics on which we are basing a new process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that the two major parties have voted together to implement this new procedure which, I think, is a primitive, blunt and inequitable attempt to solve what in some ways can be seen as a legitimate complaint from the opposition.

I understand that. I often think that some of the individually inspired questions that come from our side just lack a touch in subtlety. Especially, sitting out front, I have actually noticed that. Therefore, I do not think it is the end of the world to us even if we do not consider proportionality, but have what we might call a fair mix of questions that actually meets the requirement of the Senate to bring the executive to be accountable to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Senator Kernot said beforehand that there was a problem in that not all the representatives but some representatives of Labor and Liberal were not particularly interested in our points of view. I think it is probably correct to say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still believe that question time can work more reasonably. I would like to put on the record now, too, a conversation that I had with one of the President's staff who is dealing with this&mdash;and I hope this is what the President intends to do. I was told that, to ensure absolute correct proportionality, the President would work to his ruling that he set down in his letter for what I believe is a two-week period, one sitting period, and then he would work out how fair the proportionality had been out of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, with 9.6 per cent of senators, if the Democrats only got seven per cent of questions, for instance, we would get an extra 2.6 per cent of questions, or an attempt to do that, over the next sitting fortnight. So over a session, or even over two sitting fortnights, it would even out to as close as the President could get to exact proportionality. I hope that will still happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I am sure Senator Kernot has made, but I will make it again, is that we still believe that questions should be on a basis of need and that basis of need does not include ministers. I cannot see why ministers need to ask questions of other ministers. I have not noticed them doing it. I know they have a right to, but I have not noticed them doing it. I do not expect them to start tomorrow; I do not expect them to start at all. So I still do not believe that, on a basis of need, ministers need to ask questions of other ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe taking note, which Senator Ian Macdonald brought into this, has been a part of negotiations. While it is an interesting point which we perhaps should be looking at, it is certainly not one that we have looked at in the past and it is not one that has taken up an awful lot of time. I well remember the first time that I think Senator O'Chee got up and sought leave to take note of a minister's answer and everybody sat around looking like stuffed chickens and wondering what on earth was going on. It was an extremely clever move of Senator O'Chee's which has since then well and truly taken off. It is a very, I think, reasonable and valuable thing to do. Certainly that is a part where the Democrats believe we should have well and truly our amount of taking note. We are a bit under, but we get around about our fair share of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, while proportionality is reasonable, need is also something that should be taken into account.

For example, to count a supplementary as a question is clearly flawed. It takes two-sevenths of the total question time. A primary question takes five-sevenths of that time. To base any statistics on the assumption that a supplementary is equal to a question will give you a pretty stupid assessment of proportionality. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane suggested that we should give this system a chance to work.

If that open-ended timing is not agreed to, the only equitable solution is to transfer this whole entitlement and extend the time from four days to the time that it would actually take for each senator to have the opportunity to ask a question before the next senator asked a question. To me, that would also bring into it the question of whether supplementaries ought to be counted at all, whether they are optional or not.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 28 August 1995 concerning the formulation of Approved Occupational Clothing Guidelines under subsection 51AL(7) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have noted the Committee's views in relation to a numbering system for future instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As regards the issue of the impact of the date the Guidelines were expressed to take effect (7 June 1995) being different from the date of notification in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> (21 June 1995), I wish to point out that the new Guidelines were formulated to take account of concerns from employers and uniform suppliers that some aspects of the original Guidelines were difficult to comply with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Guidelines contain a number of revisions that will in fact make it easier for genuine corporate uniforms or wardrobes to be admitted to the Register of Approved Occupational Clothing (`the Register') and hence gain tax deductibility. For instance, the maximum number of colours or shades that can be used in a design has been increased from four to eight; the minimum size of corporate identifiers on accessories has been reduced; and there is greater flexibility for differing uniforms where the employer maintains separate public identities for different parts of its organisation or where uniforms differ between employees for safety reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also note that while the new Guidelines state (at Clause 23) that single items of occupational clothing, other than full body garments, will not be admitted to the Register, this simply serves to clarify the effect of Clause 10 of the original Guidelines, which stated that occupational clothing `. . . must, when considered as a set, distinctively identify the wearer as a person associated, directly or indirectly, with their employer. . . '.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Single items of occupational clothing, being worn in conjunction with conventional clothing, have never been considered to pass this test and were therefore not approved under the original Guidelines. On this basis, I have been advised that the inclusion of Clause 23 in the new Guidelines will have no effect on the eligibility or otherwise of applications for admission to the Register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, however, one very minor area where the new Guidelines could be seen as being stricter than the original ones. This is in relation to the definition of `stand alone' corporate identifiers. The new Guidelines state that a stand alone identifier must be permanently affixed by being, inter alia, `sewn down on all sides', while the original Guidelines stated that such identifiers must be permanently affixed by being `sewn on'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I have been advised that this difference has not, in practice, adversely affected the rights of any applicant seeking admission to the Register. This is because the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority (TCFDA)&mdash;which administers the Guidelines&mdash;did not reject any applications dated between 7 June and 21 June 1995 which would have satisfied the original Guidelines but not the new ones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, I have been advised by the Attorney-General's Department that, as a matter of legal interpretation, the Guidelines actually commenced on the day they were published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. This is because the paragraph in the published text of the Guidelines (paragraph 3) which states that they commence on 7 June 1995, is expressed to be explanatory only, and thus is not part of the Guidelines proper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, it appears that the original Guidelines effectively continued to operate until 21 June, both from a technical legal perspective and in practice. For any applications dated and approved by the TCFDA between 7 June and 21 June on the basis of the new Guidelines but which would have failed the original Guidelines, tax deductibility has been (and will continue to be) available from the dates the applications were approved and the clothing designs entered on the Register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of the above information, I have been advised that the difference between the date the new Guidelines were expressed to take effect and the date of notification in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> has had no prejudicial impact upon the rights of, or imposed any liabilities on, any person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust this information will be of assistance to your Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important motion, and I hope that the Senate will treat it with the importance it deserves. It is quite extraordinary to try to understand what has motivated people like Bill Kelty to intervene in the current Coles-Myer debate. I would have thought that it is apparent to all outsiders that the institutions are responding to widespread concerns in the community, particularly in relation to related party transactions and the combination of the role of chairman and executive officer. In those circumstances, it seems to me that it is perfectly proper for the institutions to seek to bring about higher standards of corporate governance. There have been various investment management groups who have been arguing vehemently that there needs to be a change in those arrangements, so why did Mr Kelty intervene?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did not take issue on the merits. He did not, for example, argue that related party transactions should be of no concern to shareholders, nor did he argue that the arrangements currently in place are adequate, nor did he seek to justify the concept of an executive chairman. He simply weighed in with a series of questions clearly designed to intimidate the AMP, to make it at least think twice and, preferably, to back off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be asked: whose interest was he serving? Was he hoping to set up a golden parachute for himself as his use-by date rapidly approaches, or was he hoping to again persuade some of the major corporate operators and close friends of his to kick the ALP tin in a big way with the approach of the election? He was clearly pleading the case for the incumbents on the Coles-Myer board. He was not interested in quality of management issues. He was simply protecting his mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think it is very understandable that there are many within the union movement who would view this development with great concern. Again, one asks: why is it that Bill Kelty has strayed so far from his roots? Perhaps it is because he looks at someone like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and he sees a bloke who has never had a real job in his life; who has been in parliament since he was 25 years of age; who in that time has had a wife and four kids to support; who has been able to not only buy a half-million dollar home in Elizabeth Bay but has had it unoccupied for some years&mdash;in other words, forgoing very substantial rental income; and who has then been able to come up with $400,000 to put on the table&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is a very interesting proposition. Mr Kelty realises that he is in a mug's game, and he does not want to be on welfare street when the music stops. It is precisely why people like Michael Easson and Peter Sams have been so concerned for many years&mdash;because they do not believe the ACTU truly represents workers. They are in it for themselves. You only have to look at Jennie George's performances around the country in recent times. She is not out there acting in the interests of workers; she is acting for the union oligarchy and to support the ALP's return to government by hook or by crook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, I would have thought, is a devastating indictment. What it means is that someone like Mr Kelty is prepared to put at risk&mdash;and, indeed, to sabotage if necessary&mdash;corporate reforms which are seen to be important by institutional investors, by the financial institutions themselves, by fund managers, by those in the financial press who take an interest in these matters and, I suspect, by the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no, what you have is someone like Bill Kelty weighing into the debate and asking a whole series of tendentious questions: `Does the AMP have a policy on corporate governance?' It is quite clear that the ACTU does not have, so why is he asking the AMP? He asks, `Who in the organisation made the decision to intervene?' Did the rank and file get asked whether Mr Kelty should be weighing in on behalf of his mega-rich mates? Of course they did not. He is doing it off his own bat. He asked, `Has the AMP consulted with its policy holders or trustees?' Again, AMP is charged with the responsibility as a shareholder for making decisions which they regard as being in their own best interests. They are a trustee for very many small investors, and they have a responsibility to ensure that the highest standards of corporate governance prevail. So why is Mr Kelty so utterly disinterested in all these propositions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose question No. 4 is the one that really gives you an indication, because he suggests that AMP should have regard to the implications for corporate blackmail. That can only be designed to intimidate the AMP, and that is precisely why the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> this morning gave it front-page prominence. Then Mr Kelty asked, `Has any AMP employee or representative spoken to other investors and expressed views which may have a bearing on the market price?' That is absolutely nonsensical, because who could ever say what has a bearing on the market price? You never know what affects the movement of a share, other than in broad terms, and certainly, with respect to any conversation that anyone might have had with anyone else about it, it is absolutely impossible to ascribe cause and effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He goes on to talk about whether the analysis and justification is based on short-term or long-term market perceptions. Again, quite clearly, he is simply arguing the case of those with whom he dines in Toorak mansions and those with whom he is closely associated. He is not interested for one moment in the welfare of superannuation funds, in the welfare of financial institutions, in making sure that they measure up to the standards that people like Senator Sherry have spelt out so carefully&mdash;and I think Senator Ferguson also&mdash;in the Senate committee hearings, in relation to the proper standards that ought to be in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point of having those standards if you can have a bullyboy in the ACTU coming in, pushing everyone aside and saying, `Don't worry. I'm standing up for my mates irrespective. I don't care what the merits of the argument are. I want to know why you're taking the opposite side'? I have no doubt that that is precisely the way the union movement operates, and it is undoubtedly with the full approval of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why, when one looks at his recent interventions, we can see that once again they constitute a very serious threat to the integrity of superannuation funds. He cannot have it both ways: he cannot call them donkeys and then insist that people put billions of dollars into their care. But, even more importantly, when he rabbits on about things that&mdash;what did he say; I have forgotten now&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of us are very nervous, especially if retirement is fast approaching. The last thing investors want is to lie awake in the early hours of the morning worrying about their money.</PARA>
<PARA>It is all very well for Mr Keating to urge funds to take decisions that are of much higher risk with the prospect of a higher return. But you only get one chance if you are close to retirement. If you get it wrong, it is all very well to take the long-term perspective, but you do not get the benefit of it. That is why it is so utterly irresponsible of the Prime Minister to be behaving in the way that he is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why Terry McCrann said today that he is not fit to govern. He says that he is not even fit to be a minister, let alone a Prime Minister. His judgment is badly flawed and he lacks self-control. He recites several examples of where the Prime Minister has waded into debates quite improperly in the past in this very sensitive area, where it is important to maintain public confidence. The Prime Minister's contribution is leading to precisely the opposite. It is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, it is typical of the Prime Minister that he denigrates anyone who dares to question him. You will recall that yesterday Mr Ian Matheson, a leading investment fund manager with an investment association, queried the Prime Minister's contribution. He said that he was only in there to help mates. What do you expect from the Prime Minister? He suggested that Mr Matheson was involved in Liberal Party politics and unable to be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know if there is a skerrick of evidence to support that. I have never heard of Mr Matheson, certainly not in Liberal Party circles. I have not the slightest doubt that Mr Keating has never heard of him either. It is the sort of knee-jerk response you get from someone who is totally uninterested in the merits of the issue. He does not in any shape or form want to protect the investment of smaller investors. Coles Myer is a classic case of probably very many thousands of small investors going to get a store discount and finding themselves being pushed around by the Prime Minister. I hope that the Senate will condemn the behaviour of both Mr Kelty and Mr Keating as utterly un-Australian. It is quite antipathetic to the interests of small investors. It is only designed to feather their own nests and push their own mateship arrangements. </PARA>

Senator Alston also said that Jennie George is in it for herself in acting for the ACTU. He said that the Prime Minister is sabotaging corporate reforms and that he dines in Toorak mansions. That is an interesting accusation. There were a whole range of other very personal comments. I am sure that the Prime Minister will not lose any sleep over them. I will be pleased to refer that speech to the superannuation industry. Instead of Liberal Party contributions to superannuation policy, all we got was a diatribe of personal abuse about the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting aspects of this debate about the so-called personal abuse of the Prime Minister is that we get much more vitriol in much greater detail&mdash;much more dirt&mdash;from members of the opposition than we ever do from the Prime Minister. We do not hear the Prime Minister talking about the families of opposition members, where they dine and their financial background, but we hear it from the opposition continually. That sort of abuse is no substitute for good policy. I am going to deal with the policy issues relating to superannuation, unlike the opposition, which criticised both the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the ACTU in this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How did Senator Alston illustrate in his contribution the accusation that the integrity of superannuation funds and the investments of millions of Australian workers are threatened? He did not. He did not deal with that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background to this government's superannuation policy, when we came into office in 1983 we set a strategy where workers would have the equivalent of 15 per cent of their salary paid into super by the year 2002. We set that at nine per cent 2 1/2 years ago with the SGC. We have since announced a further six per cent: three per cent direct from the employee and three per cent from the government vis-a-vis tax collections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the money is coming from, in addition to the quantity of money, is an important issue when dealing with the issue of where the money is invested, how it has been invested and what the record has been. I will come to that a little later. We are creating an enormous pool of savings. It will be some $2,000 billion by the year 2020. One important aspect of this is that it will increase national saving because it will increase the real levels of saving in this country. It will create a major pool of investment and additional investment that will make inroads into our national debt. At the individual level, superannuation will give people comfort and security in their old age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About three-quarters of Australians will, when they retire, receive the equivalent of a pension through their superannuation in excess of the current age pension, which is about $8,300 per year. It is a very important contribution. Where did we hear policy contribution from Senator Alston about those sorts of issues? We did not hear it. Another issue in relation to superannuation is that we are implementing this 15 per cent a little late, I have to say, in the sense of the international community. Comparable Western economies have implemented their compulsory national superannuation contributions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are implementing ours very late, compared with most other countries, with one exception being New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part about our superannuation policy is that this money is primarily invested by the private sector through a system of trustee law. I would have to say as an aside that trustee law was never designed to handle superannuation contributions; it has been more through the evolution of superannuation funds in this country&mdash;long before we came into office&mdash;that superannuation trustees have ended up managing this money. I hope that Senator Kernot heard the contribution of Senator Alston, because in terms of policy debate it was certainly lacking. I certainly hope that that influences the way she acts on this proposal. That is a very quick overview of what we have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that to the coalition. Where is their policy on superannuation? We heard two parts of it at the last election. One was to freeze superannuation contribution levels at what would have been four or five per cent, had the opposition been elected. If they still maintain that policy, it will be seven per cent. They were also going to allow some people to draw on their superannuation for housing deposits. I will come back to the opposition's position a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we doing to protect the integrity of the superannuation funds in this country? I am going to run through what we are going.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Prime Minister, both as Treasurer and Prime Minister, has taken a deep personal interest in the development of superannuation and the integrity of the system in this country, as indeed has the Secretary of the ACTU, Bill Kelty. I think it is to the credit of Bill Kelty and the general trade union movement that we have moved away from the system we had in 1983. I have outlined the changes that have evolved in our policy development. Prior to 1983, less than 40 per cent of the work force received superannuation. It was generally confined to people in the public sector, management and middle management, the highly paid and, generally, not women workers. We have spread superannuation to over 90 per cent of the work force at the last count.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What are we doing about protecting the members of funds?  We have enacted the superannuation industry supervisory regime. I represented the government in the passage of that legislation in this chamber. We have given the industry watchdog, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, more powers and resources to supervise funds. The ISC's annual report recently tabled in parliament shows that it conducted nearly 800 fund audits in the last financial year. The ISC concluded that most funds are running satisfactorily, shortcomings are minor, and that funds are receptive to fixing them where they arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there were some problems and the ISC, as an activist regulatory body, highlighted a number of these. Money which had been embezzled by its financial controller was restored to one fund, and that financial controller has been referred to the New South Wales police. A small investment manager is being referred to the Queensland police. A Queensland auditor has been banned from auditing superannuation funds. We have moved to protect small balances. We have established a Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. They are the sorts of policies that we have implemented legislatively to protect the integrity of superannuation funds.</PARA>

The debate about where the money is to go and how it is to be invested is a very important part of the development of superannuation in this country. There have been criticisms&mdash;I think in some areas, legitimate criticisms&mdash;of the poor performance of funds over the last year or two; fund members have complained about that. But I think the other side of the coin is that the benefits of superannuation are long term in a diversified portfolio. It is the average return that it is important to be highlighting to members, rather than the short-term return. I can recall back in the 80s when funds were returning 15, 20, 25 per cent. We have acted and we have required funds to report their average return for the past five years, so that you get a truer picture of what is going on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation trustees are still required in law to take an active and integral interest in where the funds are invested. You cannot simply shove funds off to fund managers. Certainly, fund managers have an important role to play, but it is the role of superannuation trustees that is critical. A media release yesterday from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trustees are the cornerstone of super fund performance in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not read it out. The super trustees have a very  important role in ensuring a broader range of investments, in ensuring that we have adequate investment in venture capital, in new technology and in infrastructure&mdash;if we ever get the opportunity to be able to sell off the leases of the airports, for example, which should be very attractive to superannuation companies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson, I am sorry that you missed Senator Alston's appalling contribution and I am disappointed that you are not participating in this debate. This debate about the rate of return, where we invest the money, whether you direct investment into particular categories of investment in this country, is a legitimate debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as actually directing superannuation funds and trustees, this government has put it very clearly on the record that we will not direct. But some of the issues that I have highlighted&mdash;an education campaign for trustees and the adoption of various categories of investment&mdash;are attracting into specific areas some of the superannuation moneys that we have in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what we have at the moment is not a policy debate by the opposition; what we have is a scare campaign by the opposition, pretending that the government will tell funds exactly where to invest. That is what we have at the moment, a scare campaign, but that is no substitute for good policy. What we did as a government when you were in opposition at the last election was highlight our own policies as well as the glaring weaknesses of yours and, fortunately, the Australian electorate did not elect you. What we are doing in government is making legitimate criticism, fostering debate about this issue of superannuation investment, and also enacting change in the superannuation area to deal with some of the problems that people have concerning superannuation returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When are we going to see the opposition's policy on superannuation? Are they going to have the same policy as at the last election which will more than halve the final retirement incomes of people in this country? By freezing superannuation contributions at seven per cent rather than allowing them to grow to 15 per cent, you will more than halve people's retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is presenting the opposition policy? Is it you, Senator Watson? What happened to Mr Connolly? What happened to him? Where is the policy? What has happened to your contribution? We know about the tensions in the opposition. They do not have a spokesperson on superannuation; they cannot make up their mind. That is one of the reasons they cannot debate this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress `Australia' as distinct from `the members of the funds', because I have little doubt that the overwhelming majority of fund managers and trustees have been acting as prudently as they can to further the interests of the members of their funds as they see them. I think there is a very strong awareness out there of the requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act on their actions and, if anything, there is probably an excessive conservatism about meeting the requirements of that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe that the fund managers are not necessarily acting in the long-term interests of Australia because I am not persuaded, frankly, that placing 40 per cent of funds in blue-chip company stock, 40 per cent in property and bonds and 20 per cent overseas does a great deal of good for our small business sector, for our infrastructure development, for housing customers, for farmers, for venture and development capital, for research and for export industries. No, we should not be in the business of using funds to prop up government failings, to adequately fund infrastructure or research and development, and I think the government stands condemned for starving these sectors of proper levels of government funding for many years now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, when the superannuation industry is propped up by $5 billion a year of tax concessions, when it has received a huge free kick with compulsory superannuation and when this government is now offering it a further $10 billion a year by way of employee co-contributions, this is our major pool of capital in this country and we are legitimately entitled to ask whether the Australian people as a whole are getting value for money on that investment. I think the answer is, `No, they aren't. Not quite&mdash;they aren't.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, I submitted a minority report. I dissented from the findings of the committee that there should be no directions on where super funds invest their money. I pointed out in that report that the short-term view of funds in maximising members' returns `ignores the possibility of greater returns from investments in Australian firms because of the higher levels of general economic activity which arise from increased local investment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence on involvement of super funds in venture and development capital highlighted the inadequacy of the response from the funds. The former chairman of the Industry Research and Development Board, Mr Dennis Hanley, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing is going to happen in the present environment unless some form of compulsion starts the ball rolling.</PARA>
<PARA>This week we heard the government tell us, `You know, it has not worked but we are going to make the market work more effectively.' I will tell you what Mr Hanley said about that. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is that in Australia we have a very under-developed capital market by comparison with the rest of the world. I have had to plead for money in all of the markets. This market is probably at the cowboy end of the spectrum and because of that there is a great need for it to be nurtured and developed. People talk about the market as if it were a real market. It is not. It is controlled by a whole series of interests that I do not think are present in some of the larger and more liquid markets available overseas. We should not compare ourselves with New York. We certainly should not compare ourselves with London. And probably, thank God, we are not the same as Tokyo.</PARA>
<PARA>All this reliance on market as some kind of solution&mdash;as though it operates the same as everywhere else in the world&mdash;is wrong. I think there should be a very small percentage of super required to be invested in a national development fund to provide patient capital for small- and medium-sized Australian firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of this report I also called for an absolute limit to be placed on the assets that a super fund could invest offshore, and that the taxation of offshore funds be revised to prefer investment of funds in Australia. It is not feasible or desirable to ban offshore investment, but the assets of super funds benefit from tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our super funds have not proven to be particularly patriotic. Five years ago, our funds invested 11 per cent of their assets overseas. In 1995 it was 16 per cent. While investments in Australia have grown by 50 per cent in that period, investments offshore have grown by a whopping 137 per cent. Honestly, where is the economic sense in that when our nation has a chronic national savings shortage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Alston of the importance of ensuring that our massive pool of super funds&mdash;some $200 billion&mdash;is put to the most productive use. In 1992 Senator Alston and the committee said that there is a need for the financial markets to respond. They said, `We will look at this again in three years time.' Well, that time is now. It is unfortunate that it took the Prime Minister's comments about donkeys to get this debate started, but I am delighted that we are having this debate. It is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are very concerned that their money will be there when they retire, but they are equally concerned that this pool of capital is put to the best use for Australia's long-term future.

There is only one purpose for superannuation and superannuation contributions: to provide an income in retirement to the members of the fund. The way that income is derived is for the trustees and managers of the fund to obtain the best return possible for each individual member so that the member can receive that retirement income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take the responsibility for investment direction and choice away from fund managers threatens the integrity and the purpose of the funds. In his contribution, Senator Sherry spoke about his great policies for superannuation. I would remind Senator Sherry that there are up to 2 million people in Australia who are going to receive no benefit whatsoever from his policies because they are the people who are either unemployed or under-employed and for whom no contributions are being made. Yet the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Senator Sherry talk about the people who are going to have a lump sum of some $450,000 which will enable them to have a retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of Australians who will never benefit from the current superannuation arrangements. I want to talk about Senator Sherry's policy at the last election. If I remember rightly, at the last election the Labor Party were trumpeting their policy that people would be able to borrow on their superannuation contributions for housing. What happened to that policy? Is it another lie? Can we believe a word that the Prime Minister or anybody in the government says about their future policies because this policy does not exist any more?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry also said that the government is not going to ask funds to direct their investments. I would like the government to explain how they are going to encourage&mdash;I think that was the word Senator Cook used&mdash;fund managers to invest in small business. What sort of intimidation are they going to use to make sure that the fund managers invest where this government think they ought to? The integrity of those funds should remain. There should be no chance that the government can interfere in the direction that fund managers take in the investment of their available funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Kernot whose money it really is when we are talking about the funds that are controlled by fund managers.

I say to Senator Kernot, when she gets up and talks about this residue of funds that should be used in the interests of Australia, that the funds are deposited on behalf of the fund members and they should be invested for those fund members in such a way that they get the best return possible. </PARA>

The Prime Minister is well known for insulting the financial sector when it does not do what we wants. I think we all know how much attention the money markets give these outbursts. He carried on about the fact that the money markets did not invest in Australia, but that has not led to any investment. Any investment that has occurred is incidental&mdash;a decision motivated by commerce, not by any concern for the words of the Prime Minister in parliament or in public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We regret the fact that the government has given up its power to directly regulate the economy. We regret that giving up these powers means that the government and people of Australia are entirely dependent on the money markets for the health of the economy and that all that is left for the government is the spectre of the Prime Minister carrying on in parliament about the failure of people who are not there and owe him nothing to do his will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with giving up any control of macro-economics, the government has moved to relinquish control of investment in industry, and in large part relinquish its responsibility in relation to infrastructure. I think `threat' is too strong a word, but I will outline again what I see as the major problem with the government's approach to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is not the best savings vehicle. Managed funds tend to give the lowest returns to investors, according to a recent report by the Australian Consumers Association. They have significant problems in terms of making capital inaccessible or imposing large costs on those who try to extract funds early. They are not really substitutes for pensions since fund members can often get lump sum payouts. Funds tend to invest conservatively and so are of little value in providing capital for new ventures or small business or the development of industries. In other words, they are a poor investment vehicle as well as a poor savings vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has pegged its savings plan on superannuation. Superannuation is a keystone in the accord agreements as a trade-off against wage and salary increases. It is seen as a way to reduce government retirement payouts. It is seen as a way to provide for capitalisation of private sector owned public infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make this work, the government will have to make changes. It has created a superannuation industry and now it will need to ensure that all superannuation becomes unavailable to people until retirement. It is already trying to force employees to put more money into superannuation. It will need to direct superannuation so that the investment outcomes are those the government wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening is that the government is creating a dishonest quasi-government and a pool of funds forcibly collected, a quasi-tax, which are then administered by the private sector under the direction of the minister and cabinet but are not accountable to taxpayers or the legislature because it is not a real tax and this is not a real government business enterprise&mdash;not that we have much control over what they do either. If the government was honest it would either leave things to the market or create a government retirement fund or superannuation fund and require everyone to contribute to that. It would directly and openly control investment by this organisation in areas argued politically to be socially desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest comments by the Prime Minister simply confirm our suspicion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is worth while to restate the motion moved by Senator Alston because we have just had a series of speakers from the government and minor parties who seem to endorse the outrageous comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threats to the integrity of super funds and the investments of millions of Australian workers constituted by the outrageous threats and behaviour of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the ACTU.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week in this parliament the coalition parties brought home in a very stark fashion through raw statistics just how this government has created a wide gap between the rich and poor. One statistic was that in the mid-1970s some 65 per cent of all households in Australia had incomes between $22,000 and $72,000. Some 16 years later in the mid-1990s we now find that that figure has fallen from 65 per cent to 40 per cent. They were the raw figures we produced last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there needs to be evidence that this government through its attitudes and actions has been the creator of a growing gap between rich and poor and has ultimately alienated itself from the workers in this country, then Bill Kelty's attempted intimidation of AMP and the Prime Minister's attack on the fund managers is proof positive. The very sight of the union lord using workers' savings as a tool to defend a cause of a corporate friend or mate that is utterly unrelated to the lives and wellbeing of the workers really must anger those employees forced to take up union superannuation funds and those employees that Mr Bill Kelty is supposed to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It now brings into question the very fear that many have of the responsibilities the unions have in managing superannuation funds&mdash;that is, workers really have no choice, there is no portability. There is a fear that the unions may politically use those funds and, even worse, that the trustees may well be feathering their own nests. The fact that those workers are in the hands of the existing ACTU leadership is a real fear. Clearly, other union heads have been startled by Mr Kelty's intervention to attempt to blackmail the AMP and know the very risk that Mr Kelty has put them in. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> quotes the secretary of the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council, Mr Peter Sams, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . many union officials had contacted him "to indicate that, like me, they feel that it is a little unusual for Bill Kelty to be taking sides in a fight between corporate moguls".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Maybe Bill believes in one side against the other [in the Coles Myer affair]. His friendship with Mr Fox is well known. But what interest does the union movement have in that?"</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the point, so aptly put by Mr Peter Sams. It is little wonder that the workers do feel alienated from their unions and that the unions are suffering a severe slump in membership. The recklessness and damage done by Mr Kelty does not really measure up against the Prime Minister's own damage and recklessness when he made his comments last week. For the very same reasons that Mr Bill Kelty interfered in the Coles-Myer boardroom fight, the Prime Minister also interfered. Something that was lost on Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts was that these comments in relation to superannuation were motivated by a direct interference in the Coles-Myer boardroom dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With no concern for the integrity of the worker superannuation contributions, the Prime Minister launched a public attack against the AMP and the fund managers and simultaneously brought the cornerstone of the government's national savings policy into disarray. He has further shaken what little confidence the workers had in the employee-employer superannuation system. It really is laughable that within a week of the government's launching its Shaping the Nation booklet, holding up the compulsory superannuation guarantee as a achievement of this government and spending $12 million pushing that achievement, one comment by the Prime Minister has it in tatters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are honest, you have to admit that the major threat to superannuation and public confidence in superannuation in this country is the lack of Liberal Party policy, the lack of any coalition policy on the issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that, Senator. Since then, there has been a range of changes in superannuation in this country. The government has gone further to increase its commitment to superannuation. By the year 2002, 15 per cent will be paid into superannuation funds on behalf of all employees: nine per cent by the employer, three per cent by the worker and three per cent by the federal government. The last thing we heard from the Liberal Party was that they were going to cap SGC contributions at six per cent and five per cent for small employers. They have not caught up with the debate. They are saying nothing that would indicate their policy, so what we get instead is abuse of the Prime Minister and abuse of Bill Kelty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party position represents a very genuine threat to the retirement of workers in this country. Without the surety of some sort of bipartisan policy position, without knowing what the coalition would do if it ever was elected to government, people are uncertain, they are concerned. The Liberal Party really does owe it to Australia to come clean on its policies for superannuation and hopefully endorse the government's proposals as the Australian community, business, unions and workers have done. I know it will look like you are coming second again but it will at least provide some surety and some confidence in the system. That is the only real threat to confidence in the superannuation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at what the Liberal Party members have been saying recently, their spokesperson was denied preselection, so clearly they are not terribly serious about the issue. They hint at all the feel good subjects in superannuation that they might be supporting. They might be in favour of tax concessions. They might be in favour of super for housing, even though the debate has moved on. We have superannuation companies providing finance for housing. We do not have the deposit gap problem that the super for housing policy was designed to attend to. But, like the Democrats, the coalition think if it sounds good they will mention it whenever they talk about superannuation without actually committing to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They talk a lot about choice of funds. Senator McGauran got onto that one. That is a real joke because in the second wave of industrial legislation in Western Australia we are seeing the Liberal Party in Western Australia ensuring that employers have a veto over employee choice of superannuation funds. The Liberal Party have an ideological opposition to any worker or union involvement in superannuation funds. That is why they hate Bill Kelty, that is why they hate employee choice. The attack on the industry funds and the attack on employee choice are part of their whole approach to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing they hint at is that they are going to let the banks into the system to offer super savings accounts because that keeps the banks friendly. Again, if you say it quickly it sounds like a good idea. But they only hint at those things. We do not know what they stand</PARA>
<PARA>for. In this country the superannuation industry, workers and business are calling for some sort of bipartisan support for the government's proposition, which has been broadly accepted as being in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has sought to build confidence in the system in this country. We have introduced a range of measures in recent years. We have enacted the SIS regime to clarify the responsibilities of trustees and the powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. We have established a Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. We have taken steps to protect small superannuation balances from being eroded by fees and charges. We are committed to promoting the benefits of superannuation through the public education system that we have launched. The government is very serious about protecting the confidence in and the integrity of the superannuation system and has taken concrete steps in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few days, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has contributed to commencing a very necessary and long overdue public debate. Superannuation in this country is provided by the private sector. The government is committed to ensuring the private sector provides that superannuation vehicle. It currently has in the order of $200 billion invested in that market, and it is predicted to increase tenfold in the next 25 years. So we are talking about an enormous amount of capital in Australian society being involved in this superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a range of changes in the financial markets, including obviously a movement of funds away from the banking sector towards the superannuation sector. We are seeing super funds beginning to invest in new products, including superannuation investment in housing loans. We are seeing more and more Australians relying on superannuation as their principal retirement vehicle. There are very good reasons why we ought to be focusing public debate on management and investment policies of superannuation funds. There are big public policy issues at stake. There is a big interest in Australian society in making sure that those management and investment policies are directed correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, in its report in 1992 into `Super and the Financial System', recognised the need to have that debate and to monitor developments. In that report at page 13, after talking about the development of the superannuation industry and the need for balanced and dynamic growth in the economy, the committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government monitor trends and changes in the investment portfolios of superannuation funds to enable appropriate judgments and decisions to be made about the extent of diversification.</PARA>
<PARA>The joint parliamentary committee recognised, in its unanimous report, as early as 1992, that this was a big public policy issue that needed to be closely monitored by the government. I put it to the Senate that is what the Prime Minister is doing&mdash;closely monitoring the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had further recognition by the joint select committee recently of the need for the committee next year to instigate a term of reference on some of these issues. Senator Ferguson would know that Senator Watson and others, including myself, have been talking about a reference which would enable us to look at the needs for infrastructure funding in Australia; at the role of superannuation in providing that funding and funding in terms of small and medium sized business enterprises; and whether the investment of these superannuation funds occurs in the local economy or is directed overseas. They are big issues that the Senate select committee has recognised need to be addressed as public policy questions. We will be looking at them under a term of reference next year. The Prime Minister is recognising and is starting the debate that a lot of other people have begun to concentrate on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are major issues, particularly in relation to short termism in the attitudes of investment managers. In submissions to the Senate select committee, managers have recognised that it is a problem for them that people tend to focus on the short-term rather than the long-term needs for an investment strategy. The focus has tended to be on traditional investments and short-term returns rather than looking at innovative investments and the longer term benefits that might flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite proper for the Prime Minister to start this debate. It is a debate that we ought to take far more seriously than the contributors today did. The government will not direct superannuation investments. The whole trustee structure we have established provides that trustees act to maximise the interests of beneficiaries. We do encourage the long-term view by fund managers. We encourage public education on these issues. We expect that the vast amount of capital invested in superannuation in this country will also do something to benefit the other public policy goals of developing jobs and of developing the economy in Australia.

I do not mean this as a criticism of Hansard, but I have had one occasion this year when I said that I was not satisfied with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> pink, for the simple reason that it did not accurately reflect the speech that I gave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that reflects the problem of how far does <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> go in trying to be verbatim and how far should <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> go in trying to make us look more articulate. I think there is a certain amount of that in the process as well. I think Hansard have a very difficult task, because if they reported verbatim everything that we said, senators and members would always be complaining, saying, `I would rather you didn't say that. I'd rather you had me saying this, because this is what I meant to say.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly on behalf of the government, in reading the annual report of the Department of Parliamentary Reporting Staff, I would like to indicate my congratulations to the very effective service that is provided through the department. Looking at the workload indicators from 1990-91 to 1994-95 on pages 12 and 13, there has been a very significant increase in the workload&mdash;the number of chamber sitting days and the number of committee hearings covered.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first report I have tabled recommends the construction of a modern purpose-built field hospital for the Australian Army at Holsworthy to replace the existing inadequate medical facilities of 1 Field Hospital at Ingleburn in Sydney's west. The proposed hospital is required to support Australian Defence Force operations during a contingency, in accordance with the defence policy of self-reliance, as outlined in the 1994 Defence White Paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed facility will provide health care for regular Defence personnel located in the area known as the Liverpool Military Area, as well as Army Reserve personnel and visiting overseas military forces. The hospital will consist of a field component, and an Australian Support Area component which will continue to service those personnel who do not deploy when the field hospital deploys on operations. The facility is based on a 25 bed ward and a 16 bed self-care rehabilitation unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost when referred to the Committee was $19.7m at December 1994 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In common with the defence forces of other developed nations, the Australian Defence Force provides medical and dental treatment to serving members; this is to maintain the highest standards of medical, dental and physical fitness. Such treatment is provided both in the field and in the barracks environment and ensures that members remain fit and available for operations. Field treatment for the Australian Army is provided by field hospitals such as 1 Field Hospital in Sydney and 2 Field Hospital in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the public hearing a proposal was put by the Southwestern Sydney Area Health Service that Defence should make use of facilities at the Liverpool Hospital.. However, while the Committee recognises the need for certain medical procedures to be performed at civilian hospitals the Committee agrees with the Department of Defence that operational requirements necessitate 1 Field Hospital possessing a wide range of medical capabilities. These include operating theatres, intensive care, pathology and radiology services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During its inquiry, earlier this year, into a replacement medical centre at RAAF Richmond the Committee expressed concern at the high incidence of sporting injuries requiring treatment. While the Committee recognised the need for Service personnel to become and remain physically fit, it questioned whether this fitness was being achieved in the most efficient manner. At the Holsworthy hearing the Sectional Committee was informed by Defence that injuries resulting from either training or sporting activities were of concern to Defence and were currently being investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the Department of Defence advise it of the results of the study being undertaken of training and sporting injuries in the Australian Defence Force which require medical treatment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled recommends the construction of functional working accommodation for the Ready Reserve at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, Qld at a cost of $21.3m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1991 the Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon. Robert Ray, announced the Ready Reserve Program. The Ready Reserve components were formed in the Australian Defence Force in 1992 as a means of increasing the ADF's capacity to deploy well trained personnel in shorter time scales than conventional reserves</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This implementation has increased the number of infantry battalions within Enoggera from two to three, without the provision of any new facilities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success of the Ready Reserve implementation relies on the ability of 49 Royal Queensland Regiment to be an operationally effective unit. 49 Royal Queensland Regiment occupies facilities dispersed over nine separate locations. The separate locations, lack of functionality and in some cases inadequate size, detract from unit effectiveness and the effective utilisation of accommodation in Gallipoli Barracks. This also impacts on the morale of unit members as they can see that other battalions are better accommodated than 49 RQR. The unit layout as it now exists leads to inefficiencies in control, administration and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Construction of the proposed facilities will redress significant shortfalls existing in accommodation of 49 Royal Queensland Regiment at Enoggera. However, should there be a change in policy in relation to the retention or the role of the Ready Reserve, the facilities would be adaptable for use by other units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has always been concerned with energy conservation measures. Therefore, the Committee requires the Department of Defence to undertake, as soon as possible, an energy audit to assess the efficiency of the existing energy management system at Enoggera Barracks. The Committee further requires the Department of Defence to make available to it, the consultants' examination of energy consumption costs for this project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third report which I have tabled involves the provision of living-in accommodation at HMAS Harman, ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal will provide an increase in the current living-in accommodation on the base from 232 personnel to a total of 428. It will replace existing unsuitable and substandard accommodation for 54 personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that this proposal, which will cost</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$18.3m, should proceed. It is proposed that construction will commence in January 1996 with completion in late 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major function of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> is to provide accommodation and messing for personnel working on the base and naval personnel serving in the Canberra area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has concluded that there is a lack of suitable available living-in accommodation at HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Harman</EMPHASIS> which has resulted in the base having one of the highest allowance costs of any naval establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alternatives examined aimed at reducing allowance costs have indicated that the provision of additional living-in accommodation at HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Harman</EMPHASIS> to be the most cost-effective solution due to the well developed infrastructure, adequate land, location, and lower capital and recurrent costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the location and extent of the proposed development at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> conforms with zone planning and will address immediate accommodation, messing and recreational requirements. The report recommends that the Department of Defence undertake a study of the use of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> as a possible tri-Service centre of living-in accommodation for single Defence personnel working in the Canberra area. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also canvasses the impact of aircraft noise on the base and the need for a the scope of the project to be extended to provide a new formal entrance to the base. It also recommends further study of the practicalities of using grey water to irrigate the playing fields and the landscaping.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AIRPORTS BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports Bill provides for major reforms to the operation, development and regulation of Federal airports. It's a bill founded upon the significant investment made in Australia's airports in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, since 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has greatly enhanced most of the airports it presently operates. In this period, the most notable changes have been capacity increases at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport, international terminal improvements at Sydney and Melbourne, new terminals for Alice Springs and Darwin, supporting work for domestic terminal improvements around Australia, and most recently, a grand new international terminal at Brisbane Airport. The FAC has completed all these works on a commercial basis, without any recourse to Budget funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of their completion, FAC airports are better placed to meet both current demand and forecast increases in this demand. They are well set for the next phase of their operation under private leasing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future Operational Responsibility for Airports</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With much of the infrastructure enhanced, the Government announced in `Working Nation' last year that we would develop a new regulatory regime for airports and conduct a scoping study into the possible sale of the Corporation's airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following endorsement of those plans at last year's ALP National Conference, the Government decided to proceed with sales by way of 50 year leases, with options for a further 49 years. The bill requires Government approval for the issuing of these options. It also dictates that each lessee be a company set up to operate the airport, and that there be only one company assuming each lease. Where a group owns more than one airport the separate airport companies may have a common holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to lease the airports underlines the strategic importance of the airports managed by the FAC, and the public interest considerations associated with them. The use of long term leases means that the Commonwealth will maintain ownership of the airports and that leased airports remain Commonwealth Places. It also supports continuation of Commonwealth regulatory control of the airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Budget this year the Government announced its leasing strategy. That strategy opted for the leasing of FAC airports in two stages, with the four major airports (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth) leased in the first phase, a phase in which Sydney will be jointly leased with the new airport at Badgerys Creek, Sydney West Airport. The latter decision reflected the outcome of market testing and overseas experience which suggested that multi-airport systems were far more successful when developed on a complementary rather than competitive basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's intention is for the first stage to be completed by the end of 1996, with the second stage involving the remaining FAC airports taking place throughout 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This timetable is now jeopardised by Coalition threats to excise Sydney from the first phase of the leasing process. Such threats amount to economic blackmail, pure and simple. Worse still, they are nothing short of economic lunacy on the part of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The leasing strategy was designed to ensure maximum bidding and price tension, and therefore return to the taxpayer, by putting all the most attractive assets on the block first. If the most attractive asset, Sydney, was withheld, cross ownership restrictions would ensure that bids would either not occur, or would be far below the real value of Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For that reason if the present leasing strategy, a strategy recommended to the Government by the best expertise of outside consultants, recommended on the basis of feedback from potential bidders, is blocked by the Parliament, the entire leasing process will of necessity be put on hold. As a result the aspirations of Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide for new airport operators will be frustrated by the economic irresponsibility of the Federal Coalition. In addition, work on the upgrading of Adelaide Airport's main runway will also be delayed as funds for this project are predicated on the leasing of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time the value of Sydney Airport itself is depreciated by the Coalition proposal to make its leasing conditional on an intersecting runway configuration, a configuration involving dependent cross runway jet operations. According to Air Services Australia this would cut Sydney's capacity by up to 35% while guaranteeing the airport is operated in a manner that does not maximise safety. Again, in the interests of protecting the taxpayer and flying public, the Government cannot accept such a naked attempt to vandalise the process. Any Government who did would be grossly negligent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney West</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Coalition persists with its attempt to stymie the leasing process, it will have to bear responsibility for the resulting impact in delaying the development of Sydney's second airport, Sydney West.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Government's leasing timetable the target date for completion of the first stage of Sydney West is the end of 1999. To meet this target the Government has approved planned expenditure of nearly $1 billion on the airport and associated transport links.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first stage of development, built to a standard to accommodate major domestic and international jet traffic, will include a 2900 metre runway, a 10 000 square metre passenger terminal, parking spaces for up to four B747s and four B737s, and international standard air traffic control, rescue and fire fighting facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Government's leasing strategy the FAC will retain contractual responsibility for the development of Sydney West Airport until it is leased jointly with Sydney Airport. The lessee will then be required, as a condition of the lease, to complete the first stage of Sydney West to the Government's specifications and timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The leasing process provides the revenue to construct Sydney West via a special levy at Kingsford Smith Airport. Therefore any delay in the leasing of Sydney sabotages what is a critical and tight timetable for the new airport. It would certainly guarantee that Sydney West is not available in time for the Year 2000 Olympic Games. If the Opposition persists with their threat to block the legislation, then responsibility for delays and traffic chaos at the time of the 2000 Olympics will rest squarely upon John Howard and his colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's Policy and Future Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the general principles underlying the leasing process, many of which are reflected in the objects clause of the bill, the key points to note are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the airports must be majority Australian owned</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government will seek diversity of ownership to the maximum extent possible</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government will encourage transparency and benchmark competition between the airports</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a minimum, there will be separate ownership of Sydney (including Sydney West) from Melbourne and Brisbane airports</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ownership of the airports by individual airlines and associated interests will be restricted to 5%</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commonwealth will retain responsibility for land use, planning and building controls at the major airports</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commonwealth will retain reserve powers to deal with demand management issues that may arise during the course of the 50 year leases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By enforcing these principles the Government hopes to see Commonwealth ownership through the FAC replaced by strategic, well resourced private sector organisations capable of;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">developing and operating the airports in accordance with best international practice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">using local industry and local headquarters to promote Australia's interests in the region; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">boosting the export of aviation services throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In seeking to give effect to these objectives, the Commonwealth has undertaken extensive consultation with a range of interested parties (including the States and Territories, local government, the airlines, the aviation industry, other airport users and potential investors). This consultation process included a market testing program in February this year and the circulation in August of a package that included drafts of the two airports bills. These processes worked well and the comments received have helped shape the final regulatory arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports Bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill provide the legislative framework for the granting of leases to airport specific companies initially owned by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The companion bill, the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1995, being presented on behalf of my colleague the Hon Kim Beazley, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, provides the legislative basis to facilitate the leasing of the major Federal airports. It provides for the granting of leases, the transfer of assets and FAC staff to the airport companies, and related sales matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports Bill sets out the details of the post leasing regulatory arrangements to apply to the airports. Responsibility for the regulation of on-airport matters, which currently resides with the FAC as a self administering government authority, will remain with the Commonwealth at each `core regulated airports', as well as other airports specified in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Core regulated airports listed in the bill are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney (KSA), Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Darwin, Hobart, Launceston, Townsville, Coolangatta, Canberra, Alice Springs and Sydney West.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Government preference for a general economic regulator, rather than an industry specific arrangement, responsibility for the administration of Government policies in relation to airport pricing and related post leasing matters will be administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new roles will not alter or interfere with the cornerstones of our aviation policy arrangements or the important roles currently performed by individual agencies including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which will have primary responsibility for air safety in Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Services Australia, which will oversee the national airways system, air traffic services and aviation rescue and fire fighting services</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the Department of Transport, who will retain responsibility for aviation security arrangements as well as aircraft noise, engine emissions and curfew policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure successful operation of the airports, it will be essential for airport operators to understand and respond to the needs of communities, passengers and airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed given their critical importance and potential impact on communities and regions, airport operators will have to be doubly sensitive to local issues, especially those involving noise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative provisions require airport operators to advise on all consultations undertaken with key stakeholders such as the States and Territories, local government bodies, airlines, and other interested parties, both during the process of developing draft master and major development plans and environment plans, and prior to such plans being released for public comment. The public comment provisions then require airport operators to advise the Minister on the public comments received, and to have due regard for these comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, opportunities for comment and consultation now available under current price oversight arrangements will apply when this becomes the responsibility of ACCC post leasing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of other provisions in the bill underline the Government's commitment to retaining effective public interest regulatory control. Provisions include the requirement that;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">leases can be transferred only with Ministerial approval</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the airport-operator company will have statutory authority to use the airport site as an airport</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the airport leasing company will be restricted to carrying on activities related to or incidental to airport operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last of these will ensure that airport operators are not distracted by non-airport activities, and that airports are not put at risk by unrelated or non-core financial activities. The provisions will, however, allow airport operators to become involved in land transport access improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The leasing provisions will ensure that current leases with the FAC become subleases, including the domestic terminal leases held by the airlines, as well as leases held by other on-airport businesses. All such leases will be transferred with existing obligations and benefits intact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, airport operators will be required to make payments in lieu of rates as the FAC currently does.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restrictions on ownership and control of airport-operator companies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill requires airport-operator companies to be majority Australian owned, limiting the maximum level of foreign ownership to 49%. It backs up the `Australian' status of airport operator companies by requiring that a majority of directors be either Australian citizens, and/or residents, and that central management and control be exercised from within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the 5% limit on airline ownership the airport-operator company will also be subject to a 15% limit on cross-ownership for the major airports: Sydney and Sydney West together with Melbourne; and Sydney and Sydney West together with Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This restriction will be further supplemented by a Ministerial power to declare a person to have `practical control' (that is, control through some arrangement or agreement but which does not breach the 15% cross-ownership limit).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Land use, planning and building controls</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will retain control over land use planning and building at the major airports. This will also ensure a nationally consistent approach to planning and building matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current arrangements, the FAC is responsible for land use, planning and building approvals at its airports. The FAC consults with State, Territory and local governments, the airlines and other airport users on proposed airport developments. This legislation builds on and strengthens these arrangements, particularly in relation to land use planning. This will help ensure compatible development in noise affected areas off-airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the bill, each airport-operator of a core regulated airport will be required to prepare:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an airport master plan&mdash;essentially a long term land use plan appropriate to meet the forecast demands over a 20 year planning period; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">development plans for any major projects (eg runway, terminal developments) at airports which will require environmental impact assessment (as is currently the case, where significant environmental impacts would result).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These master plans and major development plans will be subject to Ministerial approval. The bill also requires the airport-operator company to undertake a `public comment' process with master plans, major development plans and environment strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The detailed arrangements will be set out in regulations to be developed in consultation with the industry and other interested parties. The Airports Bill allows the regulations to specify matters to be addressed by airport operators in developing their draft plans. This will ensure there is flexibility and scope to address emerging issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth recognises the legitimate interests of the States and Territories in planning issues relating to airports and wishes to achieve appropriate outcomes in this important area. Through the provisions in the bill and the administration of the new regulatory arrangements, the Commonwealth will pursue the orderly planning and development of airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, in particular, substantial scope to protect areas surrounding the major airports from residential and other development incompatible with the long term use of the airport. Whilst constitutionally this is a State responsibility, the Commonwealth is committed to working closely with the States, and in turn expects the States' cooperation on land use planning in the vicinity of airports. This will be fundamental to avoiding any repetition of the problems created by inappropriate State and Local Government approaches to zoning and development around some of Australia's major airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environment management</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The leasing process has provided the opportunity to review current processes and put in place arrangements to ensure improved environmental planning in the future. The leasing process is designed to guarantee responsible environmental behaviour by all new airport operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vital new element will be the requirement to develop and implement approved environment management strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of these strategies by airport operators will be required to exhibit due regard for the range of public comments likely to be received, (including from State, Territory and local governments, local communities, and other interested parties) and will be subject to Ministerial approval. In this respect, airport environment committees such as those already established at a number of major airports will help facilitate the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The airport regulatory arrangements to apply post leasing will supplement the operation of existing legislation, as well as regulations relating to the curfew, runway operations, flight paths and noise acquisition/insulation programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accounts and reports of airport-operator company</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transparency of each individual airport's operations is an important regulatory requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporations Law provides a ready source of guidelines and requirements for financial accounting and reporting by airport operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government will ensure that airport operators report on an airport-by-airport basis, both to enable financial transparency, and to promote benchmark comparisons between airports. This is an area where the Corporations Law alone will not achieve adequate outcomes, because it allows consolidation of the accounts of subsidiary companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports Bill therefore allows for regulations that force new operators to produce stand-alone financial accounts and reports for submission to the ACCC. At the same time the reporting and accounting provisions of the bill encourage the use of common terminology. The Government believes such transparency provisions will complement the general economic regulatory approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pricing and Quality of Service</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the approach adopted by the Government in other industry sectors, the ACCC will be responsible for prices oversight of the major airports. Prices surveillance by the ACCC will include monitoring of price caps set by the Government at the four major airports&mdash;Sydney (KSA), Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. The price caps, which will apply to aeronautical charges and be developed as part of the leasing negotiations, will operate for five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pricing arrangements will provide flexibility for caps to be adjusted to accommodate necessary infrastructure expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, aeronautical-related services will be subject to monitoring at these four airports by the ACCC. This decision follows concern about the potential for the exercise of market power in the provision of those services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At other regulated airports, aeronautical charges will be monitored by the ACCC to enable an assessment of pricing levels post leasing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure their continuing adequacy, these arrangements will be reviewed before the end of the first five year pricing period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future Airport Operations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill places a restraint on the Commonwealth not to close or vary airport leases without the consent of the lessee. An airport-lessee company may, however, choose to surrender an airport lease to the Commonwealth on mutually agreed terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed airports regime, airport operators will be required to act in a manner consistent with international obligations. If necessary, specific regulations made to this effect, can cover all major airports in Australia, not only those currently operated by the FAC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations can be made under the bill to control on-airport activities including liquor, commercial trading in goods and services, vehicle movements, gambling and smoking. In the absence of regulations being made by the Commonwealth, State legislation would apply. The Commonwealth is currently discussing with the States opportunities for their involvement in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protection of airspace</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important safeguard for the current and future operation of airports is established in the bill through provisions covering the protection of airspace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that a declaration of prescribed airspace can be made in the interests of safety, efficiency or regularity of air transport operations. Approvals will be required for activities which would result in objects intruding into prescribed airspace. The bill also allows regulations to be made which require a person to advise the airport operator of any proposed intrusion into prescribed airspace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Slot allocation and demand management</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's preference, wherever possible, is for the industry to voluntarily and cooperatively deal with emerging pressures for access to airports. Post leasing, airport operators will have the ability to set the terms and conditions of access to their airports, subject to ACCC price oversight arrangements and other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However given the 50 year duration of the airport leases, difficulties may arise that cannot be addressed by industry alone. Therefore the Commonwealth will retain reserve powers over demand management at airports. The bill includes specific provisions on the ways in which such powers would be used. Those provisions and any potential impact on the financial viability of airport companies would be considered by the Government in exercising these powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the bill there is certainly ample provision for the airport operator, users, Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the public to express their views on airport capacity matters prior to the introduction of such a demand management scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, under the bill, any proposed use of demand management powers is subject to review and disallowance by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes further provisions which establish a series of checks and balances on the Government and potential airport operators. These include the granting of injunctions by the Federal Court relating to contraventions of the legislation, prosecutions, false or misleading statements or records, review of decisions, delegation of powers and the making of regulations. In addition, most decision making powers in the bill are subject to parliamentary and administrative review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation allows for much of the fine detail of the regulatory arrangements to be set out in regulations. This is considered appropriate in view of the changing circumstances the Airports Bill  needs to address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing the regulations required, the Government will maintain the successful consultative approach used to develop the arrangements proposed in this bill. This process is appropriate given the wide range of interests including the travelling public, the airline industry, airport operators, potential investors, State, Territory and local governments, and the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our aim is to complete the necessary regulations well before the first leases are finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most major airports, both here and overseas, have traditionally been publicly owned and operated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to sell long term airport leases is a major policy initiative which the Government believes will further enhance the development of this vital part of Australia's transport infrastructure. The decision is founded on sound economic principles and a sales strategy designed to maximise taxpayer returns. By contrast, the Opposition's proposed amendments would be operationally and economically disastrous. They are nothing short of economic voodooism and cannot be taken seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overseas experience has demonstrated that, despite the high level of public interest in airport operations, with appropriate regulatory oversight the Government no longer needs to manage the commercial operation of airports. By ensuring continuing Government control over key functions, as this bill has, no area of public interest that can be compromised by commercial considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Post leasing, the Commonwealth's former role will certainly be transformed. The new focus will be on regulatory requirements, including pricing oversight and quality of service monitoring. This is consistent with the thrust of so many micro-economic reforms the Government has undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory arrangements which I have outlined will provide a full range of public interest protections. They will maintain all existing arrangements vital to protecting the public. They represent a significant step forward, breaking new ground in ensuring the orderly development of airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overseas Governments have and will continue to look closely at Australia's leasing and regulatory experience. Until recently, it has been an excellent process. Regrettably the Opposition is now seeking to delay its implementation for cynical political considerations. In the process, they are greatly inconveniencing a number of large foreign and domestic investors, many of whom have spent millions preparing their bids. We would urge the Opposition to desist and abandon their economically nonsensical approach to this leasing debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is joined by most objective commentators in the belief that this bill achieves an appropriate balance between the need to regulate airports, and the desire to promote innovative, service orientated, world leading airport operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AIRPORTS (TRANSITIONAL) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to the government's decision to sell the long-term leases over the airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation under a two-phase sales process. A separate company will be formed for the purpose of holding a lease over each airport and relevant FAC staff will be transferred to the new company. In the case of Sydney and Sydney West, the airport companies will have to be purchased by the same holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will provide a sound legislative basis to facilitate the leasehold sale of the major federal airports. The bill provides for: the transfer of airport land and associated assets from the FAC to the Commonwealth; the granting of leases over the airports and transfer of associated assets to individual airport companies; and the orderly treatment of the FAC's debts during the sales process. It also provides for airport staff currently employed by the FAC to transfer to the airport companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The companion bill, the Airports Bill 1995, establishes the regulatory framework to apply to the airports following their leasing. The regulatory provisions contained in the Airports Bill are necessary to ensure that airport users and the general community receive the maximum benefit from the improvements in the delivery of airport services under the leasing process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of airport infrastructure requires a large amount of capital and, for this reason, airports have traditionally been considered the responsibility of government. However, Australian capital markets are now sufficiently sophisticated to support the development of infrastructure such as airports. Given that public interest considerations can be protected through the regulatory framework of the Airports Bill, the need for continued Commonwealth investment in airports is no longer compelling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, through the involvement of superannuation and investment managers, the airports' leasing will provide an excellent opportunity for the funds of Australian men and women to be productively employed in the provision of national infrastructure. This is to the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to lease the airports rather than sell them under freehold title was motivated by the Government's desire to retain some control over the land on which the airports are located. The length of time for which these leases will be granted will ensure that sales proceeds are roughly equivalent to a sale under freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lease of the airports is expected to produce a significant net offset to outlays, with the majority of proceeds expected to be received in the 1996-97 financial year. The bill provides for a number of financial transactions necessary to facilitate and account for the leasing process and to allow for the orderly disposal of the FAC's assets. It is expected that these transactions will be Budget neutral. As has previously been the practice, the government is not able to reveal details of estimated proceeds from leasing the airports as this would in all likelihood influence the outcome of the process and would probably see a reduction in proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill now before the House contains a number of measures designed to facilitate the leasing of the federal airports. Under the bill, the land and associated assets currently held by the FAC will be transferred to the Commonwealth. Once the airport land and associated assets have been revested in the Commonwealth, the bill provides for the Commonwealth to grant a lease over the land at a particular airport to a company referred to as an airport lessee company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the proposed airport regulatory regime, these companies must have the status of constitutional corporations incorporated under Corporations Law. The bill enables the government to adopt a flexible leasing process involving either selling airport companies which already hold leases over the airports or granting airport leases to the airport companies following their sale. In either case, upon the granting of an airport lease, the FAC's contractual rights and obligations at each airport, as well as its liabilities, will be transferred to the relevant airport lessee company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is extremely important to the government that the jobs and entitlements of FAC staff are protected under the airport leasing process. The airports are therefore to be leased either with staff in place or with staff transferring to the relevant airport company immediately after leasing. Existing awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment will transmit to the airport lessee companies, which will ensure that airport staff retain key terms and conditions of employment as well as entitlements to accrued benefits post transfer. Following the transfer of staff, the terms and conditions of their employment, as contained in awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment, will be varied only according to the terms of those agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FAC Head Office will continue to oversee the management of the remaining federal airports prior to their leasing. Consideration will also be given to developing opportunities for head office involvement in airport activities, including the possible operation of airports to be leased in the second phase of the leasing process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the government's stance regarding payment of stamp duty in asset sales, the sale of shares in airport lessee companies or the sale of leases over the airports are to be subject to state and territory taxes and stamp duties. This will ensure that state and territory governments receive duties to which they are entitled on sales transactions which take place in their state or territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill does, however, contain some exemptions from state and territory taxes and stamp duties. These exemptions apply only to the those transactions required to structure an airport company for sale with an airport lease and associated assets in place. In this instance, the full value of the airport company will still be subject to state and territory taxes and stamp duties through the sale of shares in the company by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a tax perspective, the government is concerned to ensure that purchasers of airport leases and existing lessees under the FAC are not disadvantaged because of the government's choice of sales mechanism. Put another way, in terms of tax, the government is seeking, where appropriate, to treat the sale as if it was a sale by the FAC in the private market place. I refer the honourable members to the explanatory memorandum for details.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill now before the House contains provisions to permit the FAC to discharge its Commonwealth debt and to allow for the corporation's non-Commonwealth debts to be dealt with in an orderly manner during the leasing process. The provisions contained within the bill, coupled with the existing provisions in the FAC's statute, give the Government the flexibility to deal, in due course, with the corporation's debts in the most appropriate manner. The government can assure the honourable members that the interests of holders of the FAC's bonds will be taken into account in dealing with the FAC's debts during the sales process. The bill also facilitates the transactions necessary to ensure that the approach adopted for dealing with those debts is properly recorded in the Commonwealth's accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The airports to be disposed of in the second phase of the leasing process present specific regional and administrative issues which will need to be addressed prior to their lease. For example, the airports of Canberra, Darwin and Townsville are jointly operated by the FAC and the Department of Defence. As such, new operating arrangements will need to be developed with Defence before the civil facilities at these airports can be leased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although a number of the airports to be leased in the second phase have been unprofitable in the past, many of them are expected to become commercially viable under private ownership through cost reductions and improved revenues. For the remaining few that may prove to be commercially non-viable, the government will examine options for securing their future, taking into account the specific financial characteristics of each airport, as well as regional interests and sensitivities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks to provide a sound legislative basis for the leasehold sale of the federal airports and, in conjunction with the companion Airports Bill, is a key element in assisting the government to achieve its leasing objectives. The leasing of these airports represents another step forward in the government's continuing micro-economic reform agenda. The leasing framework will promote improved efficiency in the provision of airport services through the introduction of private sector disciplines, as well as ensuring that the government receives a fair return from divesting itself of a function in which its involvement is no longer essential. I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to proceed with my remarks on the Family Law Reform Bill 1992 (No. 2) and the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. I spoke last evening for a short time. I am pleased to have the opportunity to do so, Mr Acting Deputy President, while you are occupying the chair&mdash;having been the distinguished chairman of the committee which reported to the parliament in November 1992, which is the report being responded to by the government with these bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke last evening of my support and pleasure that the government had moved to remove the word custody from the bill in dealing with children. Also I did not mention last night, I do not think, but I equally approve of the change to the use of the word access. It is a word many of us became familiar with over a long period of time. It describes the right to enter and pass over a piece of land without hindrance. It also means access to one's children, as we have used it. The changes proposed will, over a period of time, bring more meaning to the act on what we are really intending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last evening I referred to the Child Support Agency and the formula which still needs to be addressed&mdash;and my disappointment that the government has shelved that&mdash;and the question of custody and access. I wanted to refer to the other issue that is very strong in the community and that relates to the position of grandparents to children who are the subject of a marriage which has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the most part grandparents are included in the ongoing arrangements, and it works to the benefit of the children. But in far too many cases we found in evidence before the committee&mdash;evidence that I think all of us receive in our electorate offices&mdash;that grandparents too frequently are cut off from the grandchildren that they have known in a way that indicates that it is being done for some reason other than in the best interests of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any children who have grandparents living would benefit from a good relationship with those grandparents. I could speak for the rest of the time available to me about why that is a benefit&mdash;the relationship that can develop between children and grandparents and the heritage of the family that can be passed on. In so many ways the relationship can help cover and deal with the trauma of the parents having divorced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view and, I think, the view of the committee that, in fact, the act provided for the role of grandparents to be recognised. But one cannot deny that all too frequently grandparents were excluded. One reason for this is the cost involved in bringing a matter before the court. Many grandparents would not have had the resources to enable them to do so. The way legal aid operates, it is most unlikely that grandparents would have qualified for legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One solution to that problem is that judges ask the question: what about grandparents? In granting the divorce, if there are children of the marriage, a judge is always doing so being satisfied that proper arrangements have been made for the children of the marriage. It seems open to a judge to say to the parties before him, `Are there any grandparents still living?' If there are, he is entitled to say, `What arrangements do you have to make sure that these children still have an ongoing relationship with their grandparents?' Perhaps in time when that happens, it will be much easier for grandparents to be included. Without spending more time on that issue, I welcome the addition of grandparents in the amendments that the government puts forward in this act, because if it helps to make it work better, then that is very worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the little time remaining to me, I want to comment on matters raised by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the absolutely extraordinary proposition which has been included in the bill before the Senate tonight on the location of children. The rest of it, I approve. We all know of the difficulties of locating children in many instances and the difficulties of putting things right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the end of the relevant section, which I think is 67P(1), I find, and the legal and constitutional affairs committee found, a penalty of imprisonment for two years for a register found to have intentionally or recklessly disclosed certain information. If it was done intentionally, he should be fired on the spot. So that would not be a real problem as far as I am concerned. But the concept of imprisonment in these circumstances does not seem to have been explained adequately in the act itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal and constitutional affairs committee found it to be an unacceptable penalty. They raise some real questions to which the government must, in the committee stage of the bill, answer if they wish to get any support for this proposition. I am not suggesting it is not a serious issue; but I do challenge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also share the concerns of the legal and constitutional affairs committee on the question of it being 21 days under a magistrate's suspension of a contact order for appeal. That is outrageous. I can imagine the way that would be used by a number of people who manipulate and interfere with contact with children. Three days, as the committee suggests, is plenty for that. I urge the government most strongly to reconsider its proposition of 21 days. I can see an order taken out every 21 days in some cases&mdash;and you have to remember that that sort of thing does occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still significant issues to be dealt with. But this bill goes a long way towards improving the act and I am glad that the government has responded to the committee's report as it has. We will support it, even if some of the proposals we are not happy with are not dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, it is quite interesting to see you sitting in the chair tonight, seeing that you were chairman of this committee. You will probably agree with some of the statements I will make, but I should never ask somebody sitting in the chair to agree with somebody in a debate&mdash;because you are very impartial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be an understatement to say though that the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 (No. 2) and the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995 have been a long time in the making. The cruelty of the delay is that many thousands of people have set such store in the passage of these bills that every week the bills have been dropped down the Senate agenda, those people have become further disillusioned with the parliamentary process and even more disenchanted with the politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In politics one always hopes to be remembered for some outstanding achievement. When I first started my quest for a family law committee to review the Family Law Act, I could have been forgiven for thinking I was achieving something worthwhile. Several years down the track, I believe that all I have achieved is a cruel hoax on the thousands of people who believed that changes to the Family Law Act would make their lives whole again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in reality the hundreds of hours and the millions of words that have been written about this legislation and these changes are simply not reflected in what amounts to some paltry changes to the family law. As a non-lawyer, it seemed ludicrous to me that one parent could deny the other access to their children&mdash;that one parent could so tie up the other in legal wrangles that they sent them broke or crippled them emotionally. As a farmer, it seemed absurd that a property in one family for generations could be rendered worthless and unworkable because a family law judge insisted that it be sold or split to satisfy the legal requirements of a property settlement to someone who might only have had a very brief involvement with the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family law act committee, as it is now known, was established with the highest of ideals and the noblest of intentions. The committee worked hard, processed mountains of evidence and digested, contemplated and determined a list of 120 recommendations, of which the overwhelming majority had the support of every political party. We could have been forgiven for thinking that that was the end of the matter, that the government would report, that the bills would be drawn up and the debate would soon follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I always cautioned people that the process would take a couple of years, I was certainly not prepared for the three years it would take from the time the report was tabled until it was debated in this chamber. It has taken a most circuitous route&mdash;from the Family Law Council so they could wash out a few recommendations; then to the government draftsman to fiddle with it; then with a few false starts and a few more sanitised washings from one legal body or another until the legislation we have before us today. While all this sanitising and study has gone on, the divorce rate in Australia has continued to climb; families have remained under increasing emotional trauma; and many separated couples have felt compelled to take their own lives and sometimes that of their spouses and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the report being tabled, over 733,000 divorces were granted under the 1976 family law bill. Since the report was tabled, another 196,580 divorces have been processed. Children involved in the divorce process now number in their millions, with nearly 800,000 since 1984. One in four Australian children is now born to an unmarried mother. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent statistics tell us that the Australian divorce rate is now at its highest. We used to have a failure rate of one in three marriages; today, it is four in every 10. About 70 per cent of all people who marry between the ages of 15 and 19 divorce within 10 years, and almost every male married in his teens is divorced within 20 years&mdash;frightening statistics. As a society we are failing our families and as legislators we are not responding to the needs of the community. There is much in this legislation we should acknowledge, but I cannot help but think there is so much more we ought to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible in the time allowed to argue each amendment, but there are some I wish to highlight and reflect upon. In passing, it is perhaps encouraging to note that, in the general outline in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, it suggests the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . makes amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 to commence the implementation of the Government's response to the Joint Select Committee Report.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill focuses largely on mediation and dispute resolution and also establishes a new approach to dealing with children. If one believes in the notion that all things are achievable through negotiation, then family law should be no different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court tells us that the number of contested divorces is quite small by comparison with the overall divorce statistic. Fifty-nine per cent of all divorces involve children and, last year alone, there were over 16,000 orders sought for custody or guardianship. While we can encourage mediation in preference to litigation, the reality is that if one does not wish to negotiate and mediate then there is no legal requirement to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has provided additional funding for mediation services. In 1994 the Family Court Counselling Service saw over 77,000 people and 1,500 interview interventions involving family violence. The annual report of the Family Court advises that the demand for counselling is steadily increasing, and that is good. But the fact remains that divorce is now more common than it was in 1975 when the Family Law Act first came into being. It is debatable that the system is any less traumatic. We still have as many angry, disenchanted people in the community, wanting and expecting us as politicians to do something. The longer the process of reform drags on, the increasingly lower credibility we all engender in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add to the list that the least respected people in the community are the family law judges themselves. The Family Court was set up to be a user friendly court, a legal process whereby people could come and understand and be understood. So the remarks made by the Chief Justice of the Family Court a few weeks ago on 20 September 1995 do no service to the court, to the judges or to the chief justice himself. In speaking at the second annual conference of the Family Court of Australia, Chief Justice Nicholson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a constant and persistent view pursued by people who are often discontented litigants, sometimes obviously dysfunctional, that the Court is in some sense designed by anti-family groups to destroy the institution of the family in society.</PARA>
<PARA>That is as offensive as it is judgmental. I might also add that he describes these groups as `anti-family'. Might I suggest that his remarks in support of same sex couples being recognised as a family and his claim that opposition to this view is `hysterical' and `suggestive of an increasingly authoritarian and repressive society' are as anti-family as one might possibly be. I believe the Family Court was set up to take the mumbo jumbo out of the law and make it understandable and fair to all. He went on to say in his speech this delightful quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An unfortunate concomitant of this approach is that some people and some politicians with limited knowledge of the issues involved, tend to latch on to such dysfunctional persons for apparent political gain.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not really appreciate that. I do not think it is befitting of the person who made the comment. What an outrageous and totally inappropriate comment for a man in charge of family law courts of this country to make. The arrogance of that statement defies comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would only add that this same man wrote to me when I was attempting to establish a parliamentary inquiry into family law suggesting that it was not the place of politicians and the parliament to delve into such complex issues as family law&mdash;his implicit suggestion being that we were not competent to do so. I do not think that is quite right either, because we had some very good people on our secretariat whom I think had a good, qualified chance of making this act better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only conclude that if this arrogance and total lack of understanding of common human values is indicative of the Family Court, then it is little wonder we have so much trouble with the law and it is of some surprise to me that we do not have even more. I can only hope that his inadequacies are compensated for by others more understanding of the real world and more in touch with modern families and the traumas that those people face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this same speech, Chief Justice Nicholson suggests that anyone espousing fathers' rights are irrational and not worth trying to talk to. I have had considerable dealings with fathers trying to get access orders to see their children upheld and I am constantly frustrated by the inexplicable lack of enforcement of orders. It was something that the family law committee heard time and time again. It was also referred to in several places in the committee's report. To now have the head of the Family Court dismiss these claims, suggesting they provide `little opportunity for rational discourse', indicates to me that the anger and discontent amongst lone parent groups about Justice Nicholson are well placed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary committee on family law is about to bring down its report on the administration of the Family Court, so I believe it is inappropriate for me to make any further comment about the actual operation of the court. However, very relevant to this bill before us now is the attitude of the judiciary. Justice Nicholson's remarks at the family law conference reflect the difficulties inherent in the system as the family law committee saw them when contemplating the act itself, so are pertinent to the bill we are debating here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In summary then, might I recap on the work of the family law committee and say that we deliberated long and hard on the Family Law Act and produced a document with 120 recommendations. The Family Law Council saw fit to accept only 79, or 66 per cent, of these recommendations. They disagreed with 17, qualified a further 16 and provided alternatives to another six. I reluctantly have to accept that the Family Law Council is probably more qualified than any group of parliamentarians. However, as elected representatives of the people, I believe we must listen to and reflect the views and opinions of those who seek our advice and intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the family law committee report&mdash;as, indeed, its subsequent report on child support&mdash;reflected community views and generally attempted to make better a system that is flawed, involving an issue that cannot be dealt with dispassionately. I am not persuaded of this current government's commitment to family law reform. I am in no doubt that the recent weekend comments by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) of a new commitment to a change in family law procedures will not hold much water with the many thousands of people who have dealings with the court; nor will they hold water with the literally dozens of people who write to me complaining of lack of access to the Attorney-General and lack of any appeals procedure to air their grievances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you ask any member of parliament what is the major issue for people who come through the doors of their offices in the electorates, I think they would say it is family law and the problems that people have with access, custody, parenting or visiting rights&mdash;or whatever you like to call them&mdash;in the new suggested bill. I believe this government has shown a consistent pattern of resistance to change in family law. This legislation is not much better than tinkering at the edges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's similar lack of response to changes in child support shows me and those involved in family law a government too intent on keeping the status quo. The current system has failed and this bill will not do nearly as much as is required to make the Family Law Act better able to act on behalf of the people in the community who have the sadness and worry of marriages breaking up. It does not happen always of their own volition, but because two people cannot get on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate this afternoon is discussing a couple of pieces of very important legislation that impact on the lives of many Australians. I am talking about the Family Law Act and the amendments proposed in both the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 and the Family Law Reform Bill (No. 2) 1994. I have had some involvement with the legislation that is in front of the chamber tonight. It started in March 1991 when the parliament established the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. I was elected to chair that committee of inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have said, we deliberated for some 18 or 20 months, taking evidence right around Australia. In November 1992 we presented a report to the parliament, a report that encompassed 120 recommendations for change and amendment. The majority of those recommendations were accepted by government after review by other bodies such as the Family Law Council of Australia. Since then, my involvement with the legislation has continued by virtue of my membership of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That committee has presented to the chamber two reports on that legislation. I have had involvement with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of interjection to Senator Brownhill, the previous speaker, I also said that I now have further involvement by virtue of the fact that my son and his wife had a baby girl some 23 months ago&mdash;her second birthday is coming up. So I have a real interest in another important amendment which the government intends to move to this bill. I might deal with that amendment first. I am particularly pleased that the government is willing to listen to the people. I stand here very publicly and claim credit for bringing that amendment about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was approached in Western Australia earlier in the year by a group then known as the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia. They wrote to me in my role as a member of parliament for the state of Western Australia, asking that we bring about amendments to the Family Law Act to recognise the role that grandparents play following the break-up of the marriage and the relationship. I met with the people and took their concerns to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee here in Canberra, suggesting to the committee that not only should we read the words of the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia, but we should also invite representatives of the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia to appear before the committee. Mr John Payne, the vice-president of the group and Mr Brian Lane, a member of the group, appeared before the committee here in Canberra on 6 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased with the evidence presented to the committee that night because it was so forceful that the committee accepted it and made recommendations almost in total accord with what the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia were putting forward. I am very pleased with that. I note in passing that the Grandparent Action Group have now changed their name to the Grandparent Support Group of Western Australia, I think a more appropriate name, and have continued to do good work in this area on behalf of their constituent groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with some disappointment that a number of organisations and certainly individuals are claiming credit for the amendments that are going to be moved, perhaps tomorrow, by government to accept the recommendations of the Grandparent Action Group. That is part of public life but it is there on the record that it was Mr John Payne and Mr Brian Lane who came from Western Australia to appear before the committee. The process has been very successful and it augurs well for the democratic processes in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that we have is not accepting each and every recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. It is, as I said, accepting most of them. Nobody can say that the government is acting by knee-jerk reaction to the report. The gestation period has been a long one. The fact that it is happening, though, has not stopped the public debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the previous speakers&mdash;I think it was Senator Reid&mdash;yesterday referred to an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on 1 October, a major spread entitled `Self service or blind justice?' It is three full pages together with another article in between. That is one of many articles&mdash;many of them misguided&mdash;that appear about the Family Court and the Family Law Act and how, as is said in one of the articles in the paper I have just mentioned, the Family Court fails to live up to the dream. Perhaps it was an impossible dream, because when any relationship breaks down, irrespective of how mature the people are who are involved in that breakdown, there will be some hurt, there probably will be some bitterness, and there sometimes is some anger and indeed some violence. Some of those matters have been addressed in the legislation that is before the chamber tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend just a moment in addressing articles such as the one on divorce that I have mentioned. The third page of the article has a photograph of the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Mr Alastair Nicholson. It talks about the Chief Justice having a high public profile and not being a person who shirks from controversy or from asking for more money to build up the empire that perhaps is now the Family Court of Australia. It certainly is growing, and it continues to grow. Indeed, the more it grows, it seems, the more demands are placed on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sooner or later, that growth is going to have to stop. The money has to come from somewhere, and it has to be raised in taxes. It is we, the politicians, who have got to go out there to the public and encourage them to give up their incomes in taxation, not the judges of the courts&mdash;not judges like Alastair Nicholson, who are high profile or non-high profile. If we, when we go out into the public arena, make public comment about matters of politics or policy, we are the ones who through the ballot box have to answer for our concerns&mdash;not lifetime judicial appointees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be better now if Mr Chief Justice Nicholson concentrated his efforts on the management of his court, which is now a very large court, rather than playing the role that people like myself are elected to play&mdash;being politicians. If he wants to get into the political arena, there is every opportunity for him to do so, but he should not hide behind the screen of judicial appointment and then criticise others who have the temerity to criticise him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Nicholson took the opportunity to have a crack at me in his speech at the second national Family Court of Australia conference at the Twin Waters Resort on Wednesday, 20 September 1995. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, I was publicly attacked in unfortunate personal terms by a Government Minister and by a senior member of the ruling Labour&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>spelt incorrectly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">party for having the temerity to suggest that some re-examination was needed of the policy of the Australian Government in relation to its policy of incarcerating people, and by people I mean families who arrive in Australia by boat without visas.</PARA>
<PARA>I did not criticise Chief Justice Alastair Nicholson for having the temerity to criticise the government; I criticised him for interfering, for going out into the public arena and drumming up business for his court. That is what I criticised him for&mdash;not for his temerity in doing it. The court has got quite sufficient work to do without the Chief Justice going out there to drum up other work for his organisation, for his empire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people do not believe me or do not accept what I am saying, I invite them to look at the 27-page speech that I have just quoted from, because in there again demands have been made upon government for additional resources for the Family Court of Australia. There may not be the need for those additional resources if all of the resources that are now available to the court were being used for what those resources were intended for; that is, the resolution of disputes in the Family Court arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Justice went on in his speech and talked about the hysterical reaction to his remarks. I would reject that in terms of my remarks, perhaps because I made them off the cuff in direct response to his; I had no pre-warning that they were coming. I do not accept that my remarks were hysterical. I have seen the minister's remarks, and I do not accept that they were hysterical either. I would suggest that perhaps the remarks contained in his speech, which were premeditated and prepared, verge on being hysterical. They serve no credit whatsoever to the Chief Justice, to the office that he holds or to the institution that he rules over in his position of Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the legislation that is before the chamber tonight. It has been a very long time in coming. It is the result, as I said in opening, of the government listening to the views of the community, and there were views that really spanned the spectrum. They were not only the views of hysterical fathers or, indeed, of hysterical mothers; they were not only male views or female views; they were a combination of every view that would abound in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bipartisan committee&mdash;the deputy chair of which, Mr Andrew Peacock, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, is no longer in the parliament, and members of the opposition parties, including Senator Spindler&mdash;combined together and worked long and hard over many hours, labouring to bring forward a report to parliament that, we thought, reflected the views of the community, of those people who went to the trouble of making a submission and appearing before the committee in the various hearings that we held not only in the major metropolitan cities of Australia but in some rural sectors as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, after the government had responded to the report some 12 months after its presentation, the legislation was then introduced. The legislation was then referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and that committee held a series of public hearings on the bill as well. I participated in one in Melbourne and another one here in Canberra. As I said earlier when I talked about the grandparents&mdash;I am now a grandparent and I understand how people feel&mdash;I welcome the government's attempts to facilitate the views that have been put forward, not only by the people from Western Australia but also from others who have since jumped on the bandwagon of looking after grandparents and giving a better recognition to their rights within the family law area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is indeed a welcome piece of legislation. I have some concerns about opposition comments on some aspects of the bill. The report that was put in and the recommendations that went with it, apart from two areas where Senator Spindler, on behalf of the Democrats, dissented, were unanimous. It is unfortunate to say that perhaps now there is a move away from some of those recommendations by sections of the opposition. I hope that that is not the case. I hope that the unanimity that was built through the development of the report is maintained in this legislation so that it can pass and be enacted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I feel that it is important to make some comments in the light of the tabling of 64 documents by the government. This bulk tabling is unnecessary and creates too great a burden on senators and their staff, who are finding it increasingly difficult to comment on the activities of government departments and agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key points I would like to make in this regard is that in a number of cases there is a large timelag between the receipt of the documents and their tabling. As all senators are aware, there are just two days during a sitting week when documents are tabled; that is, Tuesday and Wednesday. In the last three sitting weeks, there has been a fluctuating number of documents tabled. There does not appear to be a valid reason for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In week three, eight documents were tabled on 19 September, but no documents were tabled on 20 September. In week four, four documents were tabled on 26 September and only three were tabled on 27 September. In week five, there was an increase, with 19 documents tabled on 17 October and 25 treaties and six documents tabled on 18 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It only requires a cursory glance at the list of documents on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order of Business</EMPHASIS>, particularly at the dates on which they are received by the government, to see that this fluctuation in the number of documents being presented could have been prevented if the documents were tabled when they became available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the documents tabled today and last week have been available for some weeks and could have been tabled in weeks three and four. There would have been time available for proper scrutiny. I realise that this is a busy time for government, with departments and agencies producing their annual reports. The government could do a better job in managing this task. I know that the government will claim that many of these documents will be open to substantial scrutiny in the estimates process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it needs to be pointed out that the government's privatisation agenda is creating a larger number of government agencies which are unfortunately not subject to scrutiny in the estimates committees. As a consequence, the only opportunity for senators to comment on these documents is when they are tabled in the Senate. I therefore urge the government to examine the procedures for tabling documents in order that the Senate maintain its proper right to scrutinise and comment on the activities of these departments and agencies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I join Senator Margetts in her concern about the volume of documents that have been tabled today and are to be discussed in half an hour. Obviously there is no way that 64 documents could be dealt with in half an hour. I acknowledge and underline the point that Senator Margetts made, however, that the great bulk of these are annual reports, which can be dealt with in Senate estimates committees. I hope that that will be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, it raises questions about whether it is  appropriate to limit the tabling of documents to two days during the week and whether there should not be a change in the arrangements so that these documents can be dealt with in a better way. I acknowledge that on Thursdays much more time is put aside for dealing with accumulated documents. But it is unfortunate that the parliament, as a result of this procedure, comes a bad second to the media in terms of the capacity to discuss the content of these annual reports. The media, for example, tomorrow will have the opportunity of dealing with 64 reports, if it gets the time. We have no chance of commenting on 64 reports. When there are definite tabling requirement times for annual reports of departments and agencies, clearly there is pressure on the Senate to deal with them. We have to make some other suitable arrangements to cope with this peak reporting time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts raised another matter. There is a requirement for an explanation about the delays in getting to the chamber reports that have been ready for more than a month. For example, 6 September is listed as the date on which document No. 5, the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation annual report, was submitted to the minister. It is now 24 October. Why on earth has it taken the minister that amount of time to table in this chamber this report, particularly when, as Senator Margetts has pointed out, there have been some days when there have been very few reports? Why was that one not presented to this chamber? I believe that the minister has an obligation to let us know. If he does not respond to this request, I will certainly&mdash;I am sure that Senator Margetts will join me&mdash;require a suitable explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are others with some delays. For example, I am intrigued to know why the Royal Australian Mint annual report for 1994-95, which was presented to the minister on 19 September, is only just now being tabled. I do not know why the Qantas 1994 equal opportunity annual report should be coming forward now. That was presented to the minister on 6 September. It is now 24 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another gap intrigues me. The Australian National University annual report was presented to the minister on 28 September. But it was apparently only received by the minister on 16 October. I do not know why that kind of delay would have taken place. The Poultry Industry Assistance Act annual report for 1994-95 was presented to the minister on 19 September. It is only just being tabled now. The Australian Institute of Family Studies is listed as being presented on 4 October. Why would it take 20 days for that to come before us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters are of some substance. There are others, such as the National Sound and Film Archive report, where this kind of requirement about the date for submission has not been met. There are several of them where there is simply no indication of when they were submitted. There is the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee annual report and the Clean Food Marketing Australia Ltd annual report.

<PARA>This is a quite critical report. I rise to speak on it, particularly because last Friday Senator Meg Lees and I, along with our Senate lead candidate in Victoria, Lyn Allison, launched what the Australian Democrats are calling a river rescue. This was launched at a research centre on the Murray River near Albury, where we were the guests of the various scientists involved. We learnt a lot about the problems facing Australia in terms of its rivers and especially the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was that visit that highlighted for me the importance of this report but, far beyond the report, the critical importance of taking action to rescue our rivers. If we do not, then we will be faced with an environmental disaster of&mdash;major proportions is not a sufficient description of the crisis we face, but it is the best I can think of at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In launching this national environment initiative, the Democrats sought to highlight the threats to the country's vital river systems and to try to begin a process of detailing the solutions that would make a difference. We intend to do this over the next six months and to visit key places around Australia where there are problems with our river systems. In fact, almost all of our river systems have problems, but we intend to visit particularly the key centres and sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program that the Democrats are prepared to undertake is intended to help turn the tide against degradation of our waterways. We do not pretend that we can do that, but we do believe that, along with many other people of goodwill, political parties and other political figures, as well as scientists, who certainly are very concerned, together it is possible still to rescue our river systems. My colleague Senator Lees made this statement on Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be working with, consulting and supporting the many individuals, community groups and other bodies actively involved in water quality and management issues.</PARA>
<PARA>She further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We aim to identify both the positives and the negatives, to show where the gaps are and set out a plan of action that will make an immediate difference.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the positives, let me underline the positive contribution that scientists such as those that we met and talked to for some hours on Friday are making. I think what is lacking is not evidence, is not scientific research, is not the information to enable us to turn this problem around. What is really lacking is the political will. We intend to continue to press the government and the various agencies on this issue, particularly in respect of the Murray-Darling Basin. That is where the most obvious crises exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me, however, underline some of the problems. Every day this nation produces 50,000 tonnes of sewage and it takes five billion litres of fresh drinkable water per day to dispose of it. That is one of the problems facing the Murray-Darling Basin&mdash;not the whole 50,000 tonnes of sewage, of course, but a proportion of it. Every Australian uses 2,000 litres of water a day at home and at work. A high percentage of this use is for irrigation, which again has been highlighted as one of the issues that has to be addressed, particularly terms of the Murray-Darling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that land damage in the Murray-Darling Basin costs Australia $260 million a year in lost rural production.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to speak very briefly to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission annual report, simply to say that the problems in that basin are matters of major concern, particularly to those members of the opposition who represent this area in the lower house and who have expressed major concerns about the future of this basin, not only in terms of salination, but also water usage and pollution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, I want to say that there is a high level of cooperation between the states which are involved in this, and that that cooperation is essential for the future of this vital section of waterway. The problems that have emerged following the completion of the water audit as to what uses are to be made of the water according to the state governments involved, indicate that there is a huge demand for this water. As a result of that, the council, as the annual report says, has implemented an interim cap on further diversions of water while details of the permanent cap are to be resolved. Decisions on the permanent cap on water usage will be taken during the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report also reveals that irrigation management strategy programs have commenced in Sunraysia and Shepparton, and work is proceeding to develop projects in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. As the report says, a vital and responsive irrigation industry will be fundamental to the basin's future. Other matters being examined include a wetlands strategy, vegetation management, a community advisory committee and, of course, communication and education. In fact, the report notes that 30,000 primary school children participated in the commission's writing project, jointly sponsored by the Primary English Teaching Association, in the commission's program of continuing to support school education with a focus on providing up-to-date natural resource information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Water industry reform is also a matter of importance, as the report shows. Work is continuing to establish the River Murray assets on a more commercial footing, consistent with the reform agenda of the Council of Australian Governments. It is intended to have this work completed and fully implemented by 1 July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is recognition of the importance of burial sites at Lake Victoria where work has continued throughout the year to investigate the most appropriate method of ensuring the long-term protection of the burials. The area is regarded as one of the most significant sites in Australia, and a draft management plan has been completed and discussed with elders of the Barkindji community, and discussions continue.

<PARA>One of the great things that supports North Queensland, and in particular the potential for North Queensland to be a centre of excellence&mdash;and not just for Australia and the near Pacific&mdash;is research in marine science, and AIMS, of course, is a principal part of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate to recognise the work of AIMS because that work will have very long-term ramifications, not just for the protection of the environment but also potentially for the export of services. I should explain what I mean by that. The environment that we have on the Great Barrier Reef is unique in its scope. It is by far the largest living organism&mdash;I think that is one of the phrases that is used&mdash;in the world. But it is also a wonderful place in which to replicate a situation which is found in similar environments in the near Pacific. I refer to Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIMS is a world-class research facility that has the potential to export knowledge. As the near Pacific becomes more and more developed and the pressures on the environment increase in neighbouring countries, it will become necessary for those people to come to us and say, `You have the expertise. Tell us how we can protect our environment.' That is important for these nations in protecting fishing resources, coral reefs and marine ecosystems as a whole. All of that work will be valuable to them one day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will either be work for which they will be happy to pay or it will be expertise which we may choose to provide to them on an aid basis. That can only strengthen our position within the region. The work of AIMS should be considered in the broader context. I have always believed that there is enormous potential in North Queensland for regional development based on the export of services and expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be honest, in certain parts of North Queensland we are never going to have large amounts of industry because of the geographical limitations that cities such as Cairns face. But North Queensland has certain advantages which cannot be replicated elsewhere in Australia. That is why the work of AIMS is important and why I believe that the government needs to have a long-term strategy to maximise the benefits of that research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aid budget for this current year runs at something in the vicinity of $459 million to the near Pacific. When one considers that a large chunk of aid is over training, or is assistance in terms of managing the environment or particular problems that those countries have, AIMS could be a major source of assistance to that region. Instead of sending cash, we would have the opportunity to send expertise. I think honourable senators would well know this phrase: if you give somebody a fish you feed them for a day, but if you teach to fish you feed for life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider the very fragile marine ecosystem and the pressures on that marine ecosystem&mdash;particularly in terms of long-line fishing and the loss of fish populations through destruction of spawning grounds and so on&mdash;we see that we have a lot to offer. We can play a part in improving the lot of people in the near Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I believe that AIMS is very much underestimated. I take this opportunity to compliment those who work at AIMS and to bring to the attention of the Senate this first-class international research centre.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity, as I do every year, to congratulate the Australian Institute of Marine Science on its annual report. It is an organisation somewhat dear to my heart. I pass by its door almost every day when I am working in the north because it is situated midway between where I live and my principal office in North Queensland. It is an organisation that is very well-regarded world wide, and it is something of which North Queenslanders are very proud. They have adopted it as their own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from congratulating the institute on another good year, I want to mention a couple of other matters. I refer to the links that the institute has with industry and how it strives to ensure that its work is relevant to industry. There is a motive in that because the institute is at all times seeking additional funds. It does a tremendous job. It is very good to see that the institute and James Cook University in North Queensland work very closely together. They collaborate in a lot of their work and maximise the resources of both organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention the work that the institute is doing in the Fly River estuary as part of a major research project into mining activity in New Guinea. There has been a lot of concern about sediment in the estuary and the spread of river plumes and sediment into the Torres Strait and Australian waters. The data that the institute has used has been quite significant. The institute has received further recognition in the way of cohesive sediment dynamics. This sediment can be a major environmental problem for the Torres Strait area. I very much support the work that AIMS is doing to try and lessen the environmental problems that could be coming from the Ok Tedi mine. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight on the legislation in my state of Western Australia which is referred to as the first wave of industrial relations legislation enacted by the Court Liberal government. In doing so, I refer to the Workplace Agreement Act, the Minimum Conditions of Employment Act and the Industrial Relations Act. There has been a lack of critical examination of the first wave of changes in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will attempt to try to rectify that in coming weeks by providing some detailed experience of Western Australian workers under that legislation. I think it is important for this parliament to examine that experience because of the endorsement by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, of the first wave of IR legislation in Western Australia, his acceptance of the principles enunciated in that legislation and his comments that his federal legislation would be likely to pursue those same principles. When you compare the rhetoric with the reality of what is happening to Western Australian workers it is very informative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to a workplace agreement that is in force between Linfoot Cleaning Services and a number of its cleaners who work at TAFE colleges in Western Australia. Those workers were previously under the Contract Cleaners (Ministry of Education) Award 1990, but as part of the government's drive for privatisation the contract was let to Linfoot Cleaning Services. As I understand it, they now employ some 60 to 80 cleaners under individual contracts, which I will be referring to tonight. The number of jobs have been severely reduced as a result of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to the detail of the working conditions that now apply to those workers. The central issue I want to refer to is that the contracts classify all employees as casual even if they work up to 38 hours per week 52 weeks of the year. The Minimum Conditions of Employment Act provides that the only conditions that are applicable to casual workers employed under workplace agreements and defined as casual are the minimum wage rates and two days unpaid bereavement leave. They are not entitled to any other conditions laid down in the much vaunted Minimum Conditions of Employment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employees who previously were employed full- or part-time are now defined as casual and have lost all the standard employment conditions such as paid sick leave, annual leave, compassionate leave and access to unpaid maternity leave. By merely classifying them as casuals, the major conditions that the Court government has held out as being protected by the Minimum Conditions of Employment Act do not apply. What we are seeing in Western Australia is a whole range of full-time and part-time permanent employees being classified as casuals to ensure that they do not gain the protections of the Minimum Conditions of Employment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular agreement provides for an ordinary hourly rate of $11.10 per hour. That compares with the old award rate for a casual of $12.42 and for a full-time cleaner of $10.35 per hour. While at first glance this differential may seem inconsequential, their take-home pays are significantly affected under the workplace agreement by provisions which restrict or eliminate other award payments. These provisions reduce the actual additional payment and the circumstances in which it will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workplace agreement increases ordinary shift hours from eight per day on five days of the week to 12 per day on any day of the week. Workers' hours are to be arranged to suit the needs of the employer. In addition, the workplace agreement restricts penalty rates to only those hours between 10 p.m. and 4.30 a.m. All other hours of the day are considered ordinary time. Under the award, penalty rates were payable between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significantly longer `ordinary' and longer shifts all but eliminate penalty and overtime rates and significantly reduce workers' take-home pay. It is interesting that Linfoot has been able to roster its work force to avoid any penalty payments at all under this particular workplace agreement. Penalty rates are significantly reduced under the workplace agreement&mdash;and I will refer to that shortly. For low income earners such as cleaners, penalty rates have traditionally made up a significant part of their incomes and take-home pay. Under the award, the hourly rate on a Saturday for an adult was $15.53 and for a casual it was $18.63. For a person employed under the workplace agreement at Linfoot the rate is $13.90. I have done some wage comparisons and use these as examples only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A worker who I will call Ruby works Monday to Friday from 4.30 a.m. to 7.30 a.m. at one of the larger TAFE colleges. As a casual employee under the award she earned $200.35 per week. After signing the workplace agreement her wages reduced to $166.50 per week, representing a 17 per cent reduction in her income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Example two is that of a married couple who I will call Bob and Ingrid. They also work the early shift but are required to work from Wednesday to Sunday. Bob was a long-term, part-time employee earning $208.81 per week under the award. Ingrid was paid casual award rates which amounted on average to $250.62 per week. Under the workplace agreement both of them earn only $199.50 per week each, representing an eight per cent drop in Bob's income and a nearly 24 per cent drop in Ingrid's income. While Bob's weekly loss is smaller he has also lost all the standard employment benefits such as access to paid sick leave and paid annual leave which applied under his previous employment contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overtime payments under the award are required after eight hours work. The rate is generally time and half for the first two hours followed by double time thereafter. Higher rates are applicable on public holidays. Under the workplace agreement, overtime payments are not a requirement until more than 12 hours are worked in any one day. There is no overtime rate&mdash;it is paid at the same rate applying generally under the workplace agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard provision for paid public holidays for full-time and part-time employees is eliminated under the workplace agreement. While the award requires penalty payments for work on public holidays, under the workplace agreement public holidays are paid at ordinary time. Award allowances for such matters as toilet cleaning, meals during overtime, distant location, travel and so on are excluded completely from the workplace agreement. Allowances that were paid to workers had ranged from as little as $4 per week to $20 per week or more. They are all eliminated under the workplace agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workplace agreement further provides that wage rates are fixed for the duration of the seven-month agreement. There is no provision for review at the expiry of the agreement. The workplace agreement provides that it will continue to operate until it is replaced by a new agreement. Wage rates are fixed for as long as this may occur. There are no CPI adjustments and no productivity adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of other provisions such as termination, occupational health and safety, payment of wages and dispute resolution provisions which are all clearly inferior to those provided by the previous award and by private awards that apply in the area. The workplace agreement has been registered with the Workplace Agreements Commissioner but obviously access to that is restricted under the legislation. I am unable to ascertain just how many of the workers are on this workplace agreement because of the extreme secrecy provisions provided by the legislation. The Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union is currently seeking an interim federal award to try to override the workplace agreement and protect the working conditions of those employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one example of what is happening to workers in Western Australia under the first wave of industrial relations legislation that John Howard and the coalition have endorsed. It is clear that the claims that workers are protected from exploitation have not been realised. The experience of workers is sign or resign. Their conditions are downgraded by their lack of bargaining power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers are placed in the position of negotiating with their employer a contract similar to that which used to occur before conciliation and arbitration legislation was introduced into this country at the beginning of this century. We have turned the clock back 100 years. In the coming weeks I will provide the Senate with further information on a range of industries and detail what is happening on the ground to Western Australian workers&mdash;real people who are suffering under the Liberals' industrial relations policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to note that Senator Chris Evans chose to bring up the topic of Western Australia today. Of course, it was his valiant leader who endorsed a strike designed to cripple a state. I could go on about this at great length, however that is not the reason I rise tonight. I merely note in passing it is typical of the behaviour that we have seen in recent months from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address the fact that the Prime Minister of this country indulged over the weekend and at the end of last week in a most unbalanced, irrational attack on the superannuation funds. Honourable senators present will know that many of us have heard criticisms of the superannuation system, and Senator Spindler and I have shared many of those criticisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is thoroughly and utterly reprehensible for the leader of this nation to indulge in the sport of slurring people by calling them names and pretending that this is some sort of pretence to intelligence. If one is going to talk about people quaffing red wine, I note that that was a practice indulged in by members of the government about half an hour ago in their party room. I do not know if that qualifies them as donkeys, but certainly I do not think the Prime Minister is entitled to launch into the sort of attack he made on superannuation fund managers such as those at AMP without being subject to a bit of scrutiny as to why he made those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worthy of note that the event which precipitated Mr Keating's thoroughly irrational claims was the fact that the fund managers had finally had enough of the `leadership' that was being received by Coles Myer under the regime of Mr Solomon Lew. It is no secret that Mr Lew, Mr Kelty, who was not on the board, and Mr Fox, who is on the board, are all friends of Mr Keating. There is no reason to explain this intemperate attack other than the fact that the Prime Minister did not like the fact that the superannuation fund managers required a bit of financial and business propriety from the people who were running Coles Myer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler has been a frequent critic of business propriety in some of the major board companies in this country. He would accept the fact that the proper things not only must be done but also must be seen to be done. In Coles Myer there could be no doubt that there were real concerns about the standard of corporate governance in that company. What Mr Keating was saying when he abused the fund managers was this: the fund managers were donkeys because they would no longer allow Mr Solomon Lew to run the company in the fashion in which he had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that the Yannon transaction, which is one of the key issues in this whole saga, is alleged to have cost the shareholders of Coles Myer $18 million. So the Prime Minister is really saying that the superannuation fund managers whose responsibility it is to look after the financial interests of those superannuation fund members should turn a blind eye to possibly $18 million of rorting from the profit line of that company. That is the most absurd and ridiculous statement that I could possibly imagine a Prime Minister making, but that is behind what he has done and that is thoroughly reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, the Prime Minister, having realised he overstepped the mark, sent his troops in here and today we heard honourable senators from the government side saying that the Prime Minister was merely seeking to commence a debate about the superannuation industry and the future of the superannuation industry in this country. That is like saying Lizzie Borden was merely interested in doing people's nails or something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a ridiculous statement. The Prime Minister was thoroughly irrational in the comments he made. If this is the future for superannuation under the government, people should recognise that the Prime Minister would prefer fund managers to indulge his political favourites rather than expect good corporate management from the people who are entrusted with shareholders' funds. That is what Labor means by saying, `Trust us with your superannuation future.' All that a blind eye from the superannuation fund managers could have resulted in was a lower return to investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not about protecting the working class. This is not about protecting people's retirement nest egg. It is about protecting the vested interests of those who are close to the Prime Minister. I think it is a disgusting attack the Prime Minister has made. I believe he should be hauled over the coals for it. Let nobody in Australia be mistaken that the Prime Minister no longer has the interests of the people of Australia at heart; his interests are merely those of his privileged and powerful friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the appalling situation in Sri Lanka and to call on the Australian government to reject a one-sided interpretation of the violence in that country. It is an unfortunate fact that the news reaching the global community is dependent on the respective resources of the Sri Lankan government on the one hand and the Tamil community on the other. As a result, we have seen and heard a lot about the desperate efforts of the so-called Tamil liberation tigers to fight for freedom and self-determination of the Tamil community and the casualties caused by these forays, but we have heard very little about the atrocities committed by the government forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats deplore violence no matter who the perpetrators are. However, we also acknowledge that under the United Nations charter it is not only nations but peoples who are entitled to self-determination. It is important for us to be reminded of that today on this 50th anniversary of the United Nations. It is in consequence of these provisions that the Australian Democrats call on the United Nations to intervene in the tragic conflict in Sri Lanka and to assist in bringing about a solution which gives the Tamil community the degree of autonomy which is their right under the United Nations charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a first step, we are requesting the Australian government to intercede with the Sri Lankan government to stop its efforts to bring about a military solution, which is causing heavy casualties among the civilian population, and to lift its blockade to enable civilians to obtain medical supplies, food and other essential services. Most importantly, the Australian Democrats call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, to make a concerted and determined effort to get peace negotiations restarted with the assistance of the United Nations, preferably under United Nations sponsorship and supervision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about our Governor-General. I do not want to talk about him in the same terms I publicly spoke about earlier today. The Governor-General and his office, as indeed all Australians would be aware because of the extensive media coverage, have been under some pretty severe attacks over the last week or so. It started with an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> which commented upon the annual report of the Governor-General's office, which was presented in this place some time last week. Some of the headlines rang: `Hayden on the mat', `Words returned to haunt Hayden', `Pressure on Hayden to explain $10 million bill', `Why is it time to query the bill?', and `Hayden reboosts his New York workload'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the criticisms made, I believe, were quite legit. I am one of the people who have been critical in the past of some of what I consider to be the extravagances of the office. You would recall, Mr President, that I raised in the Labor Party caucus the cost of the trip to Gallipoli earlier this year. Some explanation has been offered on that. The current comment is going over the top and could be described as a pretty low attack on a very prominent individual and holder of a very high office in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in particular to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> of last Saturday, 21 October, in which the columnist Marcus Casey, under the heading `Bill and Dallas relax into holiday', had a go at the Governor-General and his wife whilst they were on holidays. I contend in this place and will contend publicly that whatever any public figure does when that public figure is on holidays is that individual's own business. If they choose to go off to Banff in Canada and have a relaxing holiday and stay at hotels reported to cost 1,500 bucks a night, that is their business; it is nobody else's business. If my wife and I choose to do that&mdash;we certainly wouldn't do it, although Jackie might encourage me&mdash;it is nobody else's business. If we wanted to engage in drinking red wine at what I consider to be an exorbitant cost, I do not believe that is the business of anybody in the Australian media or the Australian public, for that matter. It is not their business if that individual is on holiday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would defend the Governor-General's right to move to Vancouver, as was reported in the same paper on Monday of this week. He is reported to have stayed at a hotel in Vancouver costing $1,350 per night. The Governor-General, Mr Hayden, is reported to have said that he got that hotel for $800 a night. Good on him. If it saves him a quid, I am all for that too. I reiterate: it is nobody else's business what he does when he is on holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commentators who have jumped on the bandwagon and have blown this issue up ought to be condemned for doing that. Some of them have gone overboard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make one comment in regard to Mr Hayden's defence, which I heard on radio. He said it would have been inappropriate for him, while he was travelling overseas, to carry his own bags. I wholeheartedly agree with the Governor-General's comment that he should not have to do that. He should not, when he is leaving an aircraft and being greeted officially in another country, have his hands encumbered by baggage so that the host cannot properly greet him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the line and say there does not need to be a private aircraft to avoid that occurring. Like other members of this parliament, I have travelled on official delegations. In fact, I led one. When I had to leave the aircraft to be officially greeted, others in the party took care of the hand baggage. On one occasion, all members of the delegation had their hands free to be greeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), whenever it is appropriate, travels on commercial aircraft. Earlier this year when he went to Japan, a very important trading partner of ours, he travelled commercially. He did not need to haul out either the small RAAF aircraft or the larger one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard with great delight yesterday that the Queen, in her forthcoming visit to New Zealand, is going to acquiesce with the wishes of the New Zealand government and save them close on $1 million by travelling on a commercial aircraft to New Zealand. It can be done if the will is there. The Queen is certainly proving that. The Prime Minister has proved it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Governor-General, in the short time that he has left in that office prior to retirement, if he is to travel overseas any more, could practise that if it is appropriate. It may not be appropriate in all instances. It may be that there is a need to use a RAAF plane to get into inaccessible places on the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the comments that have been made have been very unfortunate and damaging not only to the individual who has served Australia very well over the years but also to the high office that he holds. Some people have sought to damage what might be a presidential position at some time in the future by their comments on this occasion. I hope that in the future the analysis that takes place on matters like the cost of overseas travel is a little better researched than what we have seen in the last week or so in our media. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the thrust of Senator McKiernan's comments about the Governor-General. I do so, having been one who did not support his initial appointment. I say that quite clearly. However, I believe his performance in that job and that of Dallas, his wife, have been outstanding. He has performed his duties with dignity and with the common touch that is alleged in some of those articles he has abandoned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not discovered any evidence to support the view that Bill Hayden has been anything other than a decent Australian, doing a good job in his role, which is, quite frankly, a fairly delicate one in view of the present debate about the role of the head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think he was quite unfairly criticised over the Gallipoli issue, in terms of whether or not he should have used the aircraft that is there&mdash;it is the government aircraft; it is the 707 that is being maintained by the government; and if it is not being used it is sitting on an airstrip. Sure, there are costs involved in running it. I thought it was appropriate that an effective head of state, going to a whole range of locations as he was on that trip, was quite properly advised to take the VIP fleet's 707. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was unfairly criticised for the muck-up in the arrangements at Gallipoli. It was not his fault that, because the President of Turkey was there at a time when there were threats on his life, security was so tight that unfortunate mistakes were made which delayed two important ceremonies. That was unfortunate. It was grossly improper to blame the Governor-General for what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to declare an interest in this. I have enjoyed the hospitality of the Governor-General at Government House. There is genuinely a much more egalitarian approach adopted by Mr Hayden and Dallas Hayden at Government House than there may have been in the past. There is still a requirement for a level of dignity to be maintained. I have no problem whatsoever with the manner in which he has undertaken his duties. I commend him for it. I regret that there was this kind of publicity towards the end of what has been a very successful term as Governor-General in difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not what I want to talk about tonight. I am glad I had the opportunity of following Senator McKiernan. I want to talk about a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> about a company. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police has launched an investigation into a suspected attempt to defraud the Government's overseas aid agency, AusAID, of up to $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An AFP spokeswoman yesterday confirmed the Government had asked the AFP to investigate an Australian company in relation to the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AusAID asked the AFP to investigate the matter last month after the company billed AusAID for allegedly false expenses of up to $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company told AusAID it spent the money to establish a research and training centre in Indonesia as part of a 1994 agreement with AusAID.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, AusAID referred the company's claim to its auditor in May after the majority of the claimed project costs could not be substantiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further investigation by AusAID's auditor revealed that software claimed to have been supplied to the company by another Australian company was never supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investigations by AusAID officers in Indonesia also revealed that three organisations named by the company as being suppliers or associated with the project had neither supplied goods nor had any association with the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the serious deficiencies revealed in the audit, AusAID last month requested that the AFP investigate the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An AFP team is expected to travel to Indonesia soon to pursue its inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A spokesman for the Minister for Development, Co-operation, Mr Bilney, yesterday declined to comment on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason that is of some concern to me is that I understand the company is the Indonesia-Australia Scientific Consortium and that it is effectively owned by a Mr Laurens Fluitman. The reason that causes me concern is that I raised in, I think, August of last year&mdash;well over a year ago&mdash;the extraordinary contract that Mr Fluitman had with the Department of Defence, which has now been referred to the Australian Federal Police, as the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) indicated in estimates hearings earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several things that concern me about this. Firstly, I can find no evidence of any contract or any arrangements with the Indonesia-Australia Scientific Consortium in the latest report of AusAID, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business participation in AusAID's aid programs 1994-95</EMPHASIS>, which lists not simply those projects in the current financial year, but more recent ones as well. I can see no indication of this contract which has been referred to the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also am concerned that Mr Fluitman had also, I understood, put in an application relating to the Development Import Finance Facility-Export Finance and Insurance Corporation mixed credit scheme. I do not know to what extent this application has been rejected or what state it is in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern stems from the fact that the matters I raised about Mr Fluitman were on the public record as of August last year. I am just wondering whether there is any effective mechanism by which one Australian agency which is concerned about various matters fully advises other Australian agencies of that concern. For example, I am aware of the fact, because I read it in the newspaper, that the Department of Defence ignored warnings by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service not to pay Mr Fluitman's company the money involved in its contract to obtain sensitive information about Indonesia's defence industry. Once again it is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper which has taken a great interest in these matters&mdash;and quite properly. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASIS warning, contained in secret cables sent from Jakarta in 1993, raises further questions about why the department went ahead with the deal, which is the subject of an investigation by the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA>I should interpose now that I do hope that the restructuring involved in the Australian Federal Police is not limiting or inhibiting in any way the police inquiries into the matters I raised in August of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was advised by the minister and by the department on 23 June 1995 at Senate estimate hearings that the AFP commenced their investigations on 11 May this year into matters that the Inspector-General of Defence referred to the Federal Police in accordance with standing arrangements under a memorandum of agreement and that they were potentially criminal matters. I do hope that more notice is taken by government agencies of things like ASIS reports saying, `Don't do it'. I found it extraordinary that the Department of Defence, having been told it was inappropriate and unnecessary to pay a private company to do the work, continued to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Mr Fluitman, by the way, recently denied in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that he and his company had done anything wrong. He attacked me for revealing the facts about his company and said that he had not been interviewed by the police, which I believe is not right. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
