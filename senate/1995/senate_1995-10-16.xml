<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This is totally over the top, if I might suggest. Today the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) has come in and said that he is going to be away for the next fortnight, bar one day. Forget the parliament, forget the responsibilities of the government and ministers to this parliament because he has better things to do. He wants to go to Colombia to a meeting of the non-aligned movement. You might ask these days what is the significance of the non-aligned movement internationally. But the practice of the government always was, Senator Ray, that it sent the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to meetings of the non-aligned movement. Why does the foreign minister have to go to Colombia as a priority ahead of his responsibilities to this parliament?</PARA></TALK.START>

This minister puts his other activities ahead of that responsibility and for that I think he should be condemned. Apart from his role as Leader of the Government in this place, there are a number of important issues on foreign policy before us at the moment. There is the issue of the East Timorese that he has brought into the public debate. That is a matter that is going to be pursued within this parliament during the course of this week. And where is he going to be? He is going to be on the plane to Colombia!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I support Senator Hill's comments. I cannot recall previously criticising ministerial leave arrangements but I believe these are unreasonable. For the first 2 1/2 years that Senator Evans combined the important roles of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Government in the Senate he was rarely absent. He almost killed himself in the process but he took both jobs very seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But given, Minister, that you have just missed, I think, almost two weeks of the last sitting, and given that, as Senator Hill said, there are very important foreign affairs issues on the national agenda, and without any reflection on Senator Ray in representing you, we would prefer and we have a right to ask you as the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be here. I believe that you should be here. I believe that it is by choice that you are juggling these two important responsibilities and you need to give equal weight to your role of Leader of the Government in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am deeply touched by the concern that has been expressed around the chamber for my presence here. I have been conscious in the past, as Senator Kernot has said, of the extreme desirability of being here. I do not think anyone has had any criticism in the past of the extent to which I have torn myself apart in trying to get back from overseas trips in time to be here at session times. I did not bother to produce the statistics on this occasion but I am happy to do so if it has become an issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular reason why I am going back overseas again is simply the extraordinary significance this year of these particular meetings given Australia's candidacy for the United Nations Security Council&mdash;point one; and, point two, the necessity for us to make the maximum possible effort to extract the maximum possible support for the nuclear testing resolution now before the United Nations. When I was in New York the week before last, in a period of 6 1/2 days I spoke to over 70 foreign ministerial colleagues. There are 185 members of the United Nations, so there are still quite a few more to go. My colleagues are intensely concentrated on occasions like the non-aligned movement. It is true that for a number of years I have not been to a non-aligned summit and would not have been doing so this year had it not been for the combination of issues that we are presently pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extraordinarily productive occasion, as will be the 50th anniversary session of the UN starting next week. If I make any kind of an effort to be there for the 50th anniversary session, there is no point in trying to come home before the end of the week because I could not be here before Friday morning, accordingly, I am also staying in New York, as I indicated, to attend the meeting of the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict which takes place on Thursday and Friday next week. I am sorry but I am also going to the University of Louisville to accept the prize of $US150,000&mdash;$A200,000&mdash;which has been given to me and which I am about to fork out for scholarships and things of that kind on the subject of ideas for improving world order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that under the circumstances the trip is perfectly explicable. The main point of the trip is the point that I have described. If Senator Alston or Senator Hill think that they can make any difference, or that Alexander Downer&mdash;God help us, that galumphing fathead&mdash;can make any difference to the way in which we are regarded internationally, they should be sent there too, to assist in this national effort that we are embarked upon at the moment. I frankly do not think that there is anyone who can do quite the sort of job that I can do, simply because of my knowledge of the people concerned and the personal relationships that I have built up over this particular period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the truth of the matter. It depends a lot on who you know and the circumstances in which you can relate to people by virtue of long association with them. There are many, many people who need to be spoken to concerning these important objectives and I think it is extremely churlish that the opposition and the Democrats should have taken the view that they have on this occasion. It just reinforces me in my view of this place, Mr President. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I think Senator Gareth Evans's last comment said it all. Ever since he made that fatal mistake and decided to go and have a run in Holt, and then found when he was out of the country that Senator Robert Ray actually moved in and insisted that the vote for the deputy prime ministership be brought on in his absence, he has known he is going nowhere in this country, and that is why he wants to get out. Even when Senator Button was leader, and he was pretty much asleep on his feet for the last couple of years, he was always prepared to be here. And you were too; you used to take this place seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing you can say about Senator Gareth Evans it is that he has always had an infatuation with the United Nations. He has always thought it was tremendously important. Presumably he still has the same view. But that did not stop him from attending to his duties for some years. It just happens that, all of a sudden, everything is so important over there; nothing is important here any more. We know that the Prime Minister is going feral because he thinks there is something important happening here but, when you have someone who is so disengaged from domestic politics that he can regard tripping around the world as the best way in which he can make a contribution, it really tells you what his priorities are. In other words, he has given up here; he is not interested in domestic politics any more&mdash;he is making a run overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he has a department to support him, presumably they can do all of the work, they can make the representations. We have ambassadors around the world; we have a permanent representative to the United Nations. All these things can be done by others, otherwise, why would we ever have a foreign minister attending the parliament? He would always be doing those fundamentally important things that are so interesting to him offshore. But no; the fact is, when you look at his track record, he has had less and less interest in this place ever since he lost out. What he is basically doing&mdash;as Senator Cook did before the last election, in that case in relation to the ILO&mdash;is putting in his job application. He is going around watering it, seeing if he can drum up a bit of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the way to represent Australia's interests. They see through you; they want people who are focused on the job in hand, which is representing the national interest. We want someone here who is going to be directly responsible. You are being paid real money to account to this parliament. You are not here when it suits you; when, because you feel like doing something, you will call in here occasionally. You are not honouring your responsibilities to this parliament, and I think you ought to stand condemned by your colleagues as much as by the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not much point; you are not going to be here for the next fortnight. My question concerns the rise to 8.5 per cent of unemployed in this country after 14 years of Labor government, and also reports today of Access Economics that the unemployment rate is expected to top nine per cent next year&mdash;in other words, rising again. Minister, is this not predictable, given that economic growth has now fallen below the figure which your government said was necessary to sustain ongoing falls in the unemployment rate? How do you justify this policy failure which is contributing to the development of an underclass of Australians left without hope of a better tomorrow, or is it just, as Mr Keating said on Saturday, that Labor governments are good for the wealthy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1777" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, there are several erroneous assumptions that Senator Hill has supported in framing his questions before he got to his questions. Let me correct a couple of them before I go to the actual questions he has put. The first one is about an assumption he made regarding Access Economics. Access Economics is one forecasting organisation in the private sector. It is one of many forecasting organisations in the private sector. On this occasion its forecasts do not agree with the official forecasts of Treasury, nor do they agree with the forecasts of several other forecasting agencies in the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you one example. BIS Shrapnel, publishing its report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> about six weeks ago, said that Australia looks forward to six years of continuous, sustainable economic growth. That is not what Access Economics has said. If you compare the track record of Access Economics to the actual outcomes on their forecasts, you will see that they have been wildly off the point as well. So that is one of the pillars on which you have based this question, Senator Hill. You ought to go back and re-examine the performance and the facts, because it is not a reliable pillar. I throw in as well the comment that it was Access Economics that worked with the Liberal Party to bring down the GST in Australia and the Fightback package. That proved a dismal failure. I would not rely on it if I were you, Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is in terms of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. In March 1983, when Labor came to power, there were more than 158,000 young people looking for full-time work. Now the number of teenagers looking for full-time work is at its lowest since April 1990. In September, it fell by 2,000 to 88,500. In other words, at the moment there are 88,500 teenagers looking for work. When we came to power in 1983, there were 158,000 teenagers looking for work. That is nearly 80 per cent more under you, when John Howard was the Treasurer of Australia, than under us at the present time. So don't you come in here lecturing us about economic performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I make is that we have an accord in Australia with the trade union movement. We have been able to reduce taxes, lift the level of the social wage and provide an economic safety net for those who are in positions where they cannot defend themselves, are out of work or are in some other circumstance. You have never done that; we have done that. That is part of what protects Australia and prevents the formation of an underclass. Your whole policy, your list of things that you will not do&mdash;provided by Mr Howard to ACOSS&mdash;do not stack up with the things that you will do when you talk to other audiences. Would the real Mr Howard please stand up? You can lie to one group and lie to another group, but sooner or later the lies catch up with you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic policies that this government has embarked on through Working Nation&mdash;to provide training opportunities and to provide employment incentives for young people and for long-term unemployed&mdash;are regarded in the Western world as a model of economic policies. It is what the United States Secretary of Labour, Robert Reich, has referred to as missing in the United States but present here and a model for the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of unemployment is still uncomfortably high, and we sympathise with those in the situation of being unemployed. The question here is: which party or which government will fix it? The policies that we have will deliver about a five per cent level of unemployment within the grasp of the Australian economy by the year 2000. You do not have any policies. You have no policies whatsoever, and when asked to reveal them, you will not. Your credibility is shot to pieces, and on your record you have no legs to stand on at all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the minister either does not understand the facts or deliberately misleads. I ask him: doesn't he realise that the record of his accord, this accord we hear of so often, has actually been to reduce average weekly earnings in Australia and to produce 763,000 Australians still out of work? After nearly 14 years of Labor government, 763,000 Australians are out of work. Twenty-seven per cent of young people are seeking work, are out of work, and the figures are rising again. That is why my question was: what hope do you give for three-quarters of a million Australians who are out of work when your projected level of growth is going to be insufficient to reduce unemployment? Surely it must logically follow that there is no hope for these people. This legacy of unemployment of the new underclass that you have created will only continue if you maintain the same policy parameters that you have to date.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the opposition were last in power and when John Howard was Treasurer, youth unemployment was 80 per cent higher than it is now. If that is the record you want to go to the Australian people about, tell me about it. The economic policies of this government put the level of unemployment within the grasp of the Australian economy at about five per cent by the year 2000. We do not know your policies&mdash;other than that you will engage in the biggest union bashing exercise that this country has ever seen since Jobsback was released and take on the Western Australian government's second wave of industrial regulation, which is creating divisive industrial behaviour in that state and undercutting the ability of that state's economy to grow.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. Minister, you have just returned from a trip to Japan, where I understand there was discussion of the APEC agenda for Osaka. There has been considerable speculation in this country about the attitudes that Japan and Korea are taking in terms of working for an exclusion of agriculture from an APEC trade liberalisation program. Is this a response to the rural gerrymander within Japanese politics and the need for Liberal Democratic politicians to maintain the support of rice growers? In view of the importance of agricultural exports to the welfare of many Australians, particularly in rural communities, and those employed in industries, especially those relating to food, and given the power of Japan in APEC, could you advise the Senate on the prospects for achieving a comprehensive outcome at the forthcoming APEC meeting in Osaka, that is, an outcome that includes liberalisation of agricultural markets?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1779" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the opposition thinks that it is probably not a good idea that we go to Japan to try to solve this problem but I think most Australian farmers do. If you believed the sometimes fevered interpretations of the discussions that are going on in the lead-up to APEC, you would think there was a crisis every time there is a meeting that does not solve every element of the package we need to present at Osaka. That is far from true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process we are undertaking is a cumulative and a progressive one. There are not going to be any quick fixes, but we are making substantial progress. It is very important for the Australian people to realise, as Australian farmers and their organisations and the food industry and their representatives understand, that Australia currently faces a real labrynth of trade distorting quotas and subsidies as well as very high tariffs in the agricultural sectors of a number of APEC members. Each step we can take in rolling back these barriers through APEC will mean improved export returns for Australian producers and the Australian food industry and increased employment opportunities for workers in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the discussions which I have had in the last week it is my view that it is now almost certain that Australian agricultural and food exporters will secure some degree of new market opening as a result of the APEC free trade process. What is currently under way is the process of maximising these opportunities within the time frame set down by leaders at Bogor. You would expect&mdash;and I did put this to the ministers and others I met with in Japan and Korea, but particularly in the case of Senator Carr's question in Japan&mdash;Australia's case for comprehensiveness to be unqualified, undiluted. We put that position fairly clearly and forthrightly, publicly and privately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Japan recognises it has benefited greatly from an open international trading system and that this would hold true for liberalisation within APEC&mdash;that APEC is as much in Japan's interest as it is in Australia's. The leadership there are intelligent enough to understand that at least as well as we do and to want to have the opportunity of those benefits. Therefore, I expect that Japan will provide the necessary leadership in the remaining weeks leading up to the Osaka meeting. While a resolution of the comprehensiveness issue may need to be found by the leaders at their meeting in Osaka I think possibly even before that there are real prospects to bridge the gap between APEC members on comprehensiveness in a way which will not compromise the interests of Australian farmers. The government will, I can assure you, be keeping in close contact with Australian food and agricultural industries as well as other interested groups during the countdown to Osaka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With regard to the question that Senator Carr raised about the implications of the electoral gerrymander that has traditionally existed in Japanese politics and the capacity of it to distort priorities, the electoral system has been substantially changed and this will start to come into effect from the next election. But there is no doubt that over the last 40 years there has been a massive over-representation of agricultural interests in the parliament as a result of the electoral boundaries and the electoral system. This has reinforced other factors within the Japanese economy and the Japanese society, which has inhibited the process of agricultural reform and their preparedness to open up their markets, even though it is clearly in the interests of Japanese consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government has tended to put it fairly plainly to the public in Japan and to the politicians. It is our view that it is the obligation of government to try to deliver cheap, good quality food to citizens. We find it hard to understand governments with policies focused on providing expensive food and keeping out cheap, good quality products, including those from Australia. Overall, I think we have a good chance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer to explain the Prime Minister's statement on radio 3LO on 5 October that `The housing affordability index' is `very good now'. Isn't this at odds with Treasury, the Real Estate Institute, the Commonwealth Bank and Housing Industry Association indexes of housing affordability, which show a massive decline in home loan affordability under your Labor government? Given that, according to the REIA, home loan affordability is now 36 per cent lower than in March 1983, which index of housing affordability was the Prime Minister referring to on radio 3LO?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of housing affordability is a question I am very surprised that you in the opposition would want to open up in this place for the very reason that all of the comparisons refer to a record that flatters us and damns and condemn you. What the Prime Minister said about housing affordability is right. The main reason why there have been changes in housing affordability in the period of our government is that consumers have become more confident about the type of house they want and they now choose a house which is 19 per cent bigger in capacity and size than the house that they would have chosen under you. I can give you the figures in squares. The house that they now buy is 198 square metres, whereas the house that they bought in 1983 was 167 square metres. So, of course, the price is higher because it is a bigger house.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the answer is that people do take out bigger home loans now because the market is much more flexible.

Interest rates today in a growth economy are lower than they were in a recessed economy under John Howard. Anyone who knows anything about interest rates knows that in recession they fall and in growth they rise, but with a growth economy, they are now lower than they were in the recession period of John Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, interest rates from the Howard era applied now to the Australian house would mean a 30 per cent higher cost to Australian home buyers than currently is the case. In the Howard era banks rationed and regulated home loans and their interest rate was 12.5 per cent&mdash;but with a cocktail in order to fund part of it. This meant that the real cost was more like what the building societies were charging in the Howard era&mdash;13.9 per cent, which reflected real interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under us, they are much lower than that and you do not have all the cocktails. You have, in fact, true competition for housing loans. So you will now find that people can borrow not only from banks but also from new home loan agencies like Aussie Home Loans, the AMP Blue Line and a number of other sources as well. The cost of the loan in terms of the price you pay for borrowing money is now much lower than it was when you were in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, there is now a more innovative home loan products market. Fixed rates can be negotiated for up to five years. Those fixed rates are at amounts much lower, in many cases, than the variable home loan rate. If you shop around,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">even with the variable home loan rate&mdash;look at what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> magazine said about this in its most recent addition&mdash;you can save $35,464 on a $100,000 loan, which is the variation between the highest market rate and the lowest market rate available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a much more contestable loans market. This means that the price of money to buy the house is cheaper and that people buy and build bigger houses. The flexibility in a financial market has meant that they sometimes buy a car, put in a swimming pool, buy furniture or go on an overseas trip out of their home loan and do not have to finance that out of other loans from other sources at higher rates. All up, the cost of servicing a home loan, including the real value of the house, is larger today. However, Australian consumers buy  bigger houses because they have greater confidence in the economy and in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that someone has at least asked me a foreign affairs question after more than half of question time. I am perfectly happy to answer this question, as indeed I have been answering it all week even though it is Senator Bolkus's responsibility, because the arguments and the issues are really extremely straightforward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, there is no relationship whatsoever between the question of what country currently exercises sovereignty over Indonesia and who may be nationals of that country pursuant to dual nationality principles and whether or not someone who is a national or a citizen of Indonesia might not also be a national of Portugal by virtue of Portugal's prior sovereignty over that country. That is the only matter in issue: whether or not some, at least, of the nearly 1,400 East Timorese in Australia presently seeking asylum are to be regarded as Portuguese nationals by virtue of having been born in that country during the period when Portugal had sovereignty over it, and whether or not that nationality is enjoyed alongside the nationality which they unquestionably have, we would recognise, as Indonesian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just add in parentheses at this point that the advice that was given earlier this year to the RRT from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the effect that the people in question were Indonesian nationals was in response to a specific question that had arisen as to whether or not, by virtue of an argument that the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia was illegal, East Timorese were to be regarded as Portuguese and not as Indonesians at all. It was in response to that particular query that came forward that specific advice was given earlier this year that the people were to be regarded as Indonesian citizens, and that status was not affected in the way that had been claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever might be the point about that, the relevant question that has to be addressed is whether there is a dual nationality status available to these particular people and what follows from that. The important point to appreciate is that if someone does have dual nationality status as Portuguese as well as Indonesian, which seems likely to be the case for quite a number of these people, the responsibility of the person in question if they are unhappy with the situation in the first country&mdash;in this instance Indonesia&mdash;is to avail himself or herself of his or her other nationality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the refugee convention requires&mdash;someone who is unhappy with nationality A, argues that they are being persecuted and should enjoy refugee status, has a responsibility to avail themselves of their other nationality before seeking refugee status in any third country. Moreover, from Australia's point of view, as such a third country where that status is now being sought, we not only have no obligation to deal with those cases or to offer protection when Portuguese protection is available, but we also have a positive lack of capacity to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of the proper interpretation of the refugee convention and the relevant international law. If someone is able to avail themselves of another nationality which they possess by virtue of international law and, in particular, the law of that other country, then they cannot avail themselves of the refugee process in Australia. It is as simple and as straightforward as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therein lies the problem for those people who can avail themselves. Whether they can avail themselves is a mixed question of law and fact. That is what has to be resolved by the tribunal. What we have said is that those people who are not Portuguese nationals or who cannot for whatever other reason avail themselves of that nationality can then of course go before the refugee tribunal, and will do so, and have their cases assessed. We have also said that, whatever may be the situation about their Portuguese nationality or their capacity to go before the refugee tribunal, there are other discretionary avenues available for their admission to Australia anyway under humanitarian discretion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did say that this is a bizarre complaint. It is for two reasons. Firstly, this assistance is being provided to farmers who are in desperate need. The suggestion that they should forgo this help as a tax minimisation ploy would be laughable if the implications were not so serious and if the person making the suggestions was not such a senior member of the coalition's frontbench in terms of primary industry. Secondly, Mr Scott fails to mention that the only way that anyone who has received this assistance will have to pay income tax is if they have also received significant income from other sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAS interest rate subsidy is fully offset for tax purposes against interest rate expenses and the drought relief payment attracts a tax rebate. The government also ensures that farmers who may have a tax liability can arrange to have tax instalments taken out of the DRP before they receive it. The Australian Tax Office helps farmers work out their potential tax liability if they need that assistance. If some farmers' income is so high that they are paying income tax, this is good news and indicates that they are recovering from drought and that their income stream has recommenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Scott also complains that some farmers' Austudy entitlements have been reduced because their income has increased. Farm families receiving the DRP are excluded from the Austudy assets and income test for the time they are on drought relief payments&mdash;that is, for the period of the drought&mdash;and for a further six months after the drought revocation is officially lifted. This is a more generous arrangement than applies to other sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the government has provided millions of dollars of assistance to now between 10,000 and 11,000 farm families that were desperate for cash to support the family and assistance to meet interest repayments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do I think the salaries are high? Yes, I do, but I do understand that the salaries reflect the payment of salaries in a very highly paid sector of the economy&mdash;the Australian merchant banking sector. The salaries in that sector are universally high, and I think all are excessively high. The AIDC called on a private sector consultant to advise them as to what the appropriate going rate was. It received that report and, as a consequence of that report, fixed the salary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The salary is made up of a base salary with bonuses upon performance&mdash;and the bonuses are varied according to how the performance of the enterprise has gone&mdash;and, in the most recent period, a payment for retention allowance to senior executives. It is the retention allowance that pushes the salaries to a high level. The retention allowance was negotiated by the board of the AIDC upon receipt of two private sector consultants' reports as to the appropriate level of retention allowance for this industry, and as a consequence they set them when the two government members of the board were not present and the government had no knowledge of the level being set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knew that a retention allowance would be negotiated because it was related to maintaining one of the key assets of the AIDC.

As a consequence of the government's decision in the 1994-95 budget to sell down its 80 per cent shareholding in full, it was believed by us and by the board that, in order to retain the most senior executive staff, retention payments were necessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has declared nothing. What the government has declared is that we have a process in place, a process placed there by a law of this parliament. That process ensures that the process is independent of us and of the government, that people are treated individually and that people will be assessed for refugee status in accordance with the internationally accepted definition of `refugee'&mdash;that is, the UN definition of `refugee'&mdash;which has been in place for some 40 years now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In assessing these people, the Refugee Review Tribunal some seven or eight months ago, in February this year, raised the issue of nationality, raised the issue of citizenship and raised the issue for the government to consider whether the domestic law of Portugal would impact on these people's rights under the international definition of `refugee'. That is when it came up. The government did not trigger this exercise. This exercise was triggered by the RRT, independent of government, in its deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was asked to make submissions to the RRT for it to consider. Requests were made in February, June and July. Submissions have been made to the RRT on the particular point of nationality and citizenship. As you would know, Senator Chamarette, for some 40 years or so the internationally recognised definition of `refugee' has allowed for situations where people may have, as Senator Gareth Evans quite rightly said, duality of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of fairness, what that definition provides is that if someone does have the right to enter and to be protected by a country or more than one country, then he or she has to seek the protection of those countries before seeking asylum status anywhere else. I think that is something that Senator Chamarette full well appreciates. It is something that I must say was appreciated by the support groups with whom I met some four or five months ago in places like Darwin where this issue was raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, nothing has been raised by the government. The government has not interfered in the process. The relevant officers have responded to requests of the tribunal and that is how the matter has gone. I think the criticism, particularly last week of my colleague Senator Evans for interfering, is something based on no fact at all and has been totally unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just go to the second part of your question: what do we do with these people and do they qualify under the special assistance category? Raising that question, I think, is also important because not only has the government been prepared to treat people and assess them on a case by case, individual basis but it has also introduced a special humanitarian category to handle people from East Timor, whether they come through Macau or Portugal. In fact, it was only less than 12 months ago that I extended the operation of that humanitarian category and, as a consequence, increased the number of people entitled to come to Australia under it. I must admit that at that time I got criticised for so doing by the opposition; let me just place that on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That special assistance category operates with time lines. The time lines are there to ensure that we do not, for instance, use it as a backdoor migration program and that we do use it effectively as a special humanitarian program. My understanding is that the time lines will probably prevent people going into Portugal from accessing that, because I think their nominators have to be in Australia for a certain period and so on. But, Senator, I will take on board your question in respect of those time lines and see to what extent these people may be covered or not covered by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do stress that final point: we have not interfered; we will not interfere; and international laws will be applied. Not only will they be applied because we feel it is a good thing; they will be applied because section 36 of the Migration Act passed by this Senate ensures that the Refugee Review Tribunal has no capacity but to apply that law. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I am indeed fortunate to have chosen the one day in the sitting fortnight when Senator Evans will be here. I refer to the appointment of Mr Stephen Loosley as special envoy to five Middle East and southern Asian countries to lobby for Australia's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council. Mr Loosley's sole qualification for this position appears to be his former chairmanship of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee and four overseas parliamentary delegations. Why was no statement made announcing this appointment? Why is Mr Loosley a better qualified candidate for this position than the five ambassadors to those countries and the presumably vast numbers of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff with specialised expertise in this area? Is it not the case that this is just another example of nepotism in the Labor family?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point about special envoys is that they are not people normally accredited to the country in question, but they go there wearing some special hat to identify the significance of the particular message they are being tasked to convey. We have had a large number of people&mdash;some retired diplomats and some current diplomats&mdash;working in countries to which they are not accredited and so on, playing that particular role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been about a dozen of them in total going off to make these representations on behalf of me and the Prime Minister directly to the governments in question.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About a dozen, in total, envoys have made those visits to over 80 countries so far. Stephen Loosley was asked to be a special envoy in the Middle East and South Asia because of his earlier contacts with and experience in those regions in his former capacity, as Senator Troeth says, as chairman of the joint committee. He does have very valuable contacts in both parliament and government in Iran and India in particular. He was also an international election monitor in Nepal in 1991. Moreover, as you know in the opposition, because you have had occasion to congratulate him on his effectiveness in the role, he has been a very successful leader of all-party delegations to Russia in December 1993; to Bougainville&mdash;a particularly significant exercise&mdash;in April 1994; to Rwanda and other parts of Africa in January and February 1995; and to Vietnam in April 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the special envoy, he carried letters from Mr Keating to the President of Iran, and the Prime Minister of India and Nepal, and a letter to me from the foreign minister of Sri Lanka; he had a large number of other high level meetings and private discussions with President Rafsanjani in Iran and the Prime Ministers of Nepal and Sri Lanka; he also made a series of calls coinciding with a meeting of the Arab League in Cairo enabling him to meet with high officials of the league and the delegations from, among other countries, Kuwait, Comoros, Somalia and Saudi Arabia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms and conditions of his contract were the same as those for the other two non-departmental officers who have acted as special envoys. They have all been paid a travelling allowance of $300 a day in addition to a consultancy fee in the grand sum of $266 per day. Absolutely nobody in private enterprise would work for that amount&mdash;and nobody in the legal profession either, to my knowledge. It is equivalent to the fee that has been set by the Remuneration Tribunal for consultations at this level. It bears no resemblance to what is payable on the market for similar exercises of this kind.</PARA>

The first question is about foreign ownership and the ability to deliver services. The question about the ability of a company, foreign owned or domestically owned, to deliver health services in Australia goes to the right of the state health authorities&mdash;in this case the New South Wales and Western Australian health authorities&mdash;to licence that company to deliver those services to Australian quality standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So its ownership, whether it is foreign or domestic, is not relevant, I would suggest, to the question of whether this company is capable of delivering those services. It really is a question of whether it can meet the standards at the state level.

My advice is that both the FIRB and the Treasurer approved of it and that the investment was, in that sense, in order. Senator Spindler and I both know that we debate the question of foreign ownership regularly in this chamber. The Australian government has a view that foreign investment in Australia helps to grow the Australian economy and creates more jobs for other people. That is a process of economic management that Senator Spindler apparently disavows. Let us have that continuing argument as to who will be right and who will be wrong.

Can you explain the contradictions between your position and that of your colleague Senator Evans who boldly declared his support for the creation of a rapid deployment force in the United Nations General Assembly earlier this month?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans, of course, did nothing of the kind. My attitude to these particular questions can only be based on the experience of the United Nations involving itself at a military level. Those experiences have been mixed so far. There have been both successes and failures. Where there have been failures or weaknesses, various defence ministers and foreign ministers around the globe have looked at how best to address those. In broad principle, of course, we have said that, in terms of our own involvement, one must be absolutely certain that the mission is properly defined. One must make sure, especially if it is peace enforcement or peacekeeping, that there is a political solution in prospect. Thirdly, there should be at least a finite period for which forces are committed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made those views very clear, there have still been weaknesses exhibited in a variety of UN operations as to command and control and the way the UN can react with sufficient speed. The current difficulty is, if an emergency breaks out around the globe, a whole range of countries are approached to see whether they are able to respond. Not always can every country respond in the way the UN would like them to respond, Senator Newman. Therefore, some thought has been given to a consideration of whether the UN could possibly have its own forces; whether it could have designated forces available to them at their direction in a country; or whether there could be stand-by forces. If you like, they are the three broad alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first alternative is a very difficult one, in my view. It is very difficult because the United Nations for a start does not have an intelligence organisation on which most military commitments would have to rely and judgments be made. On the second issue, I think there would be very few countries around the globe that would give up their sovereignty on issues that would have their own forces being able to be committed by an international body. So the area Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;and, to a lesser extent myself&mdash;and the Prime Minister have been working on is to give some support to the concept of stand-by forces where each country identifies what assets it thinks it can make available.</PARA>

I have made it very clear that, as far as I am concerned, we will not commit to areas such as Bosnia, or Afghanistan or other areas where we cannot operate effectively because of the nature of our forces. So I have not been in favour of a rapid deployment force under the control of the UN, mainly because of the practical difficulties associated.</PARA></TALK.START>

But what Senator Evans has especially been active on&mdash;and he can speak for himself, you can ask him a question&mdash;is trying to get the UN the necessary funds, the means to generate the funds, to have a proper involvement around the globe. So I do not think there is any dichotomy between Senator Evans's and my views on this. If there is, it is only at the edges, and that is what government is about&mdash;a conflict of ideas and views in which we eventually develop a government policy, and then all sides accept that as the final policy.</PARA>

The truth of the matter is quite otherwise; I completely endorse what Senator Ray has said. What I said in the UN a few days ago was this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Particular attention has been given recently to the question of improving the United Nation's rapid reaction capability, and I warmly commend the work that has been done to clarify our thinking on these issues by the Netherlands and Danish Governments, and particularly in the major Canadian report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a Rapid Reaction Capability for the United Nations</EMPHASIS>, just presented to the Assembly. The very useful emphasis of the Canadian study is on the idea of improving the UN system's capability at the centre first&mdash;particularly in the area of operational planning&mdash;and thereby encouraging greater willingness by troop contributors to give practical and more urgent effect to standby arrangements. No organisational arrangements will substitute for clear-eyed decision-making by the Security Council on the responses and mandates that are appropriate to particular situations, but the implementation of changes of this kind should make us much better equipped as an international community to deal in the future with situations like that in Rwanda, where last time our response was so tragically inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>There are important issues of principle here; important issues of practice at work here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now unequivocally of the view, after reading these reports and being involved in many discussions in many parts of the world, that the best way to proceed in the first instance is not by trying to create a separate force, either as a volunteer force or with a set of identified earmarking arrangements which would have people located in a particular place and available for this purpose.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Tambling this day, relating to housing affordability.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an important issue and, as I said at the time of the supplementary question, Senator Cook was obviously either avoiding the issue or not coming to grips with the reality of Labor's failing economic policies, particularly as they impact on young Australians seeking to secure&mdash;whether that is to buy or to rent&mdash;a home for the first time in Australia. Very obviously, the housing affordability indices of various bodies&mdash;whether it was the Real Estate Institute, which I cited, the Commonwealth Bank or the Housing Industry Association&mdash;all make it very clear that we do have a problem of major proportions for many and, in fact, just about all young people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Real Estate Institute index shows that housing affordability is now 36 per cent lower than in March 1983 really shows the Labor government's hand on this issue. I was appalled at the response by Senator Cook, who showed absolutely no sympathy for and no identification with young people in Australia. He waffled on about the increase in the size and standard of an average house today. He waffled on about increased areas of contribution. He talked about the costs and wages rising, but he did not put them in proportion to the cost of a house today compared with the increases in an average family's wage or salary or with the costs that they experience. It is that widening gap that is the major issue and threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the original question, this matter was raised by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on 5 October, when he said, `The housing affordability index is very good now.' That is a fine quote. It is an easy throwaway line on a radio station, but it really does have no connection whatsoever to the problems or to the identification. I hope people were listening at the time of that radio broadcast, which I think was in Melbourne with Peter Couchman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone seeking to purchase a house or rent a house would know that what the Prime Minister said on that occasion was nothing short of absolute hypocrisy. Here we have a Prime Minister who throws taxpayers' dollars around building carports at the Lodge that are more expensive than an average family home in Australia. We all know that Mr Keating has purchased a magnificent mansion for his own retirement in Woollahra at a cost of some $2 million. Senator Cook stands up and talks about the square metres of a house being increased marginally. There is no comparison with what Mr Keating is currently doing. If he is spending $2 million of his personal money&mdash;he has probably borrowed the whole lot of it under some fancy arrangement or deal&mdash;how does that compare to the position of a struggling family in the outer suburbs of Sydney or, in my case, in Darwin in the Northern Territory? How does the Prime Minister's reality compare? He says housing affordability is very good now. It is very good now for Mr Keating but it is not very good now for the average family seeking to secure a home, particularly those seeking to secure a home for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other issues related to housing affordability. The housing industry is in crisis. We have certainly seen a slump, not only in confidence but also in the whole construction industry. That impacts back to every family in Australia. Anyone who knows a young person seeking to be employed as an apprentice or a tradesman knows that it is just so much harder now to get work in industry because it is just not there. The economy is failing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whilst my question today sought more information on housing affordability, what that question flushed out of Senator Cook was the fact that this government had no knowledge whatsoever of how it was impacting on average families and young people throughout Australia, on their jobs and on their homes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Howard won himself a nice cheap little headline a few days ago when he said in a speech that real average monthly mortgage repayments have risen from $674 in 1983 to $951 in 1995. That was reflected in the equally cheap shots advanced by Senator Tambling today. The truth is that the increase of around 50 per cent in real monthly mortgage repayments since 1983, as claimed by Mr Howard, is more than accounted for by an increase of over 60 per cent in the real average loan size. The reason the real average loan size has gone up to the extent that it has is overwhelmingly because people have been buying bigger and better houses. You can attack Senator Cook for talking about square metres and so on but that is the truth of the matter: the increase in real average loan size reflects in the first instance an increase in real average house prices of over 30 per cent since 1983 as a result of bigger and better houses, with the average size of a new house increasing from 167 square metres in 1983-84 to 198 square metres in 1994-95, which is an increase of 18.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason for these figures showing up as they do is that there has been an increase in the loan to valuation ratio by about 20 per cent since the March quarter of 1983, which reflects the ability to obtain a greater proportion of the required finance from a low cost provider as compared&mdash;as Senator Cook again said in his answer&mdash;to the expensive cocktail financing that was the only way you could put these things together in the past. It also reflects the use of loans secured against housing to finance other expenditure, which has also become a much more common phenomenon in the community over the last 10 years. The truth of the matter&mdash;and it can never be gainsaid&mdash;is that mortgage interest rates, which are a major determinant of mortgage repayments obviously, have fallen sharply since 1983. Benchmark variable rates for major banks declined from 12 1/2 per cent in March 1983, and even higher at 13 1/2 per cent in December 1982, to 10 1/2 per cent in June 1995. There are plenty of finance providers, newer banks and mortgage brokers, as again Senator Cook said, who are prepared to substantially undercut these rates. That is the truth of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the position so far as overall housing affordability is concerned? The truth of the matter, when you cut out the political nonsense that Senator Tambling was going on with, is that housing affordability does remain at a high level, despite a fall which occurred last year, mainly reflecting increases at the time in mortgage interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in affordability last year followed more than three years of rising affordability, to a record peak in late 1983. Again, in 1995, the affordability index has improved. The index published by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Housing Industry Association rose by 2.3 per cent in the March quarter and fell back a little in June; but it does reflect stable interest rates and the continued increase in household incomes which have partly offset some increase in house prices. The basic point is and remains the fact that affordability is well above the levels of the late 1980s and is around 42 per cent above the trough in 1989. That is the situation, as the figures demonstrate and as is being experienced out there in the marketplace. Huffing and puffing by Senator Tambling or anyone else is not going to change that basic situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was intrigued to hear the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) in his last few remarks say that  the late 1980s was a standard for comparison. Let us remember who was in government in the late 1980s&mdash;it was Labor. Comparing a disaster under Labor with another disaster under Labor seems to me a curious way of trying to demonstrate that the Labor government has somehow achieved some great step forward. The fact is that, yes, more battlers in Australia are now finding it more and more difficult to pay off their houses. Certainly, for them&mdash;they are the people Labor has abandoned&mdash;housing affordability is now a disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that very clearly from recent media exposure of the gap between what people are owing on their houses and the value of the houses&mdash;the negative equity that so many Australians now face. They have borrowed more on their houses than their houses are now worth. This is a disastrous situation that is a direct result of this government's policies. For example, the media has quite properly revealed the enormity of this problem in the marginal seats of Macarthur and Gilmore in New South Wales. Let us consider houses that cost around $120,000. I know members of the Labor Party would not understand a house costing $120,000 when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) happily spends $250,000 on a carport at the Lodge&mdash;that is roughly two normal houses for the battlers of south-western Sydney. Naturally, those members do not understand the reality of the problem. This problem is a very serious one. Senator Evans can quote figures about the increase in the amounts of the loan; but that has brought about this sort of result. Yes, there are bigger loans on individual houses&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Tambling has interjected, there are bigger costs. The fact is that having a bigger loan as a percentage of the value of the house involves increasing risk to those people&mdash;those battlers&mdash;who, having gone into a house with a very high gearing, find that a small reduction in the marketplace wipes out their equity in their home. It is not just one individual location in one section of Sydney; it is throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Channel 9 demonstrated that, in Melbourne, these people&mdash;low income earners who had suffered either retrenchment or some other financial difficulty&mdash;were finding that they could not sell their homes because they would get so much less than the homes were worth. I think in one instance there was something like a $9,000 loss facing these people&mdash;the people the Labor Party is supposed to represent&mdash;if they were forced to sell their house even after having paid interest for some two, three or four years on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a disaster for the battlers' end of the housing market, for the people who desperately want to have their own houses and get out of the rental system but who simply cannot afford to now if they are looking at housing affordability in general or if they have made that exciting move into their own homes. They now find that because of the high borrowing they have undertaken and the fall in the housing market as a result of this government's policies, they owe more than their houses are worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect that the Labor Party will eventually wake up to this. It happens to be in almost every one of the marginal seats they just hold on to around Australia. Firstly, it is politically stupid of them to ignore this large group of battlers. Secondly, it is grossly unfair that their policies should hit the battlers of Australia, who are struggling to buy their own homes. They are the very people about whom the Liberal Party is concerned. As we will demonstrate when our policies are revealed, they will be protected against the sort of actions that the Labor Party has deliberately chosen to impose on them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the problems with housing that we have today is that people are playing politics in the housing industry and they do not appear to be telling the whole truth in relation to what is happening. It is quite obvious that larger houses are being built and that people are paying more for homes than before because of that increase in the size of homes. For instance, I know a couple of young battlers who started off by buying a house at $110,000 and who are now living in a house that is worth half a million dollars. The husband did very well in business and has paid for a house in that price vicinity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were battlers. Although Senator Herron does not believe it, there is an opportunity in this country for people to rise above where they are. This young lad did. He had a business, did very well at the business and moved himself into a $500,000 house. But that is not the point I am making. It is happening to a large number of people throughout the community. It is not just an isolated case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume said that battlers who encounter a problem when living in their home have to sell the house and that they cannot gain the valuation of the house or the amount of money that they borrowed against it. There has to be some responsibility in this in relation to the banks. Before you can get a loan, the first thing you have to do is go to the bank. The bank inspects the house and values it. It then decides whether it will lend you the money. You tell the bank that you have the deposit to meet the requirements, and you accept the loan that it offers you. Surely the banks have some responsibility if they are overvaluing the houses and people are taking larger loans than they should be. That is what is happening in lots of cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today you can borrow money to buy a house on a 10 per cent deposit. A few years ago, you could not do this; the banks were not competing as hard with one another. You would need 25 to 35 per cent or in some cases even up to 50 per cent of the amount of money that you wanted to borrow. On 10 per cent, you are now borrowing the balance of the money against the house. The bank values it. Surely the bank is not stupid enough to overvalue the house. For example, it will not say that the house is valued at $200,000, give you a $180,000 loan and then find later, when it goes to sell it, that the house is only valued at $115,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some responsibility in the housing industry. There is a responsibility in the recent actions of the banks when lending money to the battler for a house. Another consideration that has to be taken into account is that the amount of deposit that is being paid by people purchasing a house is much less. They now need a much smaller deposit than they needed years ago. Therefore, if they run into some problems, there is a greater risk to the self. Of course, the amount of interest they pay in the first two or three years does not pay very much off the principal. I think everyone here understands that the interest paid in the first two or three years hardly pays anything off the principal. So it is very difficult to return the money borrowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that is happening, which I think everyone also knows but no-one has mentioned, is that the building industry is starting to level out. The cost of housing and the cost of land has levelled out. It has not moved to the extent it was moving. Now the government has inflation under control I do not believe that in the future costs to this industry will move to the extent that they moved over the last period of years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the Labor party's reticence about debating this issue but it is one of vital national importance. We are nearing the completion of almost 14 years of Labor government in this country and we have three areas that are causing particular concern to what we might refer to as mainstream Australia&mdash;which really incorporates most Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those issues is the fact that unemployment is again rising and youth unemployment remains at such appalling high levels. The second issue concerns the decline in housing affordability, and linked to that is the highly unusual situation for Australia where home owners and home buyers are finding that their equity in their homes is falling. In a number of instances the home owner's debt is greater than his equity. The third issue concerns an appalling legacy from a Labor government of a greater gap between rich and poor than existed when it came to office. Those are three areas of debate which are vitally important to all Australians and issues which should be discussed in the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start with the unemployment picture. This issue is obviously topical in view of the release of the unemployment statistics last week. Those figures showed that unemployment has risen slightly, but nevertheless has risen to 8.55 per cent. Over 760,000 Australians are now unemployed. It is particularly worrying because under this Labor government's policies during the recession, unemployment rose to a record high level since the war. As the Senate will recall, we reached over one million unemployed. During the recovery from the recession the figure of unemployed has very slowly reduced but now, some years on, we find that the trend has started to move up again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is probably no statistic that could be a greater indictment and a greater worry to most Australians than that of 760,000 Australians out of work. For the young Australians who want work, but who are unable to get it, we have a national figure of some 27 per cent. This is the situation in a country that is so potentially rich. It is an appalling record for any administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening should be obvious even to this Labor government. The government made it plain that to continue to reduce unemployment we needed economic growth in this country of 4.5 per cent or higher. Now, of course, that economic growth has slipped away, even in the government's own estimates, to between three and four per cent and trending down. The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, did not seem to be able to understand it at question time today, but on those figures it becomes impossible to further eat into this mass unemployment which will be the legacy of the Keating Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic growth that is now taking place under this government's economic foundation is simply insufficient to further reduce that level of mass unemployment. Mr Keating himself recognised it when he accepted that 4.5 per cent was a necessary minimum. As you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, Mr Keating said, `If you can't achieve growth of four per cent then you ought to give the game away.' It was prophetic because economic growth has now slipped under that level and is projected to go even lower. There can be no other logical consequence than that the government will cease to eat into this mass unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other statistics are available that reinforce our concerns. If we look at the figures for overtime we find that they reached a peak of 18 per cent in December last year and declined to 16 per cent in September 1995 and are still falling. If the government looks to its own indications, such as the trend as demonstrated in its DEET figures, it will find that it has clearly stabilised and is now starting to slowly reduce. The tragedy of unemployment still shows an average of 27.8 per cent. During question time today Senator Cook tried to talk his way through that subject. For young people who are seeking work the figure is 27.8 per cent&mdash;25.2 per cent for males and 32 per cent for females. There is no way that Senator Cook can avoid that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the graphs of history we find that six years ago the comparable figure was 15 per cent. It is now 27 per cent. Senator Ian Macdonald is particularly concerned about regional areas where the situation is worse. The Labor government has failed to address this issue. Areas in the cities are still in tragic circumstances. In Victoria, the Liberal government has been trying to rebuild the state economy after the disaster of Labor governments. Some areas still have over 50 per cent youth unemployment. The same situation applies in western New South Wales. In my state of South Australia much the same picture exists. The disastrous Bannon government practically bankrupted the state. As a result, in the northern suburbs of Adelaide we have 34 per cent youth unemployment, 30 per cent in the western suburbs, 43 per cent in the eastern suburbs, and in the southern suburbs&mdash;in such seats as Kingston, the seat of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney)&mdash;youth unemployment is at 45 per cent. Thus the picture continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, these Liberal governments have had to pick up the legacy of failed Labor inheritance. The same situation exists nationally. Despite the improving economic circumstances overall, the task of eating into those shameful unemployment figures for youth remains very difficult. That is the picture on unemployment. Not only is it tragic, but it is now on the rise again and there is no greater or more dramatic reason why this government should stand condemned. It does not deserve to be re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I mentioned was this very worrying one of housing affordability. We raise this matter today following the release of the Real Estate Institute of Australia figures. This body does not have any vested interest in talking down the affordability of housing. In its publication the institute keeps saying that it hopes the trend will discontinue. The trend for housing affordability under this government has been a deteriorating trend. The latest figures indicate that loan affordability has declined for the sixth consecutive quarter. Affordability is at its lowest level since 1992. This occurs at a time when the great Australian dream is still so important to most Australians. The fact that people's capacity to afford to buy a home is declining is of great concern to them. It is not surprising that Australians are upset with this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister likes to make comparisons. If we compare the situation in the 1980s with that of the early 1990s we find that housing affordability now stands at 33 index points whereas at the beginning of the 1980s it stood at 57 index points. Housing affordability has steadily declined under this government to the extent that it is half of what it was. The decline from 57 index points to 33 index points is a decline in affordability over the last 15 years of 43.3 per cent. What causes that? Regrettably, it is high and rising interest rates&mdash;a legacy of this government. Real interest rates are still around the highest in the western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inflation is rising again. We have the same consequences. The government no longer seems to be able to control underlying inflation. Why? Because of wage pressures. That is not surprising because the government's Accord has artificially suppressed wages in this country and average weekly wages have fallen. It is not surprising that housing affordability has suffered as a result. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter of public importance, raised by the opposition, about the economy, and one can say that we welcome the debate. It is raised by the opposition really out of fear for their own position&mdash;fear that, despite their attempt to label themselves as the battlers' party, the public of Australia still see them as a party for privilege, a party for special interests and, most importantly, a party without any policies and only platitudes to fill the gap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons the opposition has raised this matter of public importance out of fear is that, in today's news services, on the wires, there is a report on what the consumers of Australia think about the future of the Australian economy. What the ordinary people of Australia believe to be their future is an important consideration. This matter of public importance tries to produce a picture of gloom and doom. The figures for October, from the Roy Morgan Research Centre polling on consumer confidence, are reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consumer confidence in October rose to its highest point for 1995 with a significant boost in expectations of future economic conditions, the Roy Morgan Research Centre said today.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Morgan Consumer Confidence Rating, to be published in the Bulletin this week, rose 4.5 points in October to 116.2.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not an indication that the public of Australia believe the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, Mr Acting Deputy President, the fiction of this MPI is the big lie tactic that the opposition is deploying. Their big lie tactic is to paint gloom and doom in the expectation that they can mould perceptions within Australia. But, no matter how hard they attempt to mould perceptions about a failing economy, they will not be able to change the facts in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This MPI, which talks of failed economic and social justice policies, defies the facts. The facts do not present that sort of picture and, no matter how hard Senator Hill tries to contort the statistics, he will not be able to avoid what stands before the eyes of the public as plain as a pikestaff&mdash;the record of economic achievement of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, one is encouraged to ask the question: against what social policy base does the opposition operate, and against what social principles of compassion and concern for those Australians in less fortunate positions than those in employment does the opposition act? On the weekend, at the ACOSS meeting, we heard from John Howard a list of things the opposition will not do. We never heard anything from him about what the opposition will do. There is a major question mark hanging over what they will not do&mdash;a question mark which says, `How can you afford to reconcile what you say you will do in terms of outlays and promises that you have made to other interest groups and balance a budget, as you promise you will do, and afford the welfare costs that there are in Australia because of your concern for the underprivileged and for those less fortunate and less able to defend themselves'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just work through a couple of the statistics, and let the statistics speak for themselves. On youth unemployment, the number of teenagers looking for full-time work is at its lowest level since April 1990. In September, it fell by 2,900 to 88,500. In March 1983, when Labor came to power, there were more than 158,000 young people looking for full-time work&mdash;nearly 80 per cent more than there are today. That hardly speaks to the point of this MPI about youth unemployment, or concern for unemployment. The record of the opposition in government is one of massive unemployment, double digit unemployment, and our record in government is one of bringing unemployment down from those peaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, with respect to youth unemployment, the figures need to be thought about and considered quite properly in detail before anyone jumps to conclusions, because the figure most commentators have been using is 27 per cent. In fact, the official unemployment rate for 15- to 19-year-olds, as measured by the ABS, is 20.7 per cent, which is the original data. But even this, in many respects, is misleading for this group, as has been recognised by a number of pundits, including the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 13 October this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an ABS study found, most of the teenagers counted as unemployed are, in fact, students looking for part-time work. While there were 88,500, 15- to 19-year-olds looking for full-time work&mdash;and these figures are seasonally adjusted&mdash;this is only around seven per cent of the total population aged 15 to 19. So when we have these figures bandied about, as Senator Hill did, of 27 per cent, they should be seen against that fact: that the ABS, in fact, is counting many students who are looking for part-time work in that figure. The real figure is around only seven per cent of the total population aged between 15 and 19. I think that exposes one of the big lies that the opposition is trying to foster in this campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key factor is: which party&mdash;us or the opposition&mdash;is best suited to manage the economy? When John Howard was the Treasurer in Australia, the average rate of real economic growth was 2.6 per cent. Under Labor, for the nearly 13 years of our government, it has averaged for all of that time 3.5 per cent. If employment is the test, then let us look at the average number of jobs created per year. Under John Howard, when he was Treasurer, 51,300 for the whole of the Fraser period was the average number of jobs created; whereas under us, the average number of jobs created each year is 163,600. Compare those figures again: 51,300 or 163,600. That is the difference between these two parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the annual average growth in employment, when John Howard was Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, employment on average grew annually at 0.8 per cent. It has been growing at 2.3 per cent under us. If you look at the unemployment rate when John Howard left office, it was at 10 per cent. It is 8.5 per cent now. The number of extra jobs created over the last 12 months in Australia is 333,200, and that is a considerable change on anything that the opposition has been able to produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the biggest part of this big lie, however, is when the opposition talks about social security and social security pensions. As if this party has any justification for holding its head up in public on social security! It ought to be ashamed of itself; it ought to be disgusted with itself. Australians see through it, since it has fought Medicare all the way along the line and opposed its very existence. It has fought changes in pension rates in Australia all along the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just give you a few examples here, in percentage terms, of real change. Under the coalition government&mdash;and this is the period December 1975 to March 1983; the period of the Fraser government when Mr Howard was Treasurer&mdash;the value of the pension for a single age pensioner not renting went down by 2.3 per cent. If they were renting privately, it went down by 2.2 per cent. Under us, `not renting' went up by 11.9 per cent, and `renting privately' went up by 20.4 per cent. For a pensioner couple, they went down 2.1 per cent in both categories under the coalition. They went up 12 per cent and 16.5 per cent under us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not have any of this cant about welfare, because the social welfare changes are quite dramatic. The real value of the Commonwealth social wage per person under John Howard in the period 1977-78 to 1982-83 declined by 17.5 per cent. The total value of the services delivered to the underprivileged in this country and to wage and salary earners reliant on a high standard of health care, a high standard of education and a high standard of other service delivery actually declined during the Fraser years, when John Howard was Treasurer, by 17.5 per cent. During our period of office, 1982-83 to 1995-96, it has gone up by 73.1 per cent. That should be sufficient to put an end to the issue of the underprivileged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the subject of real wages, because again today Senator Hill misled the Senate when he insisted that real wages under a Labor government have fallen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a clear fact that what Senator Hill said was not true. He said that real wages had fallen under Labor. The truth is that during the period of our stewardship of this country real wages, full-time adult average weekly earnings, have increased by 7.2 per cent. While those opposite continue to run around saying they have fallen, they are propounding a fiction in the public, which goes to this big lie scare mentality of undermining the success of the Australian economy that we have come to know from the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to another statistic about real household disposable income, because wages are one measure of how well people are doing. The level of tax they pay, what they take out of those wages, is another. The provision of a social wage, the provision of services delivered by a government to ordinary citizens, also goes to what their real quality of life and real standard of living are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Household disposable income is a measure which shows at a household level how much people have in their pockets after they have met their tax bill. Real household disposable income under this government has increased by 41.8 per cent, and real household disposable income divided by per person in the household has gone up by 20.9 per cent. The approximate increase in real annual household disposable income per capita from June 1983 to June 1995, expressed in the current June 1995 dollars, is $3,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go on to one other statistic, which is interest rates. The opposition, which has come in here and accused the government of having high interest rates, ought to look at its own record. Interest rates in Australia reflect what the expectations will be of inflation. The level of inflation in this country has come down dramatically. The inflation stick has been broken by us; therefore, interest rates have fallen under us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember this: when John Howard was the Treasurer of this country, we were in recession, and in recession you expect interest rates to fall. Interest rates in the recession under John Howard were higher. Housing loans were at 12.5 per cent; building society rates, when Howard left office, were at 13.9 per cent. That is their record on interest rates. At the present time interest rates are at 10.5 per cent for the categories of home loans, and now you can shop around in a much freed-up market and get better deals than that. So let us not have this cant that interest rates are high. By the standards of the coalition, interest rates in this country are much lower, and people do respect that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I just conclude by talking for a few minutes about industrial relations, because there is very little we know about the opposition's economic policies. Under their headland speeches, all they said was that they would create a productivity commission&mdash;made up of the Bureau of Industry Economics, EPAC and the Industry Commission&mdash;and that that productivity commission would recommend economic policy. All we know is that they are going to shift the deckchairs around, create a new body and rely on the public servants that inhabit that new body to tell the country what their economic policies should be. Is this responsible government? Hardly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that headland speech as well, we do know something. The thing that we know is that Mr Howard is determined to press ahead with his industrial relations changes&mdash;his industrial relations changes that were rejected overwhelmingly in the last election. But they are foxing clever this time. They know that the battlers&mdash;the blue-collar vote that they so carefully try to cultivate&mdash;reject absolutely and fundamentally the industrial relations changes put forward by the coalition last time. So what have they done? They have changed the words. The first thing that they have done is said that Labor will run a scare campaign on this. We have no intention of running a scare campaign; we are going to run a truth campaign and expose the vacuous nature of your changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare this. In 1981, when the coalition was in government, the average number of working days lost per 1,000 employees because of your industrial relations policies was 797. In 1994 the figure was 76 working days lost per 1,000 employees. Which government is capable of inducing industrial harmony? It is us, not you lot. The only thing that is fracturing that record is the behaviour of state Liberal governments. Take the example of Western Australia. Tomorrow there will be a state strike in Western Australia directly in protest about the industrial relations so-called reforms that are being enacted in that state. There is one thing that people in the workplace want to hear about this opposition, and that is why they want to pick out the no-disadvantage test in industrial relations law. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill's motion today highlights three areas of significant failure in the government's economic and social policies. So far we have had the usual `our record is better' or `worse than yours' debate, as seen in here regularly. In terms of the motion on youth unemployment, while the absolute rate is falling it is not falling as quickly as adult unemployment. Young Australians are now 3 1/2 times more likely to be unemployed than adult Australians. Yet two years ago they were `only' 2.9 times as likely to be unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's key employment programs, including a jobs compact between the unemployed, government and business, have largely failed to meet their targets. Jobstart, for example, a subsidy program, has not been taken up by business. In the first year of its operation it has failed to reach its target by 40 per cent. That is 92,000 places. I would say in making that criticism, though, that businesses like Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation so far have shown very little interest in availing themselves of these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response from government has been to trundle more and more of the unemployed into short-term, mostly unaccredited training schemes. We are close to having the best trained dole queue in the world. Too few of the training opportunities are going to go anywhere. For example, accredited training places per youth are 60 per cent behind target. Places in the Australian traineeship system are also 20 per cent behind target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue Senator Hill's motion deals with is housing affordability. Again, that is the function of three key things: interest rates, house prices and the ability to save. I have said many times here that our interest rates are amongst the highest in the world. They are kept high, in our view, because of two key policy failures of government&mdash;firstly, our excessively high current account spurred on by a debt-ridden public sector and a trade and industry policy which keeps exporting Australian jobs overseas and, secondly, our uncompetitive banking sector, which the government allows to charge margins on bank loans, particularly to housing and small business customers, margins on average twice as large as banks in other industrialised countries. Yet despite warnings from the Reserve Bank last year that margins on bank loans were too high, nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the third matter of the motion, the gap between the rich and the poor, every study on income distribution shows that the gap between rich and poor in this country has widened between 1980 and 1995. The OECD now says we have the third worst income distribution of any member country. At the heart of this are the combined policies of the government and the opposition over the last decade, pushing each other to lower government taxes on high income earners to provide tax breaks and government subsidies and support to entrepreneurs while at the same time increasing user-pays charges and decreasing services and support to low and middle income earners. Labor can at least point to a reasonably good record of a well targeted safety net, of social security payment increases, of Medicare and of&mdash;rapidly diminishing&mdash;free education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the dumping of Fightback, the coalition spent much of the last decade trying to water these things down. Similarly, Labor has spent much of the last three years also chipping away at things like free education and at the rules on targeting. It was interesting to see Mr Howard give commitments to ACOSS last week that the opposition will not wind back the safety net. That is a welcome commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if we really want to talk about the disadvantage faced by mainstream Australian families because of economic and social policy failure, we should all cast our minds a few months back to the Competition Reform Policy Bill, passed in here on the combined vote of the government and opposition. This bill converts public services in the public interest into economic goods to be contracted out, to be sold, to be bartered, whatever. Competition might very well be a good thing when you are selling apples and oranges but it is not necessarily a good thing when it comes to delivering health services or aged care services or providing decent housing for low income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that in some of these areas we still accept a social responsibility to educate or clothe or house people. That social responsibility overrides the dictates of the market, which has been the feature of the government's and opposition's economic and social policy of the last decade. What you end up with often is access to services limited to the well-off or the very poor. The group which misses out are working families&mdash;precisely these battlers whom everyone is professing to be so concerned about. In ten years get ready to point the finger back to what we did in here a few months ago, to another economic and social policy failure which will disadvantage mainstream Australian families. How do we know this? Because it has happened already in Great Britain in terms of higher prices for basic services, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get away from, `your record is worse than ours.' The federal government does stand condemned for some of its performance on youth unemployment. Most Australians, like myself, are waiting for the opposition's answer to these problems. But what we need to do is not have more of the same but rethink the last decade of economic and social policy failure in this country. They have been totally market based and that has been an inadequate solution. So I hope that I am wrong in saying in 10 years' time people will point back to the last few months and look to where mainstream Australian families have been again disadvantaged. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Eight short years after that ill-fated quote and some 13 years under the Labor government it seems that Australia is no closer to solving the problem of inequality and poverty. In fact, some studies show that during the past decade poverty and inequality have risen dramatically. Poverty, Adam Smith wrote, is `not having enough to live without shame in your own community.' In communities around this country it seems that more and more Australians are forced to live in shame.</PARA></TALK.START>

Yet this perception of middle class society is now nothing more than a myth, a vestige of the 1950s and 1960s ethos when the middle class was a growing sector in our society. In the 1990s we are a much more polarised society. Australia's middle class is shrinking, while both ends of the economic spectrum are growing.

With the number of retired people growing by over 10 per cent each year, the level of income inequality in Australia is directly linked to the growing number of pensioners, with more and more people leaving the work force and retiring on the old age pension.

These are the young Australians in full-time, low-skilled jobs; taking home low-paying wages, with some wages just above the poverty line. These are the people who are trying to build a home, raise a family and keep some hope&mdash;but this hope is fading fast. I defy senators to show me a couple on a single income who can afford to buy a house. It is fatuous to suggest they can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These hard-working young Australians now constitute almost 10 per cent of the bottom income earners in this country. These are the forgotten poor, the working poor, the single-income families who are battling to stay off the social security system and to maintain the self-esteem that having a job provides. Just because they have a job does not restrict them from being in the poverty trap. For the low wage earner, the benefits provided by the state for the elderly and the unemployed are scarce. Studies show that the working poor are the most affected by the inequalities in wealth distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are effectively to reduce poverty in this country we must not limit ourselves to those without work. Our efforts must include bolstering the vulnerable at the lower end of the income scale. There are 8,520,284 citizens receiving benefits from government&mdash;that is, from taxpayers&mdash;in this country. It seems ironic that at a time when we are striving for greater autonomy and independence as a nation, we are quickly chaining ourselves to foreign lenders, as their servants. </PARA>

I would have been even more interested if they had contained the policies that are going to be pursued by the coalition if they ever get into government. It is really quite curious that this MPI criticises the family policies of this government and of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This government is more committed to the needs of families than probably any other government in Australia's history.

I would like to briefly outline the initiatives this government has taken to enhance the position of families and to further contrast the position of families prior to the election of this Labor government in 1983. The truth is that the opposition, when last in government, had an opportunity to do something for families in Australia&mdash;but chose not to. If they are in government, again they will choose to do nothing for families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major achievement of this government in terms of families is Medicare, a universal health cover that ensures that each family has their health needs met in times of crisis and when they are ill. This is where the security of families starts. This government has concentrated on the preservation of health and the prevention of disease by increasing expenditure on immunisation, breast cancer detection and cervical cancer detection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of family income support, the additional family payment has been added to what was known as child endowment. That had dwindled away to virtually nothing before this government was in office. The payment was increased and paid directly to the carers in families, usually women, to assist in the care of their children. It is aimed at the less well off in our community who may not otherwise be able to properly provide for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1983 to 1995 family assistance has increased in real terms by 149 per cent, a real achievement for families. In terms of the home child-care allowance, this was a payment introduced by this government. It was a direct payment to carers at home, again usually mothers, to allow them to properly care for their children. That initiative had not been considered previously. Just this year the maternity allowance came in, a payment of six weeks maternity allowance on a means tested basis for those who earn under $61,000. It is a payment of $816 at the most difficult time for many families, a time when families are under stress, emotionally and financially. The government saw fit to take the initiative of providing those families with that additional assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the government has assisted working families in the area of child care. This government has the objective of achieving 300,000 places by 1996-97. To date, over 240,000 have been created. This is a real commitment to families. We have also made child care affordable by the subsidy provided by the child-care allowance and by the direct child-care rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Centre for Social and Economic Growth found that these payments boosted the take home pay of mothers at work by up to 60 per cent, certainly something that is going to help families. Altogether, these payments made by the Commonwealth together with the housing and education programs put forward by this government amount to $1,670 of social wage per person. In fact, over the period of this government&mdash;from 1983 to 1995&mdash;as Senator Cook said, the social wage has increased by a staggering 73.1 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the Senate this evening really encapsulates what is good government and all that is under the jurisdiction of governments to administer in our society, including youth unemployment, unemployment generally, housing affordability and the gap between the rich and the poor. So it is a worthy motion to discuss today. The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, (Senator Cook), the leader of the government speakers this afternoon, trotted out his usual `them and us' speech. He twisted and turned all the figures into favourable comparisons of his government with the Fraser government 13 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not accept those figures, Senator Cook should realise that that has really now become very hollow rhetoric. Australians have stopped listening. No matter how Senator Cook invites us to look at it, the matter is far simpler than the figures trotted out by him. It could not have been put better than by international media baron Rupert Murdoch last week, when he expressed the very feelings that mainstream Australians have. They are not very complicated; they are really quite simple. Rupert Murdoch referred to this country's youth unemployment as disgraceful. That is the feeling in society, and the Morgan Gallup poll and all trending polls reflect it. It is a very simple feeling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both sides can spend hours in this chamber rattling out figures for averages, absolutes, reals and nominals, but out in mainstream Australia, as this motion highlights, the feeling is that economic circumstances have not improved and that the economy is a disgrace, as expressed by Rupert Murdoch. You only have to look at the editorials, articles and letters to the editor that followed Rupert Murdoch's comments to see how much people agree with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disgraceful that this country has 27 per cent youth unemployment, particularly when only two weeks ago this nation was crowned the richest nation in the world by the OECD. It is true; we are the richest nation in the world. We have vast mineral resources, expansive agricultural lands, a very moderate climate to do our work in and a very stable political system compared with other nations. Given that backdrop, it is even more disgraceful when you consider that, when all those natural talents are put together, we have great social uncertainty and anxiety in the community after 13 years of this government. We have a growing gap between the rich and the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have always prided themselves on never having had the extremes between poverty and wealth that are so prevalent in America or the Asian nations. While we do not yet have extremes like those in America and Asia, we are certainly dangerously propelling ourselves in that direction. For the first time, we are actually talking about an underclass in this country and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now reached a stage where we have a second generation of unemployed persons. There are families where the parents and children are without jobs. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics report has found that more than 700,000 children under the age of 15 are in families where no-one has a job. Naturally, they are caught in the poverty trap. Demand on charity food banks increased last Christmas&mdash;1994; we are approaching the 1995 Christmas&mdash;to historical levels. Saint Vincent de Paul declared that, in its 140 year history, it had never had such a demand upon its services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a measure of that growing trend, in 1991, the Smith Family provided aid for 25,000 Victorians. In 1992, it increased to 42,000. In 1993, it jumped to 79,000. In 1994, it jumped to 110,000. This Christmas, it is expected to jump again. Why should it not, because that is the trend. All those charities are now at near breaking point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the very stacked nature of our Reserve Bank, it takes a lot for a Reserve Bank governor or board member to start talking about urban ghettos. You would be surprised if you were told that a Reserve Bank board member started talking about the growing gap between the rich and the poor in this country and the possibility of urban ghettos in Australia. That is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prominent and distinguished professor, Bob Gregory, a member of the Reserve Bank board but also a distinguished labour market economist, released some alarming research in around April on the growing gap between the rich and the poor. That study found that, in 1976, the average income of people in the bottom five per cent of neighbourhoods was 60 per cent of that of the top five per cent of neighbourhoods. More than 15 years later, those at the bottom earn less than 40 per cent of those on the top income. It has dropped 20 per cent. That is a backward motion. </PARA>

Whilst we on the government side have been talking about what our policies have been able to deliver, the opposition has talked about zero policies, or how it would do things better. We do not like high unemployment. We have a number of programs in place to address it. We have done a lot to address high inflation and high interest rates. When we came into power in 1983, we had the triple whammy of double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and double digit interest rates. Those opposite forget about that. We worked to bring these three things down to a much more acceptable level. We are still working on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of public importance talks about the alleged growing gap between the rich and the poor. It fails to recognise that the lowest income groups in Australia have gained very substantially in recent years. Real average household incomes have increased by 20 per cent since 1983. That is not ignoring the growing gap.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The disillusion and disadvantage faced by mainstream Australians is a result of failed economic and social policies.

It has been axiomatic that there is really very little difference between ALP new right policies and coalition new right policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is a difference, for example on the subject of labour market reforms, it seems that the coalition policies would probably make things worse for mainstream Australians who provide the labour you want to make cheaper. The coalition cannot make things very much more worse; it just makes them more obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic ideology of both major parties is that taxes should be low. Both parties believe the crucial economic factor is to assure and maintain high profitability for big companies. As a social agenda, this is outrageous. Increasing the amount of profit that goes to the rich cannot remedy any problem mentioned in this matter of public importance. It would be one thing if profit was based on technical efficiency, but it is not. The focus is on capital efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the push has been to greater labour productivity. This generally means that the mainstream Australian is asked to do more work for less money. It may mean that they are expected to do unpaid overtime or to work harder. It may mean that companies sack workers, leaving those remaining to do more while leaving some things, generally customer service, poorly done. It is often trying to break down extra payment for unsociable hours, which means more people will be working such hours. It means an end to any sense of job security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the days when the ALP presented a real alternative to the coalition, the issue of distribution of profits was central. The principle is that major industry is a social activity, and the profits should be distributed equitably. Failure to do this, allowing for the economic and social power of capital to direct the profits its way, accruing to the rich, is unjust and ultimately counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time to reassert that principle, and if we are concerned with distribution of profit, if we are concerned with unemployment and underemployment, and if we are concerned about distributing the benefits of technical advance, we must give mainstream Australians a greater share of the profits their efforts generate. This means higher wages for ordinary people and less exorbitant salaries for executives. Part of this effort at equity should be a decrease in hours in the standard working week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another side of the agenda has been the erosion of the quality and number of public services. The big push to privatisation seems like it will give little benefit to mainstream Australians, will probably mean that some people will pay more and will probably mean it will be harder to get a decent level of service. The main virtue of privatisation seems to be that a lot of people can be sacked, and companies no longer need to be socially responsible in a number of directions. Water authorities will not need to consider conservation. Other areas, such as the privatisation of libraries, will probably mean that services become either more expensive or less available. We have already seen that in the health system. Yes, the disillusionment and disadvantage are issues. Unfortunately, the coalition presents no better alternative. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (FBT COST OF COMPLIANCE) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995 will amend the fringe benefits tax and income tax laws to give effect to the Government's fringe benefits tax cost of compliance statement of 24 February 1995. It will also make changes to the fringe benefits tax substantiation rules which were announced on 29 March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with this Government's desire to minimise taxpayers' costs in complying with the tax laws, the amendments in this bill will substantially reduce compliance costs for employers liable to fringe benefits tax. In addition, a number of benefits provided by employers will no longer be subject to fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the measures in this bill will apply from 1 April 1995, the start of the current fringe benefits tax year. However, measures dealing with living away from home allowances will take effect from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exempt items</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will exempt from fringe benefits tax a range of benefits that are primarily used for business purposes. These benefits include employment related protective clothing, briefcases, calculators and electronic diaries, tools of trade, employment related software and portable computers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mobile and car phones will also be exempt where their use is primarily for employment purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of the safety and health issues involved, taxis provided by employers to employees for travel to and from home between the hours of 8pm and 6am will be exempt, as will taxi travel for sick employees to home or to another place of care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption of taxi travel is estimated to cost $45 million in 1995-96 and $30 million in each later year. The other exemptions have a small but unquantifiable cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Declarations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also reduce the number of declarations required by the fringe benefits tax law. Where a series of identical benefits is provided, an employee declaration is generally required each time a benefit is provided so that the private portion of the benefit can be determined. This requirement for multiple declarations will be replaced by a single employee declaration which can be used for up to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, a single employer declaration will also be available in certain situations. This declaration can also be used for up to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Entertainment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will reduce the compliance costs associated with the calculation of FBT on meal entertainment by providing two further options for determining the value of a benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simplest of these methods is to accept that 50 per cent of expenditure on meal entertainment in a year is subject to fringe benefits tax, with the balance being non-deductible to the employer. This method will also be available for use with the lease or hire costs of corporate boxes and other entertainment facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other method requires the employee to keep a twelve week register. This register is then applied over the whole year to determine the amount of meal entertainment which is subject to fringe benefits tax and the amount which is deductible for income tax purposes. The register will remain effective for up to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Car parking</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments in the bill will also reduce the compliance costs associated with the taxation of car parking benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, fringe benefits tax will no longer apply to car parking on employers' premises unless there is a commercial car parking station within a one kilometre radius that charges more than $5 a day at the beginning of the fringe benefits tax year. This will ensure that fringe benefits tax will only apply to car parking in areas where such benefits have significant values, such as in CBD areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, employers will be able to adopt a simplified method of valuing car parking benefits. This new method will enable an employer to determine the value of a benefit by reference to the average of the lowest commercial car park fees at the start and end of the FBT year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, a further two optional methods for calculating the total taxable value of car parking fringe benefits will be available. One of these methods uses a statutory formula and the other allows an employer to keep a twelve week record of car park usage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comparable changes will be made to the income tax law relating to the deductibility of car parking expenditure incurred by self-employed taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are estimated to cost $76 million in 1995-96 and $62 million in each later year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also take the opportunity in this bill to make a technical correction to ensure that, as originally intended, car parking benefits provided by Commonwealth, State or Territory government educational institutions will be exempt from fringe benefits tax. This amendment, which will have no effect on revenue, will be retrospective to 1 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Living-away-from-home allowances</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also modify the fringe benefits tax treatment of living-away-from-home allowance benefits and other food and accommodation benefits provided to employees who are required to live away from their usual place of residence. These modifications will provide a greater degree of certainty in determining whether the benefits will be subject to concessional treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These benefits will be subject to concessional treatment for up to four years for benefits provided to expatriates working in Australia or for benefits provided to Australian residents working overseas, for up to two years for employees working in remote areas (unlimited time for employees working on a `fly-in fly-out' basis) and for up to one year for benefits provided for all other employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The date of effect of these measures has been moved to 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Substantiation rules</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend the fringe benefits tax substantiation provisions to make them generally consistent with the revised income tax substantiation rules, including reducing the period for which records are required to be retained from seven to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Car statutory formula</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to maintain the revenue neutrality of this package of compliance cost reduction measures, the bill will increase the statutory fractions used in the statutory formula for car benefits by approximately 10 per cent. Even with these increases in the statutory fractions, the statutory formula will remain significantly concessional under a wide range of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment is estimated to raise $121 million in 1995-96 and $91 million in each later year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rebate for medical research bodies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also extend the rebate of fringe benefits tax presently allowed to certain non-profit, non-government bodies to certain medical research bodies which, while established under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law, are not conducted by or on behalf of a government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will be effective from 1 April 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also foreshadow that the Government will be moving some minor amendments to the bill in the Senate. Copies of those amendments and a Supplementary explanatory memorandum will be circulated to senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PUBLIC SERVICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes a number of amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 and the Public Service Act 1922 to implement the decision announced in the 1995-96 Budget to amalgamate the Public Service Commission and the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will generate only modest savings of approximately $200,000 in 1996-97 and subsequent years, the Government considers that significant benefits will result from the arrangements proposed in this bill. By drawing on the collective experience of both organisations and rationalising their corporate resources, the amalgamated body, which will be known as the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, will be better placed to develop innovative personnel management and service delivery arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will provide the Public Service, and the people of Australia generally, with tangible benefits. The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission will bring together two vital streams of people management in the public sector and create an environment in which systemic issues which are brought to light in the grievance and appeals handling process can more effectively inform and improve the policy perspectives of the Public Service Commissioner. Similarly, integration with the Public Service Commissioner will provide staff of the Agency with a better appreciation of the policy issues relevant to their casework activities. By drawing together the Public Service Commission's work on best practice and the MPRA's experience in merit protection and grievance resolution, the new Commission's ability to contribute to the delivery of quality service to the Australian public will be greater than the sum of its individual parts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government remains committed to the principles on which the MPRA was established and which are articulated in its legislation&mdash;fairness, equity, sound personnel management practices, efficiency and good staff relations. The MPRA has an important role in preserving key values in Australian Government employment and, in particular, in preserving the merit system. In its first eleven years, the MPRA has developed an enviable reputation for probity and independence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing this legislation, the Government has been careful to ensure that the Public Service Commissioner and the Director of the MPRA, who will in future be known as the Merit Protection Commissioner, will continue to exercise their statutory powers independently of each other. The powers of the MPRA in relation to the investigation of grievances and the resolution of disputes will be unaffected by these amendments, and it will be just as vigorous in protecting public servants' rights as it has always been. The Government's intention is that the two Commissioners should have a close and cooperative relationship, but that neither will be able to interfere in the other's statutory role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One necessary consequence of the amalgamation of the staff of the Public Service Commission and the MPRA, however, is that the Merit Protection Commissioner will no longer have the powers of a Secretary in relation to the staff of the MPRA. These powers will rest with the Public Service Commissioner, but the Government expects the Public Service Commissioner to delegate his personnel management powers in relation to the staff of the Commission who are required for the purposes of the Merit Protection Act to the Merit Protection Commissioner. This will guarantee the continued independence of the MPRA from the Public Service Commission, and ensure that there will be no diminution in the rights of public servants to independent appeal and grievance mechanisms as a result of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, the bill makes a number of other minor changes to the act. Members of the Merit Protection Agency will continue to be appointed by the Governor-General in Council on Ministerial advice. However, the bill will require wider consultation on these appointments than is currently the case. In addition, the bill provides that only the Merit Protection Commissioner will be able to be appointed on a full time basis. This, in fact, has been the situation since the MPRA was established in 1984, and the amendment does no more than reflect the reality of the current practice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the bill is to strengthen the curfew at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will recognise the importance of balancing the interests of noise affected communities against the operational requirements of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The night hours are the most noise sensitive period. Communities affected by aircraft noise during the day deserve to be free of this disturbance during the night. The government is therefore committed to minimising, to the greatest extent possible, the activities at the airport during the night-time curfew period. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has already made significant improvements to the curfew regime over the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last December, the government introduced a monetary penalty of up to $25,000 for curfew breaches. This replaced the previous arrangements where curfew breaches were dealt with administratively rather than by the courts and without provision for monetary penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last April the government introduced stricter limitations on movements by larger freight jets. Approvals for the operation of Boeing 737 and Airbus A300 freight aircraft have either lapsed or been withdrawn. Moreover, operations by McDonnell Douglas DC9 aircraft are being phased out and must be eliminated by May 1996. Permitted jet movements will then be restricted to the quieter British Aerospace BAe146 aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strict approach has also been adopted in considering requests for dispensations from the curfew at Sydney Airport. In the first six months of 1995, an average of 3 dispensations a month have been granted, compared with an average of approximately 25 curfew dispensations per month during 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations have been made to ensure that all night-time jet freight operations into Sydney Airport are banned after the opening of Sydney West Airport. The people of Western Sydney can be reassured that the government's comprehensive updating of the Environmental Impact Statement for the new airport will have as its central objective the prevention of noise nuisance arising from night-time operations. It is fundamentally important that we learn the lessons of Sydney Airport and ensure that future generations of Western suburbs residents are not exposed to excessive noise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The private members' bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition into the other House in the last sittings, by proposing only to replicate the current curfew regulations in an act, did nothing to ease the burden of the airport's operations at night on the residents of Sydney. After so strongly supporting the parallel runway development at Sydney Airport, the Opposition now seek to deceive voters into thinking they will do something about the curfew. In reality they would do nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of the Member for Lowe, the Howard private member's bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure with a view to strengthening the current curfew arrangements. Residents affected by aircraft noise in Sydney are fortunate to have an elected representative such as Mary Easson who recognised the need to strengthen the curfew and at whose instigation the Committee was tasked to look at this issue. The measures in this bill are the direct result of her efforts on behalf of residents living around Sydney Airport</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is grateful to Peter Morris and his committee for carrying out this Inquiry and reporting in such a tight time-frame. The proposals put forward by the committee comprise a significant package and have been of considerable assistance in the preparation of the bill now before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, in building on the current stricter curfew arrangements, goes much further to provide a range of new initiatives to strengthen and enhance the current controls. For this reason the government has decided to draft a new bill, rather than propose numerous amendments to the Opposition bill. The government's bill is aimed at minimising curfew aircraft operations at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the government, I would now like to respond to the committee's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their first two proposals the committee suggested steps to reduce the number of international passenger aircraft movements during the first and last hours of the curfew. The government accepts the absolute desirability of reducing the number of these movements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the committee's recommendations, the international entitlements in the bill reflect current usage patterns. This means an immediate reduction in the current international passenger jet entitlements between the hours of 5am and 6am from 42 movements per week, with no more than 8 on any day, to a maximum of 35 movements per week, with no more than 7 on any day. The bill also enables regulations to prescribe lower levels of entitlements. In line with the committee's proposal for a progressive phase-out, the Minister for Transport envisages reducing entitlements whenever practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally,  the bill introduces a regime requiring each individual international passenger movement during the curfew shoulder periods to be fully justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International passenger movements during the shoulder periods will not be permitted once Sydney West Airport is capable of handling those movements. In the interim, international passenger movements will only be approved if they can be justified by reason of curfew constraints at overseas airports or lack of available capacity at Sydney Airport outside the curfew.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes a process where operators of international passenger aircraft may apply to the Secretary of the Department of Transport for approval for specific flights. This will require the Department and the industry, for the first time, to assess carefully the feasibility of rescheduling these shoulder hour flights into non-curfew times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This process is consistent with the committee's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the public have complained about aircraft departing to the north of the Airport just on 11pm and therefore not clearing the suburbs until some time after the start of the curfew. In order to address this issue the bill contains a provision which requires all aircraft to depart over the Bay after 10.45pm. If wind conditions preclude these take-offs the aircraft will not be permitted to depart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current arrangements allow an aircraft that has received a clearance to push back from a gate before 11pm to depart during the curfew provided it takes-off over Botany Bay. Certain operators have taken advantage of this provision and have been seeking, and receiving, push back clearances well before they are actually ready to depart. This has allowed some aircraft to depart from the Airport well after 11pm without breaching the Regulations. In line with the committee's proposal this push back provision has been abolished. The bill before the Senate contains a provision based on taxi clearance, which means that aircraft will have to be actually available for take-off before 11pm .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I stated earlier curfew movements by the larger jet freight aircraft have been, or are being, phased out. In order to ensure that the gains from this initiative are not circumvented by the use of larger and relatively noisy propeller-driven aircraft, the bill contains a provision which prohibits the use of propeller-driven aircraft which have a maximum take-off weight greater than 34,000kg. This seeks to address the concerns expressed by the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been considerable public disquiet about the issuing of curfew dispensations and the committee made a number of proposals in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In future, guidelines will be used in assessing applications for curfew dispensations. The preparation of these guidelines will be subject to a public consultation process. It is envisaged that, subject to this process, the guidelines will restrict any such operations to fly only over Botany Bay. However, there will be provision for dispensations to be granted for operations on other runways in the event of a force majeure situation arising, for example, civil emergencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a dispensation is granted, the bill requires the minister to table a statement outlining the reasons for the dispensation in each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Morris committee suggested that the minister be given authority to increase the number of flights during the curfew for one-off events such as the 2000 Olympics. The government intends to ensure that Sydney Airport and Sydney West Airport, which will then be open, are capable of handling the level of air traffic during the Olympic period without the need to relax the curfew at Sydney Airport. This proposal is therefore not accepted by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present curfew regulations the maximum fine for a breach of the curfew was $25,000 for a corporation. This is consistent with the Commonwealth criminal law policy that penalties in regulations are intended for minor offences only. By placing the curfew controls in this act, the penalties can be increased to be consistent with those imposed for similar offences under other legislation. The government therefore supports the committee's proposal that the bill provide for penalties of up to $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is committed to improving the processes for community consultation on curfew issues. This is already demonstrated through the establishment of the Sydney Airport Community Consultative committee chaired by the Hon Joe Riordan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Morris committee has proposed that this be further pursued through a general purpose standing committee of the House of Representatives. The bill incorporates the consultation procedures currently before the Parliament in the Legislative Instruments bill. They will allow public scrutiny of any proposals to amend this bill once enacted. They will also apply to development of instruments under this legislation. Adoption of these consultation procedures will not of course preclude any curfew issues being dealt with by a Parliamentary committee when considered necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of residents being woken up early on weekend mornings by a succession of landings from the north starting at 6am has been a particular problem. The committee proposed that the feasibility of restricting operations over Botany Bay between the hours of 10pm and 11pm and 6am and 7am at weekends be examined. The bill adopts this proposal to give much needed relief in this area, whenever safe operations can be conducted over Botany Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On certain occasions aircraft approach the Airport from the south at night, but `miss the approach' and have to abort their landings. Although this is an internationally accepted procedure and is essential to safe flying, it results in the aircraft flying over the suburbs to the north and creating significant noise disturbance. In order to explain to the community the reason for these events the committee proposed that operators place an explanatory advertisement in local newspapers within 7 days of such an event.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal has not been taken up in full due to advice of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority which considers that a statutory requirement for airlines themselves to give a public account for carrying out a missed approach may have an adverse effect on flight safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, consistent with the longstanding requirement for the reporting of the use of reverse thrust, the bill contains a requirement for an explanatory report to be provided to the Secretary of the Department when a missed approach occurs. This information will be made public through the Sydney Airport Community Consultative committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee noted that noise disturbance at night is not restricted to aircraft operating out of Sydney Airport and that a study should be undertaken of the impacts of propeller-driven aircraft carrying out night-time operations around Sydney. The government accepts this. The proposed study will be carried out immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a first step to offset the noise impacts of propeller-driven aircraft operating into and out of Sydney Airport at night, the Minister for Transport proposes to amend the Air Navigation (Aerodrome Flight Corridors) Regulations so that propeller-driven aircraft will be required to adhere to flight corridors over the Kurnell sandhills when landing or taking off during the curfew.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One final matter raised by the committee was that the noise complaint handling procedures at Sydney Airport be reviewed. The Minister for Transport is now taking steps to ensure that this is done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With their ineffectual private member's bill having been gazumped by our curfew bill, the Opposition has pulled a new stunt in the form of an amendment to "re-open" the east-west runway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leaving aside the outrageous cynicism and cowardly deception displayed by the Opposition in attempting to back away from their strident advocacy for the third runway, nothing could be more detrimental to the interests of those in the flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All our technical advice has been in favour of parallel runway operations, just as it would be if the Opposition were in office. If they ignored such advice from all the relevant agencies and outside experts, they would be directly and singularly responsible for running the airport in a manner that was less safe and a long way below capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reality this notion of re-opening the east-west runway is the airlines proposal to use the eastern end of the runway for stub operations by propellers. Sure this would overcome some of the safety and capacity problems, but it would also free up the north-south axis for more jet operations. Indeed the movement rate to the north could be up to 80-85 jet aircraft per hour. An increase of at least 10 jets per hour to the north.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The airlines would be delighted because they could go on deferring any need to use Badgerys Creek and therefore to duplicate facilities. But the already suffering residents on the north-south flight path would face a huge increase in their noise burden, all thanks to the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps this is the reason they supported the third runway in 1989. Back then they were absolutely derisory about the issue of aircraft noise. Just as they try to deceive people into believing they now care about the low paid, they now say they care about noise affected residents. Well the government won't let them get away with it. At every turn we will remind the electorate of everything the Opposition has previously said. At the same time we will continue our own drive to provide genuine protection for noise affected residents under the Sydney Airport flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that the new measures introduced by the bill will significantly enhance the current curfew arrangements and will therefore bring much needed relief to residents living around Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">GOVERNOR-GENERAL AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enactment of this bill would set the salary of the next Governor-General after he is sworn in on 16 February 1996. Because Section 3 of the Constitution fixes the salary of the Governor-General for the term of office, the salary fixed at the commencement of the Governor-General's appointment must be set at a level that will still be appropriate at the end of the term. The Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the official salary of the Governor-General shall be exempt from income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor-General Act 1974 provided for a salary of $30,000. It was amended in 1977 to increase the salary to $37,000, in 1982 to increase the salary to $70,000 and in 1988 to increase the salary to $95,000. It is now proposed that the Governor-General's salary be $58,000. The salary will remain unchanged through the period of the next Governor-General's appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In proposing this salary for the next Governor-General, I would like Honourable Members to note that Sir William Deane has requested that the salary be set to take account of the non-contributory pension which he will receive under the Judges' Pension Act after retiring from the High Court. Payment of this pension will continue during his term of office as Governor-General. At the commencement of the term of office, the sum of Sir William's net pension and the proposed salary would be in the order of $130,000. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle that has governed the calculation of this amount is that used to determine the salaries of Governors-General in the past; that is, to keep the average salary over the notional period of the appointment somewhat ahead of the estimated average annual income, after tax, of the Chief Justice of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed salary, combined with Sir William's pension as a retired Justice of the High Court, is commensurate with the office, it is economically responsible, and maintains the traditional relativity between the Chief Justice and the Governor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ANL SALE BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANL Sale Bill makes the necessary legislative provision to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's shares in ANL Limited although agreement has been reached under which the finalisation of the sale to P&amp;O Australia has been deferred until 31 October 1995.  Finalisation of sale arrangements is subject to the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations on ANL's future industrial arrangements and the retention by the Commonwealth of a special share.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANL is a shipping company wholly owned by the Commonwealth. It formerly operated as the Australian National Line and was converted to a public company, with effect from 1 July 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government first announced its intention to sell a substantial part of ANL in the context of the 1991/92 Budget. A scoping study was undertaken which concluded, in 1992, that given its then trading circumstances, a sale of  less than 100 per cent of the company was unlikely to be commercially feasible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1994 a further consultancy was undertaken as the first stage of a due diligence process into ANL. The due diligence process is a thorough examination of the company which, among other things, is designed to give a firm understanding of its assets and liabilities. That report was completed in August 1994 and its recommendation was that due to ANL's poor financial position and bleak outlook a sale was unlikely to be possible at that time and that the Government's best option was likely to be a managed trade down of the company. This would have meant an effective liquidation of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than pursue this option, the Government decided to appoint a new Board, headed by Mr Neville Wran, to undertake further analysis, restructure the company and examine future options. The Government also announced its intention to provide guarantees in respect of ANL's debt and any future drawdowns under its Promissory Note facility so as to enable the restructuring to be carried out in a stable commercial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANL Board carried out some considerable restructuring of the Line, including the sale of ANL's interest in Australian Stevedores, the winding up of joint ventures with Howard Smith in bulk shipping and with Union Shipping in the trans-Tasman trade, the pay out of a bank debt facility and the lease on the ship River Torrens and some rationalisation of overseas and corporate staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having received and pursued a number of inquiries, the Board reported, earlier this year, that there was interest from a number of companies in the purchase of some or all of ANL, including proposals from two companies which may have involved the purchase of all of the Commonwealth's shares in ANL. In May 1995, the Government agreed to the Board progressing with potential bidders, expressions of interest in the purchase of the Commonwealth's shares in the Company. In the event one bid was received, being from P&amp;O Australia, and this was not for the purchase of ANL with all of its existing liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on that bid, the Board and Commonwealth officials have been able to negotiate an agreement under which P&amp;O would purchase the Commonwealth's shares in ANL, subject to a number of conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has had discussions with ANL unions, with the ACTU and with P&amp;O on the sale option. Deferral of a decision to finalise the sale to P&amp;O until 31 October 1995 will allow P&amp;O and the unions, under the leadership of the Secretary of the ACTU, to conduct negotiations on ANL's future industrial arrangements. Subject to the satisfactory completion of those negotiations, the sale to P&amp;O will be finalised. If the unions and P&amp;O cannot reach a resolution acceptable to them and to the Government then the option of restructuring ANL to increase the potential for it to return to viability will be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order for the option of a sale to P&amp;O to be quickly carried out at the completion of the negotiations between unions and P&amp;O, it will be necessary for the ANL Sale Bill to be passed by both Houses of Parliament by the end of October. P&amp;O is keen to be in a position to take action to turn ANL's results around. Any further delay creates uncertainty, with the risk of consequent damage to ANL's market share in its various businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The substantive provisions of the bill do not come into operation until the draft sale contract is signed. Should the contract not be signed by the end of 1995 the legislation provides for its automatic repeal on 1 January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes transitional and savings provisions in relation to ANL employee long service leave, maternity leave, compensation and rehabilitation and certain retirement benefits that have become standard in legislation providing for the disposal of major Commonwealth assets, as for example in the sales of Qantas, ASTA and CSL Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three major features of this bill which have arisen out of the negotiation of the draft sale contract and the recent discussions between the Government, unions and P&amp;O in relation to the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first feature relates to the provisions which flow from the fact that P&amp;O is not willing to purchase all of ANL's businesses nor take on all of ANL's liabilities. The second feature is the provision of an appropriation to meet any contributions required by the Commonwealth under the draft sale contract. The third feature is the need to provide for the protection of the future industrial arrangements that are being negotiated with P&amp;O.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To move the required businesses and liabilities out of ANL and convert ANL into a company with reduced liabilities, the bill provides for the transfer of certain of ANL's assets, rights, liabilities and obligations to a nominated company (or a subsidiary of that company) or to the Commonwealth direct. The nominated company, which is called "RetainCo" in the bill, must be wholly owned by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANL, under P&amp;O Australia's ownership, will continue to hold around $140 million of debt, in the form of ship and container leases and drawdowns under ANL's Promissory Note facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assets, liabilities, rights and obligations to be transferred out of ANL will primarily be long term ship leases and associated transaction documents, as well as several dormant ANL subsidiary companies. If a sale of ANL's shares in the Coastal ExpressLine business on satisfactory terms is not concluded prior to a sale to P&amp;O, a holding company structure will be utilised to protect the Commonwealth's interests in this business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the sale the Commonwealth will continue to hold liabilities in the form of obligations under the long term ship leases transferred from ANL to RetainCo. RetainCo's obligations under the ship leases are, however, to be substantially matched by reciprocal income streams under long term sub-leases of the ships to major companies (including ANL after the sale). These long term sub-leases are either in place or the subject of negotiations in train. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The liabilities of RetainCo, in total around $183 million, will progressively diminish over time as the leases are paid out and it is expected that RetainCo will be at least cash neutral to the Commonwealth over the long term; that is, there should be no net call on Commonwealth funds to meet RetainCo's obligations over its life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a Commonwealth guarantee to be granted in respect of the obligations transferred to RetainCo. As the company will not be a commercially operating company in the ordinary sense, a guarantee will be required to give comfort to financiers that it will be able to meet its obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is the possibility that RetainCo or an ANL company transferred to the Commonwealth may require operating funds in its initial year and the bill appropriates any funds necessary to provide working capital for 1995/96 for RetainCo or for the holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also appropriates up to $15 million to meet any Commonwealth contribution required under the draft sale contract. There are three elements to this contribution. The first element is to cover the contingency that relevant financiers may exercise change of ownership rights which would impose additional costs on the Commonwealth. Those financiers have, however, already provided in principle consent to the change of ownership. Other elements of the $15 million include any expenses, such as legal costs, related to the transfer of businesses out of ANL to RetainCo or the Commonwealth direct, and a contingency to provide for the possibility that ANL's operating results up to the date of sale are significantly worse than forecast.  Current expectations are that only a small percentage of the $15 million will be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the industrial arrangements to be negotiated in respect of ANL, the bill provides for the articles of association of ANL to contain special articles which will enshrine the outcome of those negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The special articles will not be able to be altered or removed without the consent of the Minister, and the Ministerial consent is to be an instrument required to be laid before Parliament and subject to disallowance. The consent will not be effective until the disallowance period has expired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the Minister to have the power to seek injunctions in the Federal Court to enforce the observance of the special articles and to prevent their removal or alteration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for alterations to ANL's tax position as a consequence of the sale. ANL's accounting period is to be aligned with P&amp;O's and the holding of the special share by the Commonwealth is to be deemed not to prevent ANL being treated as a wholly owned subsidiary of P&amp;O for tax purposes. ANL's accumulated tax losses, of about $70 million, for the period before the sale will be extinguished and will, therefore, not be available to P&amp;O to offset against profits post-sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that a sale is the preferred option and the bill will facilitate the realisation of a long term future for ANL. ANL is currently losing  around $2 million per month in its operations. ANL has some cash reserves, which were obtained from the sale of some of its assets, but once these have been  exhausted&mdash;a matter of months not years&mdash;it would require cash support from the taxpayer to continue to trade. This is not a sensible long term approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alternative to a sale is, therefore, a further major restructuring aimed at eliminating the likely need for taxpayer funding, which would see ANL withdraw from a number of trades and reduce in size. There is a risk that the resulting small organisation will lack sufficient resources to withstand any future poor trading periods. As is currently the case, ANL would not be able to influence in any significant way the freight rates paid by Australian importers and exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the sale is completed, ANL will continue to carry Australia's container imports and exports as a separate entity within the P&amp;O group. P&amp;O has indicated its intention to maintain ships under the Australian flag, crewed by Australian crews under Australian award conditions. Commonwealth ownership is not essential for there to be a continued Australian flag presence in international trades. In order to enhance the prospects of ANL's longer term commercial viability, and in the best interests of Australian taxpayers and the public at large, a sale to P&amp;O Australia is the Government's preferred course of action, subject to a satisfactory outcome to the current industrial negotiations. Passage of this legislation is required urgently to enable the sale to be completed as soon as this negotiation process has concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HUMAN SERVICES AND HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill is part of a package of two bills which will replace the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). That original bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 31 May, but divided by the Senate into two bills on 9 June. A message was sent from the Senate seeking the House's concurrence in its action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the original legislation was introduced a number of minor amendments have become necessary. Rather than pressing on with the original legislation the Government has decided to introduce these new bills to better integrate some related measures and incorporate other minor amendments to the portfolio's legislation. I shall mention these new matters as I outline for Senators' benefit the key provisions of the bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes amendments to the Child care Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953, and the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992. The bill repeals the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 which has become redundant due to a sunset provision which prevented further payments being made after 30 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes minor technical amendments to a number of acts as set out in Schedule 2 of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 will strengthen the original intention of the act and clarify and facilitate certain procedural aspects of the Childcare Cash Rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first group of amendments provide hardship provisions to assist certain groups of persons who are currently precluded from receiving the rebate but who should be entitled to the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These groups are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">children over the age of thirteen years who have a disability or other specified special need which requires ongoing child care;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">parents who should be considered to have work-related commitments, such as those who are eligible for, but not in receipt of, a Carer Pension; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">families in which one parent has a work-related commitment but the other parent is unable to work or look after their children due to extenuating circumstances such as a medical condition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment is sought to allow carers under the age of eighteen years who have specified formal child care qualifications to register under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments are proposed to confirm in legislation that family registration is able to be backdated to the date at which the family was first eligible to register, and that the rebate can be paid when a child is absent from child care for specified reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also some administrative amendments proposed to rectify a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen. These amendments also make consequential amendments to the act to bring it in line with changes to other Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other administrative amendments are proposed to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allow the Health Insurance Commission to backdate carer registrations to the date at which they were first eligible to register;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">cancel family or carer registrations and recover payments when an administrative error has been made;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">suspend family or carer registrations if cancellation of the registration is being considered;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensure that the rebate is not paid for child care expenses which have been made or will be reimbursed by another agent such as an employer;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clarify the eligibility or persons who are not Australian citizens by correcting the description of visa categories to bring the act into line with changes in the Migration Act;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">broaden the nature of courses which overseas students can be undertaking in order to be eligible for the rebate;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allow the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission to delegate powers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allow the Minister to have some discretion over receipting requirements; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to remove technical defects in the original act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has been changed to include two new minor technical amendments to allow the Health Insurance Commission to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">vary a family's registration if it believes a member of the family who is not included in the registration, should be included; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">cancel a family's registration where incorrect information is provided in connection with an application to vary the registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are designed to correct a number of minor drafting errors in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 which established the Professional Services Review Scheme. In addition, the amendments will allow the appointment, as a President of a Professional Services Review Tribunal, of a person who holds or has held judicial office in a State or Territory jurisdiction. One of the new measures in this bill is to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. The proposed amendment would expressly give the Health Insurance Commission the function of providing information technology services to the Commonwealth and to other bodies established by laws of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that the expertise which the Health Insurance Commission has now or will acquire in the future can be made available to perform services for Commonwealth Departments or other bodies established by this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The possibility of utilising the Commission's spare capacity and expertise is consistent with the recommended approach of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth agencies rationalising their existing information technology functions. This was foreshadowed in"Clients First", the Report of the Minister for Finance's Information Technology Review Group which was published in March this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 are designed to correct a deficiency in the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That act, which gave the Health Insurance Commission the power to investigate fraud under Medicare and to deal directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions, does not allow the Health Insurance Commission to retain evidential material seized under the authority of a search warrant for more than 60 days unless proceedings for an offence to which that material may afford evidence is instituted within that period. This deficiency will be corrected on the basis of advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions that without the amendment the Commission's search warrant powers are ineffectual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also empowers the Health Insurance Commission to engage in hedging of investment transactions, provide consulting, management and related services and exercise its powers and perform its functions overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission has undertaken a number of consultancies primarily, but not exclusively,under the auspices of the World Bank. As these activities are expanding, and moving beyond the use of spare capacity in the Commission's operations, it is desirable to make explicit provision to cover this activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far as the proposed hedging power is concerned, this is consistent with other Commonwealth legislation and has been addressed, on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, to resolve any doubt about the Commission's ability to enter into hedging transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hedging is, of course, one of the tools necessary in a prudent and balanced investment program which includes some overseas investments. The Commission operates Medibank Private in competition with other private insurers and must have available to it the same opportunities to manage the funds vested in it by its members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also contains amendments to parts of the National Health Act 1953 which regulate the administration of nursing homes. The Government has decided that these amendments should not await the introduction of the new Aged Care Act. The amendments to the current legislation are essential to address two immediate issues that have been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly there are a number of technical amendments to the National Health Act 1953 (the Principal Act) consequential upon amendments to the Principal Act introduced by the National Health Amendment Act 1992 which resulted in the entitlement to General Care benefit being calculated by reference to the "notional scale of fees" determined retrospectively under the Principal Act in place of the scale of fees determined prospectively under section 40AA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Principal Act requires amendment to ensure that nursing home proprietors have a right of review of authorisations of payments of advance of benefit prior to the determination of the notional scale of fees within three years of the relevant accounting period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, there are a number of amendments that relate to nursing homes which have been granted "exempt bed status". The amendments contained in the bill will address public concern about exempt nursing homes which fail to meet required standards of care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The granting of "exempt bed status" under section 39AB of the act enables a proprietor to charge additional fees to nursing home patients. One of the criteria for granting "exempt bed status" is that the nursing home provides a higher level of accommodation and services than are normally available. However, the current provisions of the act do not enable the revocation or suspension of "exempt bed status" for those nursing homes which have failed to satisfy the standards for nursing and personal care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clearly incongruous to continue to allow a nursing home to charge additional amounts for a supposed increased level of accommodation and services, when the level of nursing and personal care fails to meet the basic standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to suspend or revoke "exempt bed status" is to be subject to internal review,as well as review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 is to specify directly the Health Ministers to be consulted by the Minister before appointing the Chairperson of the Council, the Chairperson of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a Principal Committee of the Council, and the member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee classified as a person with knowledge of the ethics of medical research. Currently the act provides that the Minister is to consult in relation to these appointments with the other members of the Australian Health Ministers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The composition of that membership can of course vary from time to time and currently includes the New Zealand Minister for Health. The proposed amendment would specify that it is the Health Minister of each State and Territory who is to be consulted in relation to the appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill incorporates and reintroduces all the provisions of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 in regard to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, as considered by both Houses of Parliament last session, and differs from that bill in the addition of one further minor amendment to correct an unintended consequence of a clause in the original legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As outlined in my second reading speech for the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995, the amendments included in this bill will establish a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) to cut product approval time to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality, or safety of the medicinal products. The bill provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the National Regulatory Scheme for Therapeutic Goods, which have been identified in its first 4 years of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A mechanism to address shortages, or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the act, the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce the legislation. Also included in the bill are changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the "penalty units" classification used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation, as well as closing a gap in the current scheme, in regard to the removal of illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality safety and efficacy from the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A definition for "food" has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs. Problems have arisen from the present definition of "therapeutic goods" which excludes "food" but fails to define the term. What constitutes "food" in the bill will be linked to the presentation and promotion of a product in the market. The words "prescribed dose" and "frequency of administration" included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments in the bill include a provision to replace the Therapeutic Goods Administration Trust Account with the Therapeutic Goods Administration Reserve, consistent with changes to be made by the proposed Financial Management Accountability Bill 1995 and related bills that will replace the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This will ensure that technical and scientific data that should be lodged in connection with a general marketing application, will be evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the new provision in the bill, the legislation currently provides that where therapeutic goods are refused marketing approval within Australia they may still be included in the ARTG as listed goods for export only. The secretary is empowered to require confirmation that the relevant authority of the country to which the goods are to be exported is willing to accept the goods. The secretary's power is currently confined to goods that have been manufactured in Australia for export only, and does not extend to products imported into Australia solely for re export.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that this provision be amended to ensure that the secretary's ability to require confirmation from Australia's trading partners of their willingness to accept goods refused marketing approval in Australia, extends to all products, irrespective of whether they have been manufactured in Australia or elsewhere.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On balance, the coalition does not oppose the principle of the negotiated bulk payments of quantum of double dipped benefits according to a formula agreed between government and compensation payers. It is important that there is no administration tax relating to these arrangements. We accept the government's contention that insurers and other compensation payers were prepared to wear this type of arrangement in return for the waiver of fees, charges and given notification arrangements. We can see the benefits of these arrangements for small amounts of Medicare or nursing home benefits in respect of a given claim, but we do not accept that this is the best option or that compensation payers accepted it with anything but the greatest reluctance. It is a complex structure and will be costly for the compensation payers to service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication is that insurers and Workcover authorities will have to gear up to adjust to the data and administrative demands of the Health Insurance Commission, rather than the other way round. Indeed, this seems to be the way of this government. Rather than using that well-worn line, `I'm from the government, we're here to help you,' it is a case of this government telling compensation payers, `Complain as much as you like, but we are here to help you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also place on record the coalition's general view that, if these arrangements do work and absorb most of the insurance related claims, as the government argues, the revenue that would have been generated from this so-called administrative fee would have dropped to almost nothing. This simply reinforces the absurdity of the administration charge proposals. We note the undertaking of the government to review these arrangements after a period of time. I can assure the Senate that the coalition, in the likely event of being in government after the next election, will be reviewing these arrangements after 12 months of operation. We reserve our right to amend these and other arrangements in this bill if they prove inefficient, unfair or overly expensive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) are in no doubt as to the necessity for this legislation, particularly in so far as it has addressed the problem of double-dipping in health and community services programs by those who are eligible for payments of compensation under the abovementioned schemes. However, we are more concerned that the federal government has to date shown little interest in addressing the many problems which exist in the area of occupational health and safety and particularly those which affect working women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost without exception, these important issues have been neglected by successive governments in Australia. I am seeking to present some of my comments in relation to this at the third reading stage because, unfortunately, I was not able to raise these matters during the second reading debate. However, I acknowledge that the Greens have been pleased to support the changes that have been passed in the committee stage and would just like to put on the public record some of these concerns which relate to cost shifting in workers compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are nine major workers compensation schemes in operation in Australia, one for workers in each state and territory and one specifically for federal government employees. Moreover, under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988&mdash;formerly known as the CERC Act 1988, as amended&mdash;licences have been granted to two federal government corporations, Australia Post and Telecom, empowering them to manage their own compensation claims and to administer rehabilitation programs for their injured employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recently released report of the federal government's Industry Commission on workers compensation suggests that there is invidious competition between these various schemes, which was based partly on who could shift the most workers compensation costs onto individuals or onto the taxpayer funded health or social security systems. This report makes nonsense of the claims by insurers and compensation payers that they do not cost shift to the Commonwealth and that they fully meet their obligations to fund the treatment of those with compensable injuries. By their very nature, compensation insurers are driven by the profit motive. It is unrealistic to expect them to always act in the best interests of injured workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not seem to matter whether the compensation insurer is a private commercial enterprise or a federal government agency or corporation, cost shifting is rampant. In Western Australia, an organisation known as the Injured Persons Action and Support Association, or IPASA, owes its very existence to the injustices suffered by many injured persons as a result of exercises in cost shifting perpetrated by compensation insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IPASA has repeatedly drawn attention to Telecom's campaign of harassment and victimisation of those of its employees who developed RSI in the early to mid-1980s. Telecom, well known for its insensitivity in these matters, continues this cynical exercise in cost shifting to the community, as evidenced by its insistence that many of those women be regularly examined by a doctor flown in from Adelaide. In fact, that doctor was the very doctor who coined the term `kangaroo paw'. Telecom prospers mightily in the 1990s, but it does so over the bodies of many of its female workers who were injured in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> IPASA also exposed the nefarious exploits of certain of Australia Post's compensation delegates in WA. These revelations resulted in the then state manager apologising in person to one of his employees who, as a result of the continued harassment directed against him and his psychiatrist by the compensation section, had been driven to the point of contemplating suicide. According to IPASA, there have been many other injured persons employed by Australia Post who have been unfairly deprived of their compensation entitlements and forced onto social security benefits by these zealous delegates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 Comcare laid down fairly stringent claims management standards for licensees under the act. However, its own claims management practices have attracted criticism. Areas of complaint outlined in the IPASA newsletter of November-December 1994 included: the fairness and rationality of decision making on some claims, both new and long-established ones; continuation of the practice of doctor shopping; incorrect interpretation of medical reports; removal of rights to compensation and rehabilitation without adequate reason; and interference in the medical referral process. Clearly, if Comcare cannot get its own house in order, it is hardly in the best position to ensure maintenance of claims management standards by those to whom it has granted licences under the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state compensation system in WA has recently been extensively overhauled by the Court government. The major changes to legislation were specifically designed to remove lawyers from the system and to thus curtail cost. A conciliation and review directorate was established to speedily resolve disputes between employers and injured workers. Although it had to cope with a huge backlog of cases left over from the previous system, the government claims that the directorate has been an outstanding success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, an upper house committee of review has recommended that major significant changes be made to the system of dispute resolution. This criticism is not unexpected when one realises that the directorate commenced its operations with `conciliators' who were untrained in conciliation, with review officers devoid of legal training and with ad hoc medical panels selected from a list of those doctors volunteering to serve on them&mdash;for a fee of $400 per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering that disputes can be, and often are, created at the whim of the insurer, injured workers often find that the conciliation process is a complete waste of their time. In addition, when they do have to attend conciliation and review hearings without legal representation, injured workers find themselves opposed by experienced insurance personnel representing their employer. This is obviously a most inequitable situation. As the promised speedy resolution of compensation disputes has not eventuated in WA, there has probably been no alteration in the extent of cost shifting to the Commonwealth practised by compensation insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article published last year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>, Emeritus Professor David Ferguson reviewed the past 80 years of occupational medicine in Australia. His conclusion is relevant to this debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has always been backward in providing safe conditions for workers. Occupational physicians have had to battle indifference, if not active opposition . . . Unsafe conditions are still accepted when the means of their prevention have been known since the beginning of the century. Political expedience, not science, has determined outcomes . . . The great majority of workers are not covered by specialist work [health] advice. Disparate State policies, programs, priorities, standards and laws lead to unequal worker protection and double standards apply. A poor quality of working life often still exists.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from `Eighty years of occupational medicine in Australia' by D. A. Ferguson, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> 1994:161:40. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia women who are injured at work fare less well than work injured men. This conclusion was reached by Worksafe Australia in its report of October 1994 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Occupational health and safety: the experience of women workers, Australia, 1991-92</EMPHASIS>. In response to this report, the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Gary Johns, said, `The findings suggest that a special focus on women's workplace safety is needed if their problems are to be addressed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When his government's record on this matter is scrutinised, the assistant minister's remarks would hardly inspire much confidence amongst the working women of Australia. When RSI became so prevalent over 10 years ago, the health and safety of women in the workplace was prominently placed on the political agenda. However, it was quietly taken off the agenda by this federal government when economic expediency became the order of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 Worksafe Australia's working party on repetition strain injury expressed concern both at the high degree of emotional and anecdotal debate on RSI and at the attitudinal barriers of racial origin and gender which could prevent sufferers from receiving appropriate and early attention. The report was severely criticised on the grounds that it failed to properly address these issues and that its authors appeared oblivious to the medico-legal conflicts which were proving so distressing to RSI sufferers. Such conflicts often resulted in great economic hardship for sufferers as well as interruption or curtailment of their working careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many with RSI the not infrequent consequences of having this diagnosis applied to them were harassment and victimisation, family relationship problems, social isolation, loss of their former self-image and depressive illness. Other complaints by women with RSI included denial of access to correct medical management, to rehabilitation and to psychological support. The federal government and Worksafe Australia prefer to downplay and then to ignore these major problems affecting working women, perhaps hoping that they will just go away. Now, like the proverbial scapegoat, they have returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his foreword to the 1994 report, the Chief Executive of Worksafe Australia, Dr Edward Emmett, admitted, `The causes and solutions for many occupational health and safety problems women experience have not received as much research or attention as those commonly found in many male dominated occupations.' The Greens (WA) see this admission as being one of guilt as well as a national disgrace. We look to the federal government for a positive commitment to rectify this matter. Buck-passing or, as it is known, cost shifting is only a symptom of a more widespread illness which exists within our society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. This is an omnibus tax bill which contains 17 different measures. The bill is not opposed by the opposition; indeed, the coalition is strongly supportive of many of the changes contained in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A popular cliche claims that all good things come to those who wait. In this instance we have had to wait a long, long time, so in this case there must be a whole lot of good in this bill. So long have we waited that this bill has had to change its name to get debated in this chamber. I must inform you that the bill was once known as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994&mdash;a change of name, but still another tax bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have noted already, the bill contains no less than 17 different measures. Those measures could be separated into three categories: business taxation, personal taxation and tax administration. The most significant changes are in the area of business taxation and administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At an administrative level, this bill contains a significant advance in the presentation of taxation legislation that should in future prove a valuable tool for the parliament. I refer to the inclusion of compliance cost impact statements. These statements were recommended by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts following its inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative is important for two reasons. It will provide an indication to taxpayers of the estimated cost of complying with particular changes in the tax laws. More importantly though, these statements will necessitate government actually considering the cost they impose on our economy&mdash;that is, on the people of Australia&mdash;of administering the government's taxation policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always easy for governments, particularly those that have been in power for 12 years, like this government, to believe that every tax change they introduce can be implemented without cost. It is easy to believe that governments should be required to only consider making good laws and that it is for the citizens to obey those laws regardless of the administrative costs of doing so. Such a view of the world is highly dangerous as it suggests that we are in this place to impose laws on the citizens of Australia rather than to make laws on behalf of those citizens. It is important to remember this distinction, especially with tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say quite plainly that I welcome the development of these impact statements. I do wonder, however, how serious the Labor government is about this reform. How serious is the government about informing Australians how much taxation changes will cost them? When I look at these statements, I have to ask how much effort is being devoted to estimating the cost of compliance. Could it be that the government cannot make these calculations? Maybe they can; maybe they cannot. If they can, then I believe the general statements which are contained in this bill are insufficient. It is important that people be able to appreciate the cost of our taxation system; that is, the cost of compliance. Perhaps the tax office has found it just too hard to comply with this requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government cannot make these calculations, what does it say about our tax laws? If they are too complicated and their impact is too uncertain, then how does the government expect taxpayers to apply the law in the first place? It is a simple principle which I will state again: if a law is so complicated that the costs of complying with the law cannot be measured, then, in my opinion, that law is a bad law. I can only say in summary on this opening point that the coalition supports the further development of tax impact statements for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Mr Paul Keating's seven years as Treasurer of our country he increased the annual taxation take from just over $44 billion to an astounding $93 billion.

And, of course, worse than that, since he has been Prime Minister borrowings have gone from $30 billion and are expected to be $100 billion at the end of this year.

The proposed changes to the civil penalties and taxation offences contained in part 1 of schedule 2 of the bill derive from recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The amendments are designed to ensure that taxpayers are not subject to an administrative penalty under taxation laws for an act or omission which gives rise to prosecution of the taxpayer under those laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes ensure that the Taxation Office must choose one path and one path only for seeking redress against a taxpayer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. This bill has been around for a long time. In fact, last year it was called Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994. It has had a long gestation period. The thrust of the legislation, as my colleague Senator Gibson said, has the approval of the opposition. However, in matters of detail we would have preferred certain alternative routes. Perhaps four or five years ago my attention was drawn to a series of situations whereby taxpayers, having been caught with an administrative penalty, also found themselves before the courts. They were in a double jeopardy position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was subsequently taken up with the Public Accounts Committee which brought forward a recommendation. That recommendation has now seen its way into law in that the measure will remove the power of the commissioner to impose or reimpose an administrative penalty where there has been a prosecution for the same offence or omission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an omnibus bill that we are looking at today and the Taxation Office ombudsman will be established within the office of the Commonwealth ombudsman. It effectively means that when the ombudsman or ombudswoman is dealing with taxation matters he or she will be called the taxation ombudsman or ombudswoman. I am pleased to see that there is an allocation of additional resources for the review of ATO action and that will improve the equity of the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are yet to see the taxpayers' charter. I hope that this will be more than an administrative document or aide-memoire to taxation auditors and is actually enshrined within the legislation. The small claims tribunal is yet to be established. I have been invited to participate in a workshop on Monday to look into the mechanics of setting up such a small claims tribunal, and I welcome that because there is a problem about the cost of tax justice. All too often we have seen where, if there is a dispute between the taxpayer and the taxation auditors, the taxpayer can take it on appeal if he is dissatisfied. Quite often the amounts involved do not warrant the costs and the hassles accompanying such an appeal. Reasonable amounts of money for small businesses or taxpayers can be involved. I believe that the alternative of a small claims tribunal is the appropriate way to go in providing an independent adjudication of such issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment to which I wish to refer concerns the payment of instalments by companies. When the government reduced the income tax company rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, as part of the trade-off it decided to bring forward the time schedule within which payments had to be made. Initially, in the euphoria of a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate, a lot of people accepted the concept of perhaps having to pay their tax somewhat earlier. But the proposal was more draconian than people had envisaged. The tax rate has now moved up from 33 per cent to 36 per cent and people are caught with these very tight schedules for meeting company tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An instalment taxpayer is liable to pay tax instalments under the new company tax instalment regime in accordance with a table contained in section 221AZK(2). Under the table, the timing of the amounts of the payments differ depending upon whether the instalment taxpayer is classified as small, medium or large. Under subsection (3) of that section of the act the taxpayer's likely tax for the current year is calculated in the first day of month nine. It is possible for a taxpayer to have more than one amount of likely tax on the first day of month nine. This may happen where an estimate is lodged during that day. Accordingly, section 221AZK(3) has been amended to make it clear that an instalment taxpayer will only be classified as at the end of the first day of month nine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that, as part of a deal of reducing tax, the government brought the tax instalments forward. But there is no leniency because the tax rates have gone up and the instalment rates will not be brought back. As a result, there is going to be quite an added cash flow put onto taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the legislation there are provisions in relation to the valuation of livestock involving the cost price of natural increase of livestock. We have amendments to the law which will ensure that the natural increase of livestock, for which no minimum value is prescribed, is valued at its actual cost. Taxpayers can elect to value stock at its actual cost. I acknowedge that the effect of the amendment is to eliminate an inappropriate deferral of tax but, with some new primary production type varieties, if the absorption cost method is used you can have an exceedingly high value placed on your natural increase vis-a-vis other items of traditional livestock for which there are prescribed minimum values such as sheep, horses, goats, and pigs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some discussions with officers of the Taxation Office and they assure me that efforts are being made to contact primary producers and their associations at state and national level to try to accommodate such new varieties to expedite the setting of minimum prescribed values. I seek assurances from the minister that arrangements have been made today in terms of meeting the undertaking that the Taxation Office will use its best endeavours to get minimum values applied as expeditiously as possible. This would certainly apply to new varieties such as alpaca and emu. Without that assurance, in the initial years there will be a higher tax payable even though there may be limited sales due to the application of the increases in natural livestock items. We will have the high cost associated with the application of the absorption cost placed on closing stock values and this will enhance the closing stock amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an interesting feature in the superannuation guarantee, and this is an area in which I have some interest. The bill extends the present annual superannuation guarantee contribution requirements under the superannuation regime to 1994-95 and later years until the regime is more established. This is somewhat curious because, obviously, where an employer receives an employee contribution it must be remitted within a month. But the employer's responsibilities and obligations can be met only by a once a year payment. I would have thought that perhaps the gestation period would have been well and truly satisfied. From the way that the explanatory memorandum is worded, it appears that it can go for quite a few years yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that there is no cost to revenue, but I notice in other areas where the collection period is being brought forward there is a gain to revenue as a result of the earlier collection of money. In a sense I suppose that is correct because if it has never been collected in advance in the past a decision not to change the method will not result in any change to revenue. With the development of superannuation and its basic acceptance, I think perhaps quarterly instalments would be somewhat more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next item concerns the capital gains tax. It ensures that there will be a liability for capital gains when an asset is created and held by its creator as the trustee of a discretionary trust. That will apply in circumstances where there is a future interest, say, in a professional partnership. It is an anti-avoidance measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eligible investment income of registered organisations includes, in the assessable income of friendly societies and certain other registered organisations, income derived from certain assets within the organisation. I would like to take this opportunity to express my concern about the increased tax impositions placed by this government on friendly societies. Friendly societies were established to help the less well off in the community but, as a result of changes in the tax legislation, those societies are being forced to move towards clients which they have not traditionally done a lot of business with in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the use of the tax file number, perhaps, I think they could well be developing products to assist those less well off in the community, provided that the societies themselves with particular investment incomes had a lower friendly society rate. I know that this government is very keen on having level playing fields, but I think it is somewhat unfortunate that, as a result of tax changes, you are deliberately forcing certain types of institutions either out of business or to deal with other than what has been their traditional client base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), representing the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), to look again at the taxation of friendly societies. Perhaps nowadays, with the sophistication of the tax file number system, you might be able to develop a range of tax rates to suit the particular income levels of those members of the community who are not, say, in the top quartile. I am referring here to those members that friendly societies traditionally dealt with, the less well off&mdash;those people who sought to form an association to improve their lot in life and to provide for their security. I use this opportunity to flag that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also includes changes to life assurance companies in regard to dividends payable to life assurance companies which are satisfied through the issue of bonus shares and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue of interest is the notice of ruling. The bill before the parliament will make changes whereby, when a ruling is made by the Commissioner of Taxation, a notice of the taxation ruling will be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Gazette</EMPHASIS>. This measure removes any uncertainty about when a public ruling is made. I notice there is also a table for the information. I think that is a good move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that worries me in relation to rulings is that I am not sure that there is the appropriate oversight of all rulings, with the result that there is still a lot of shopping around going on amongst the various tax offices to get the best ruling under the circumstances. You can go around to a particular branch of the tax office and apply that ruling which suits you best. In other words, there is not enough liaison within the Taxation Office itself. There does not seem to be an officer who is actually in overall control of these rulings. I think the shopping around for rulings is an unfortunate practice that is developing, and certainly it is one I would like to see stopped as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, there are some minor amounts, such as the rounding down of tax liabilities to the nearest 5c. There are some good measures in relation to panel vans and utility trucks. One-tonners or more are treated in the same manner throughout the taxation law, irrespective of whether they are derived from passenger motor vehicles. This has been an impediment in the past. Some time ago I brought in a private member's bill drawing attention to the problems associated with that, and the unfair advantage that, say, imported vehicles had at the time over local vehicles. Of course, my private member's bill did not cover the same matters as this legislation but it dealt with the same sorts of issues, including derivatives of passenger vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that measure is welcomed, as indeed are the measures relating to social security changes. I think they will be welcomed by those people in receipt of disability support pensions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not heard from the minor parties or from the Independent, but this is an omnibus bill cleaning up a lot of not minor but important and detailed applications of the taxation act, so it is not surprising that they would not come here to simply voice their approval.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do so, though, might I say that I have noted the broad remarks of Senator Watson and Senator Gibson and, in Senator Watson's case, particularly his observations about the superannuation guarantee and about the capital gains tax provisions; the entreaty he made on the taxation of friendly societies&mdash;that is, that the societies were for the less well off&mdash;when he referred to the reasons for the formation of those societies and how the tax laws apply; and his comments on shopping around for rulings and, in Senator Watson's view, the need for a proper, more centralised oversight of that to prevent such shopping around. I mention these things now so that they will appear in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as being acknowledged as points by the government, and so that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), whom I represent in this debate, can have them explicitly drawn to his attention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the cost price of natural increase of livestock, can I say that a number of groups which represent breeders of exotic birds and animals have expressed concern about the proposed new basis for valuing natural increases, and that is because there have been no prescribed minimum values for these exotic species. They include things like emus, ostriches, crocodiles and alpacas&mdash;I think Senator Watson referred to emus and alpacas&mdash;but obviously the list could be longer.

The national body representing emu breeders, for example, has worked closely with the ATO in developing a minimum value for emu chicks.

The government's intentions, can I say through you to Senator O'Chee and the rest of the chamber, are to proceed with order of the day No. 3, the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill, to the end of the second reading stage. At that time the government will propose that the next order of business be No. 5, Standing Committee on Procedure, consideration of first report of 1995. Order of the day No. 4, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill, resumption of the second reading debate, would not be proceeded with as it appears on the Notice Paper and order of the day No. 8, the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill, would not be promoted out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill is a timely attempt to make the anti-syphoning laws in the Broadcasting Services Act more workable. As we know, the anti-syphoning laws were designed to protect free-to-air broadcasts of events which are deemed to have national or cultural significance. The Democrats are strong supporters of the objectives of that legislation. Viewers should not be forced to pay to see major events that they normally see free of charge. Economists would, of course, argue that people do pay for so-called free-to-air broadcasts: our taxes pay for the national broadcasters and our consumer spending funds the advertising revenue which keeps the commercial networks going. But a pay TV subscription comes on top of those existing imposts. It is an additional cost which many Australians either cannot afford or do not want. Because of technical limitations, many Australians cannot receive pay TV broadcasts even if they want to. Free-to-air coverage is far more comprehensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, the Democrats also believe that the present system is flawed and needs to be improved. In trying to describe what is wrong with the present system, it is hard to know where to start. The first problem is that this list is too long. It contains events which are not normally screened in Australia. It is hard to see how an event which has never been screened here can be classified as highly significant to the Australian public. It is particularly hard to understand how Australians can be used to seeing an event free of charge when it has not been shown on our free-to-air networks at all. The fact that some events of this kind are on the list shows how much the government has departed from the original concept. I am not a conspiracy theorist but I can understand why it has been rumoured that this list was basically drawn up by the networks. For example, free-to-air viewers have never seen a test or a one-day cricket series played in India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka, yet they are all on the list. The tour of Pakistan was by all accounts very exciting but was not screened here. Nor was the 1994 Australia-New Zealand Davis Cup match, even though that too was on the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber did have the option of trying to make the list more balanced by using our disallowance power. The Democrats considered taking that step at the time. We decided not to proceed because disallowance would have been too blunt an instrument. The list was drafted in such a way that we would have had to strike off many events which actually should be on it. This would have created a vacuum while a new list was drafted and gazetted. The result could have been chaotic and counter-productive, so we dropped that idea at the time. But the fact remains that the list is too generous, and that is one cause of the problems which we are now experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem is that the delisting procedure is too restrictive. It is wide open to legal challenge by a very litigious industry. It does not allow delisting where a commercial network hoards rights by buying them but not showing the events solely to prevent them from being screened on pay TV. In the Democrats' view this bill will help to solve that problem. It provides the minister with a more useable mechanism to amend the list. It proposes a completely discretionary power to add or to delete items from the list, subject to the approval of both houses of parliament. It blocks off the avenues for legal challenge which would otherwise constrain the exercise of that power. Ordinarily, such a wide discretion might be seen as unfair and even dangerous. However, this is a special case. The anti-syphoning provisions give the free-to-air broadcasters special privileges and these should not extend to an open invitation to take the minister to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, it is essential that guidelines be developed to help the minister exercise those powers consistently and transparently. The note in the amending bill gives some guidance on when the minister might exercise power to delist an event. The note does not, however, give any guidance on when events might be added to the list. Guidelines for the minister's listing and delisting an event should be developed as a matter of urgency so that the industry can better understand how the minister will use his powers under the act. For example, I am mystified that the Australia-Pakistan one-day series held in October last year is still on that list, even though it was not bought by any free-to-air broadcaster and the minister has been asked by Australis to delist it. Pay TV subscribers deserve better than to wait 11 months to see an event which the free-to-air networks have shown no interest in whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Channel Nine publicly stated that it was happy to have the 1994 series delisted but not any future series, just in case it decides that it wants to screen them in the future. In other words, Channel Nine sees the list as reserving to it a range of choices which it might take up or, then again, it might not. It hardly needs to be said that this is not what the list is for. The list is not an exclusive smorgasbord for the optional consumption of the free-to-air networks. If the networks are not deadly serious about screening an event then it should not be on that list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third problem is that the act prevents pay TV licensees from acquiring rights to listed events unless free-to-air networks have bought them first. This puts the networks in a strong position to veto a pay TV broadcast or to extract cheap rights from pay licensees instead of paying full price for them in the first place. This is not just a theoretical concern, as Nine has demonstrated in the West Indies case. The only recourse available to pay licensees is to request that the minister delist the event. But the wheels grind very slowly&mdash;far too slowly for that to be any kind of realistic solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this means overall is that if the free-to-air networks do not buy rights to a listed event before it starts, it cannot be shown on pay TV, even if the networks themselves have been unreasonable about it. It does not matter if they were not serious about buying or imposed outrageous conditions; it still cannot be shown by the pay operators. That gives the networks too much leverage. The networks should not have a power of veto over pay broadcasts. If anyone should have that privilege it should be the minister. Given that this bill solves only one of the three problems with the list, I have had an amendment to the anti-syphoning provisions drawn up to make the system operate in a more balanced fashion. The Democrats' amendment would automatically delist an event once it is ended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Automatic delisting will not diminish the public's ability to see most major events live on free-to-air television. As the Australian Broadcasting Authority's recent report on the operation of the list shows, most events on the list are already shown on free-to-air services live. While the ABA's broadcast figures are only for Sydney, and only for six months, they show that over three-quarters of the broadcast hours of list events were broadcast live on free-to-air channels. All of the finals of sporting events were shown live and the majority of delayed broadcasts, comprising only about 14 per cent of the broadcast hours of list events, were delayed broadcasts of international events. Therefore, automatic delisting of the event after it is over would not cut into those live broadcasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What automatic delisting will do is allow pay operators to purchase rights to broadcast an event immediately after it is ended, whether or not free-to-air broadcasters have acquired the rights to that event. It will ensure that pay television operators will be able to broadcast events which the free-to-air broadcasters do not want to broadcast or do not want to broadcast in full. Arguments have been made that automatic delisting would reduce the value of free-to-air broadcasters' rights to list events. That argument ignores the fact that the government's stated policy reason for introducing the list was to ensure that the public did not have to pay to see major events that they could see on free-to-air channels. It is not to preserve or to add to the commercial value of free-to-air rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are also concerned that the act does not provide an easy and a quick way for pay television operators to find out whether events have been acquired by free-to-air broadcasters and whether the acquisition of highlights of an event amounts to acquisition for the purposes of the list. Acquiring rights to programs can be anything from a handshake over dinner to the signing of complex legal documents, yet the outcome in both cases will determine whether pay operators can or cannot bid for the right to the event. There are also events where free-to-air broadcasters do not want to buy rights to more than program highlights, which may or may not amount to acquiring rights to the event. In both cases pay operators need advice on whether or not rights to the event have been acquired for the purposes of the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's office has advised us that the ABA now has sufficient powers to provide such advice to pay operators. Indeed, the ABA's own draft guide to the pay TV anti-syphoning provisions suggests that pay operators can now apply either to the minister or through the ABA to have an event delisted. However, the extent of the ABA's role in advising on acquisitions of rights under the list is not spelled out in the legislation and we would urge the ABA to clarify its powers to advise pay operators as part of its guide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA is also required, by ministerial direction, to report every six months on the operation of the anti-siphoning provisions. We urge the minister to direct the ABA to include in its six monthly report any advice it has given to operators on when rights have been acquired, and when highlights have amounted to the acquisition of rights to the event. The first ABA report on anti-siphoning has finally been made public. We strongly urge the minister to ensure that all future ABA reports on anti-siphoning are also publicly available. The recent spectacle of Messrs Packer and Murdoch combining to form a news channel emphasises the need for our second amendment to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC's pay television licensee AIM has the highest Australian content provisions of any pay operator. AIM's Australian content requirements for general programming go from 25 per cent to 35 per cent during the day and peak viewing hours. The news channel's Australian program content went from 40 to 50 per cent. In contrast, the Murdoch/Packer news channel, according to news reports, will be little more than reruns of free to air news bulletins, with Murdoch's BSkyB providing more foreign input. There will be no additional journalists hired in Australia, and there is little promise that the channel will offer anything new in the way of either Australian or overseas news and information. This sorry state of Australian content of news on pay television is possible because the only Australian content requirement put on all pay TV licensees&mdash;other than AIM&mdash;relates only to Australian drama. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1993, when Australian content on pay TV was debated, I moved an amendment that the required review of broadcasting go beyond pay TV's compliance with drama requirements to at least look at Australian content on news and sport. I am moving the amendment again, but this time to require that any review of pay TV content look at all Australian content provided by the industry. This does not amount to imposing a content requirement, but it does amount to putting the pay TV industry on notice that their provision of new Australian content will be reviewed and, if found wanting, may be subject to further content requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment gives the pay TV industry an opportunity over the next year or so to behave responsibly in providing Australian content and it provides the minister and this parliament with an opportunity to review the industry's performance on overall Australian content and to better understand what requirements, if any, may be needed in the future. The Democrats are very concerned at the increasing concentration of ownership and control exercised by a very few media players across the media industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1993, the Democrats argued for stronger cross media regulation, which included the satellite pay TV operators as well as the press and commercial broadcasters. Once again, this chamber rejected Democrat proposals to strengthen those cross media rules. Unhappily, the two intervening years have, as a result, seen not the diversity of new players promised by the government, but the same old players acquiring more of our media. We are all familiar with Mr Murdoch's domination of the press. We can add to that his interests in free to air broadcasting, pay television, program production and, indeed, ownership of a studio that produces the product. We are also becoming aware of the linkages between Mr Packer's magazine holdings, his interests in Fairfax press, his control over a free to air commercial network and his involvement in pay television. Last Friday, we were treated to the spectacle of those two media barons combining to create a news channel which, perhaps coincidentally, severely threatened the ABC's pay TV news channel. We have seen since then that it has gone down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Democrats' view, enough is enough. That is it; that is where we should stop. The act now requires the ABA, in consultation with the Trade Practices Commission, to monitor cross media ownership of pay television licensees and, if concerned, report to the minister. We now call on the minister, as a matter of urgency, to ask the ABA to report within six months on all cross media linkages between pay TV licensees, people in control of the press, and people in control of commercial radio and television licences. At least then, parliament can be informed of who owns what interest  and, perhaps belatedly and perhaps too late, make more sensible cross media rules which promote real competition and diversity in the pay TV industry&mdash;not the developing cosy duopoly which is now emerging. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the coalition to support the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill. There were some fears that, under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, pay TV operators would be able to buy up exclusive rights to major sporting channels and cultural events; and this would force viewers to go without or to pay for events that were always free.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the matter came before the parliament in 1992 we have been concerned about the way in which pay television has developed. Given the government's response to many of the developments in pay TV and in telecommunications generally, we do not have a lot of confidence that the government got this matter right initially. Certainly we do not have a lot of confidence that this bill is the complete answer. One of the things I want to do today is go through some of the ways in which the original legislation was flawed and go through some of the problems that are still presented by the amendments before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecommunications and broadcasting are areas where we need the government to be completely on the ball, because of the very dynamic and rapidly changing nature of this whole area. We have splendid opportunities for Australia, if the government gets telecommunications right. With the whole pay TV area we have the opportunity to create an enormous new area for Australia, for the development of our industry and, most importantly given the current debate, for employment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that when matters come before the parliament, when we have legislation before parliament to set the guidelines as to how an industry is to develop&mdash;and we set the regulations for an industry&mdash;that these matters are not considered fully and the wisest possible decision is not made. A lot of the reason for this goes back to the way the minister operates in this field. Minister Lee has a history of reacting to problems and not having the foresight or developing the planning strategies to head them off in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole area of pay TV, specifically the free list problem, demonstrates that lack of planning to start with. We have seen it in other areas of the communication network&mdash;and in the development of broadband services generally. We have seen it specifically in pay TV from the time of the Senate pay TV inquiry. We saw how inept this government was in handling this matter. I was deputy chair of the pay TV inquiry that first looked at developments in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was about 18 months ago that we had that inquiry. What has absolutely amazed me is how rapidly this field has developed and how the landscape in pay television now looks so totally different from how it looked at the time of the pay TV inquiry. That is why a wise government would have set out at that point a regulatory framework that was comprehensive enough and had sufficient foresight to foresee some of the problems that were going to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Collins had a very poor start in that whole area. I remind the Senate of the basic nature of that start. When the minister was setting up the first licences in pay television, he had a determination before him which he signed without reading. It was for an auctioning system for the pay television channels on satellite. That auctioning system did not require any sort of deposit. This led to a number of collapsing bids, meaning that one series of companies could put in a number of bids. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They put in bids at certain prices. When the first bid failed, it then collapsed to the next one. Guess what? It was the same company. If it dropped to the next one, it was the same company, and so it went on. This lack of foresight by the government delayed this whole process for many months. That is just inexcusable for a government. How many public servants do we employ in these departments to watch over these matters, yet the whole thing ended up a total debacle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now seen that series of events played to its final conclusion. Australis was one of the companies that was successful in buying it. There are now suggestions that it will merge with Foxtel. In the days when we had that inquiry&mdash;I remind the Senate that it was only 18 months ago&mdash;Foxtel did not exist. With the involvement of News Ltd and Telstra, it was not even on the horizon. Yet we now have that company emerging as a media mega-monster. Optus Vision, the Optus group and a number of television stations are emerging as the second huge player. The smaller players, unfortunately, are being squeezed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given that preamble to all this to indicate the great necessity for government to have some foresight in the problems that they are dealing with, to plan well in advance and to hire the best possible experts to help them map the way through, which this government should follow to come out with the best possible outcomes in an area which will be a booming part of our economy. If this government gets it wrong&mdash;in many instances so far, it does not give us a great deal of confidence that it has the right direction on this&mdash;industries that could develop will not develop, and that is a great tragedy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are considering here today is tied basically into the matters of the anti-siphoning list for pay TV. One would have thought that it is basically a fairly simple and straightforward matter. You do have a list. On the basis of that list, you can tell what events should be on pay TV and what events should be left free to air. Indeed, the minister came out very boldly early in this process and seemed to be saying that he would set up this list and that all these events were going to be available to people who did not want to purchase pay TV rights. We were happy with that initially. But when it hit its very first test, which was the Windies test last year, they ran into trouble. Viewers had to go without or pay for events that they had always viewed for free. Such events included the football code grand final, the Melbourne cup, cricket tests and one-day cricket matches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response was to list events under the Broadcasting Services Act which should be, in the opinion of the minister, available free to the public. The object of the anti-siphoning list was that viewers would continue to see major sports events for free. But, as I have foreshadowed, the government's legislation on this occasion was hopelessly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government made a promise that audiences listening to their normal station would be able to watch their cricket, rugby league or whatever. Minister Lee made a mess of that promise. The principal act did not ensure that they had these rights. The legislation simply said that a commercial channel had to be given the right to show the sporting events. This explains the key purpose of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's intention is to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to ensure that free to air broadcasters cannot hoard rights they obtain through the operation of the anti-siphoning list. The bill seeks to clarify the discretion of the Minister for Communications and the Arts to vary the free list of sporting events. The minister recognises that the principal act is flawed. Minister Lee now sees the need to vary the free list to sporting events which may not be acquired by pay TV operators until acquired by free to air TV operators. This legislation was originally referred to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. This committee took evidence from the major free to air and pay TV stakeholders in February this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strident criticisms of this Labor government's conduct on this matter were well canvassed during this inquiry. The government made a phoney promise which it did not keep. Its incompetent legislation meant that it could not keep its solemn promise about the major sport and free to air availability. The ALP legislation was clearly inadequate. They have made a mess of it again, and the West Indies series cricket fiasco highlighted this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA report into the acquisition of the broadcasting rights for the 1995 Australian cricket tour of the West Indies is now publicly available. The report is dated 7 March 1995. Minister Lee consistently said that the ABA preliminary report advised that the series was on the anti-siphoning list. All the parties&mdash;Nine and Australis&mdash;conducted their negotiations on this basis. The ABA report&mdash;I have a copy of it from the minster's office&mdash;advises that the West Indies series was not covered by the list. This minister had grossly misled parliament, the networks and the public on this issue. He has sat on the contents of this advice from the ABA. I repeat that these matches were not subject to the anti-siphoning rules, and the minister knew this. He has proven his deceit in this matter relating to the ABA report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the Broadcasting Services Bill 1994 seek to clarify the discretion of the Minister for Communications and the Arts to vary the free list of sporting events, the anti-siphoning list. The sporting and cultural events on this list may not be acquired by pay TV until acquired by the free to air operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has two principal effects. It removes the reference to live televising. This clarifies the intent of the act but removes the only reference to the quality of the broadcast to be provided by free to air operators. The other effect is to give the Minister for Communications and the Arts complete discretion to vary the anti-siphoning list. This is freedom to list or de-list sport and cultural events at ministerial whim. This could be against the interests of regional Australia particularly, as was mentioned earlier by my colleague, which has little access to pay TV services. So, if it ends up on pay TV, it is bad luck if you are in the country. You will not be able to access it anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government has created, with its legislative approach, an anti-siphoning maze. A regulatory regime to allow Australians to continue to see sport on TV that they now see free of charge simply does not work. The principal acts and these amendments are riddled with flaws that will cause problems for the televising of sport and cultural events in Australia. I will show that this Labor government's rules have the potential to cause many problems for free to air TV viewers. The potential for massive problems and doubts has already been realised through what happened with the West Indies test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lee's unworkable anti-siphoning rules came up against their first major test over the Australia versus West Indies series. The rules are in tatters. The unseemly brawl over the coverage of this series saw Mr Lee cash in his independence to side firstly with the Nine Network. He then sided with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), not surprisingly, who forced his hand. Minister Lee had to take his riding instructions from Mr Keating, do a breathtaking backflip and then support the Galaxy pay TV operator. This Windies TV coverage fiasco has exposed Labor, and especially Minister Lee, as incompetent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government's legislation simply does not achieve what it has promised the Australian people. Labor promised faithfully to all the low income earners who rely on free to air telecasts that they would not be forced to pay for the events that they now see for free. Such events include the AFL, the rugby league, the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, the rugby and international cricket. These low income earners were feeling very cheated by Labor over Windies cricket until Network 10 threw the minister the lifeline that he so desperately needed. The coalition was relieved, on behalf of Australian sports lovers, that commercial reality overcame the minister's unworkable rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Network 10 had rescued the minister. It is a vote for the free list concept. The minister is not off the hook as he has admitted that similar battles on coming sports events are still likely to occur. Only good fortune and Network 10 sorted out the Windies fiasco and can guarantee that this ALP government's unworkable rules will be put to the test again shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House do not oppose the bill. We support the principle of the free list of major sporting events and cultural events. The coalition is committed to maximising free to air coverage and to making it work, but this bill does fall short of fixing the TV anti-siphoning rules that we all know do not work. There are currently a large number of problems with the operation of the current act, and this bill does nothing to address those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me raise some of the specific questions that the industry&mdash;that is, pay and free to air operators&mdash;and the public still want answered: free to air operators blocking pay TV access to listed events by dragging out negotiations and then not acquiring the rights until the last minute and free to air broadcasters refusing to acquire rights to a listed event thereby denying pay TV operators the opportunity to get the pay TV rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of this situation was the Australia versus Pakistan cricket test and the one day series last October. Free to air networks could buy both free to air and pay TV rights and then hoard the pay TV rights to stymie the other pay TV operators. The New South Wales Rugby League is an example of this with Channel 9 holding the free to air and pay TV rights. Here, uncovered or partially covered matches would be unavailable to pay TV operators and their viewers. The definition of an event is confusing as the free to air operators may televise highlights only and pay TV operators may be prevented from carrying the event at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also ask: when does the haggling over price, conditions, et cetera, become hoarding by the networks? The minister is not required to exercise the power under this legislation to list or delist an event if national or commercial free to air stations have not acquired the rights within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another weakness of the current provisions is that there is no objective criteria for the inclusion of an event. Also, there is no objective process for removing an event. Section 115 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 also promised that free to air audiences listening to normal commercial ABC-SBS stations would see the cricket, or whatever, free as always. The legislation still does not ensure this. It simply says that a commercial or national channel has the first right to show it. So one small regional TV station with pay TV connections could buy the free to air rights and show the event to a small free to air audience and then in the major cities and regional towns the events would only be available by pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Minister Lee and this Labor government are facing their worst fears because of the inadequate legislation they have created: the prospect of presiding over a media environment where a paying elite will have privileged access to major Australian sporting and cultural events. On the other hand, the TV anti-siphoning law seems to treat in some circumstances pay TV operators very unfairly. Minister Lee must ensure that this legislative mess is fixed otherwise it will be treated to a similar unedifying spectacle every time subscriptions and free to air networks are both attracted to major sporting events. This legislation fixes some of the problems but it does not fix all the problems. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has been stumbling and lurching on the verge of the pay TV revolution to get this bill to the stage it is at today. There is absolutely no doubt that all Australians will be affected by the pay TV revolution. We have already seen the preliminaries in this matter with the Super League wars between the Murdoch forces and the existing conservative forces. I think the Australian public has been surprised by the depth of those wars, and no doubt surprised by the possible money involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without all forms of sport crossing over to pay TV, you really have to wonder how pay TV can pay for itself. It is little wonder that we are all witnessing the depth and strength of the wars, as highlighted by the Super League and the rugby league wars that are going on at the moment. That is the essence and the profit making area of pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent upon this parliament to be prepared for the onslaught of pay TV, the hundreds of channels that Australian households will have access to. We need to be prepared in two specific areas. The first is the fact of competition. It is important that we maintain the strength of competition in the pay TV and free to air industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission or the soon to be formed Australian Competition Commission will play a leading role in that area. We have read in the papers of late about the merger of Galaxy pay TV and Murdoch Foxtel. The Trade Practices Commission is inquiring into that merger and rightly because without competition in this area the Australian public, the consumers, will be the losers. It is incumbent upon the parliament that the existing powers and culture of the Trade Practices Commission be transferred to the Australian Competition Commission and that we closely guard and check the adequacy of competition particularly in the area of media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an area that is incumbent upon the Australian Broadcasting Authority to oversee in the forthcoming revolution in pay TV. There is no doubt that this is a revolution because we have seen in the United States that households have access to literally hundreds of different channels with different programs. The Australian Broadcasting Commission needs stronger powers in this regard than it has at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The free to air television code of conduct is, at the moment, voluntary. Senator Tierney would well know, from his work on the Senate community standards committee, that the Australian Broadcasting Authority, as it stands today, does not have strong enough powers and a strong will in this area. It needs to be restructured so that it is at arms length from the industry and has powers to act upon any breach of the code of conduct or breach of the censorship laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Censorship is a very grey and debatable area. I do not think there are many in this country who believe that there should be no censorship laws at all. Heaven forbid if it were the majority view in this government that there should be no censorship laws on pay TV. I know that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, does not think that. In fact, he has very strong views about establishing a specific channel just for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That being the case, we have to arm the Australian Broadcasting Authority with powers that are similar to those of the Trade Practices Commission. Of late I have been most critical of the lack of governing by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in terms of free to air television. It should worry this parliament how they are going to cope with the array of channels and shows that will be upon us with pay TV. If they cannot cope with the existing four channels, how are they going to cope with the multiple channels under the pay TV system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was evidence of this last year when Channel 9 aired a show called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death on request</EMPHASIS> which dealt with the very sensitive subject of euthanasia. Channel 9 was not in error to put that Dutch program on free to air television, but, I believe, it was in error in terms of the time slot and the rating it gave that program dealing with that sensitive subject. The program had very graphic pictures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It actually showed for the first time&mdash;and this was admitted by Channel 9 executives&mdash;the point of death.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about a matter that is affecting and disadvantaging a large group of pensioners&mdash;a group of pensioners who were the victims of the 1990 Estate Mortgage collapse and who lost money, for many of them their life savings, and who are losing out again. Just as their share values start to rise, the Labor government is cutting back their pensions. Lately the Meridian Trust units have been steadily increasing in paper value, and so the paper value of the shares is on the rise. Many of these shareholders are pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992 budget, this Labor government put legislation through this House which established that unrealised capital gains on shares would be treated as income for the purposes of assessing the pension. We said that we would review that when in government because it was not to come into effect until 1993. Unfortunately, we were not in government to do that. However, we did the best thing we could in opposition; we moved a number of amendments to try to address the issue. A private members bill went through the Senate which tried to repeal the legislation but still the government would not listen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did not do anything about this issue until it was forced to conduct a review when we indicated that we would have a Senate inquiry if it did not have one itself. We set a date by which that inquiry would be held if it did not have its own. The government had Ageing Agendas undertake a review. It was indicated that there were really very severe and serious problems associated with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners who retained their units are now just recovering some of the losses on the Estate Mortgage Trust. They were hopeful that, in the long term, they would recover the majority, if not all, of the losses they sustained. I will give an example of one of those pensioners. In a letter, one pensioner wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to 5th. Nov. 1993 my wife and I jointly held 30,000 units in Estate Mortgage Deposit Trust No. 4 which cost us $30,000. Owing to the collapse of the Estate Mortgage Trust these units were swapped for 10,772 A units in the newly-formed Meridian Investment Trust with a net asset value of $1.00 per unit and a market valve of 50c per unit. Thus our $30,000.00 originally invested in the Estate Mortgage Trust was reduced to a paper amount of $5,386.00&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>so they went from $30,000 to $5,386&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and we sustained a loss of $24,614.00.</PARA>
<PARA>They have steadily been increasing in value. They now have a paper value of $10,449. The letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have retained the units happy in the belief that at least portion of our losses on the Estate Mortgage Trust will be recovered in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA>What happened? They are now told by the Department of Veterans' Affairs that that increase is being assessed as income for the purposes of the pension and that their income per fortnight has gone down. There is case after case like this. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> today you can read about a 75-year-old man in Kilsyth who said last night that he was speechless when told his pension would be cut because of investment units that had never earned him a cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is the same for the person who wrote this letter. The units have never earned them a cent. The units were worth $30,000 and went down to $5,386 but the paper value is now $10,449. None of these units has paid a cent in income and yet the paper increases have been treated as income for the purpose of assessing the pension. Who stands to benefit? In the paper today we read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the Department of Social Security; it is the Labor government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has become an unwitting aide to corporate fishers . . . which see big pickings in the former Estate Mortgage trusts, now listed as the Meridian Investment Trust.</PARA>
<PARA>Do you know what is happening? Those pensioners are having to sell those shares at a devalued price, because they probably will not achieve the price they paid for those shares. Meridian is being disadvantaged because they have actually increased the value of those shares; they have brought the business back to a reasonable level. They are disadvantaged because people are selling the shares, and who is gaining from these pensioners? It is the people who can skim around and pick up these cheaper shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I could say, `I told you so,' because we told the government this when we had this debate in 1992, in 1993, in 1994, in 1995, and I suppose we will still be telling the government in 1996. The changes do not come into effect until July 1996, so there are going to be more pensioners who are caught up in this. This is the work of a government that does not think about the implications and the unintended consequences of its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Eight thousand pensioners are the victims of the Estate Mortgage collapse. Think of them. They are in their 60s, their 70s, their 80s, and I presume in their 90s. I have had some of the most pathetic&mdash;and I use that word pathetic in its real sense, full of pathos&mdash;letters from people in their 80s and 90s writing to me listing details of their investments over the years. They have been frugal with their very limited resources. Some of them have $20,000 or $25,000 as their only asset other than their home and they find they are being caught up in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is not really much choice for these pensioners. Both options&mdash;keeping their shares or selling them&mdash;make them worse off. The choice of pension reduction can mean the difference between, on the one hand, being able to pay the bills and buy necessities and, on the other hand, having to go without. The other choice is to sell the shares after holding on to them for so long and avoid a pension reduction. These people cannot gain anything from their investment. They cannot even get back to where they were before. As I said, the government is giving these pensioners a rough deal. It is giving a great deal to the people who are buying these units. These people who are going around and skimming off these shares are benefiting at the expense of the pensioners who are losing out twice over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues, these sorts of examples, were pointed out to the government over and over again. We asked the government to repeal that legislation. We asked the government to do something about it and nothing is going to be done until July 1996. As far as I am aware, the best that the department can do for these people is to say that the matter is under review. The office of the Minister for Social Security is also hiding behind this statement. Meanwhile, these pensioners are losing out and will have to suffer pension reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he spoke to ACOSS last week the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) issued a press release entitled `A Government committed to Social Justice'. Where is the social justice in this piece of legislation? Where is the social justice for pensioners, 8,000 of them, who have made not one single cent on their investment losing significant amounts of pension? Where is the social justice? That is the question I ask you, Minister McMullan, sitting there, reading away. I hope you can go out and face those 8,000 people and say, `This is what we did. We have taken so long to fix it up. We had to be forced into a review.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will remember, those pensioners. They will remember that they were told they were going to be taken out of the tax system by 1995. They will remember, some of them who are part-pensioners, that they were told they would be taken out of the tax system. They will remember when the next election comes. This is just another example of the appalling attitude that Labor has towards older Australians and pensioners in particular. How long will you continue to ignore them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and over again I receive calls and see cases of Labor discriminating against them and affecting older Australians.

It was interesting in speaking with both the Polynesians and the people from East Turkistan who are in Australia that precisely the same processes of occupation of land, the dilution of the local population by an influx of migrants and the use of that land for purposes which would be intolerable on the home territory were being carried out.</PARA></TALK.START>

More than 250,000 East Turkistanis have died from radiation related illnesses, such as liver cancer and skin cancer. Today we can say that there is not a single East Turkistani who has not been affected by radiation. We have witnessed the affect of this radiation in East Turkistan's famous pear and rock melon exports which are now rejected on the world market and are returned to East Turkistan and sold in local markets by the Chinese.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1864" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question based on advice from Australia Post:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The loss attributed to community service obligations (CSOs) applies to the whole nation. In 1993/94, it was calculated at $62 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSO cost is measured using government determined and approved methodology which uses a model for this calculation based on long-term avoidable cost calculated after deduction of the charge made for the service (ie the net cost).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The methodology provides for costs to be measured for each "mail path" (ie from the point at which a letter enters the network to the point of its delivery). The Australia Post network has 150,000,000 national "mail paths". The CSO costs are calculated from a model which reduces these to a more manageable 350,000 "mail paths". The model provides for the total cost of maintaining the letter service to be distributed over the total number of letters carried on the 350,000 "mail paths". Where the cost per letter on a "mail path" exceeds the revenue it generates, the whole of the "mail path" contributes to the CSO cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approved methodology does not directly attribute costs calculated this way to a "rural and remote CSO" or to a "non rural and remote CSO" because each "mail path" has an origin and destination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as non rural and remote "mail paths" where the net cost exceeds the price charged, the model includes inbound international mail which Australia Post is obliged to deliver under international agreements where the revenue paid for delivery does not meet costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the model also includes other long mail paths with origins and destinations in "non rural and remote areas" (eg Perth to Brisbane). The cost </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of these exceeds the revenue generated, and the net loss is attributed to Australia Post's total CSO cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) Australia Post estimates that the average cost of selling a 45 cent stamp is 4.5 cents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The major elements of this average cost of selling a 45 cent stamp are:</PARA>
<PARA>                                                                 Cents</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Includes such costs as equipment and software, material purchases, uniforms, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) With the exception of `(i) standard letter delivery' all of the services listed are, or include, an element of non-reserved services provided by </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post in open competition with commercial businesses. Australia Post is unable to make public information which competitors could use to their commercial advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post provides aggregate information on revenue and profit/loss for its `reserved' services, and those services which it provides in competition with other businesses, in its annual report. This information from the 1993/94 annual report follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting `(x) retail services generally' aside, all the services listed in the question with the exception of `(v) EDI Post' are covering all their direct and indirect costs and making a contribution to overheads and profit. `(v) EDI Post', is still a developing service carrying significant "start-up" costs. Nevertheless, it is currently meeting all of its direct costs and is expected to meet all its other costs and make a contribution to overheads and profit during the 1996/97 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`(x) retail services generally' includes a range of activities, not a discrete service or set of services priced separately. Services provided through the retail network and priced individually cover their direct and indirect costs and make a contribution to overheads and profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of (i) standard letter delivery, (a) yes it is profitable and (b) the estimated total revenue for 1993/94 was $816M with profit being 6% of revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Australia Post is keenly aware of its responsibilities regarding fair competition. Its pricing practices recognise fully the cost of each product or service offered to the public. This enables identification of cross subsidies between products and services. In recent years, the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Australian National Audit Office have each examined Australia Post's product costing methods and application thoroughly, and endorse its practices. Australia Post assures me that prices of its complementary products, such as greeting cards, packaging and wrapping paper, are not cross-subsidised by its `reserved' services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australia Post has a sophisticated product costing system which accurately matches the revenues and expenditures of all its products and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post's established policy on costing products and services is that all expenditures recorded in the financial accounts are fully distributed to the products and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Results, by product, are closely monitored to ensure there is no cross subsidisation of established products and services. It is possible in the starting phases of a new product or service, eg EDI Post, that positive results are not achieved until target volumes are reached but this outcome never persists for a protracted length of time. In this, Australia Post is no different to any other trading enterprise which introduces a product or service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial separation between reserved and non reserved services, of which complementary services form part, is maintained. This is evidenced at page 73 of Australia Post's 1993/94 Annual Report as indicated in the answer to question (3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Structural separation between reserved and non reserved service is impractical, and would be detrimental to postal customers who value, and benefit from, the integrated services currently provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Australia Post performs its functions, as far as practicable, in accordance with sound commercial practice. In doing so, it purchases goods and services from a range of suppliers, on a strict commercial basis. It enjoys no special advantage in the form of exemption from taxes of any sort, or exemption from State or other laws. Similarly, retail complementary products are marketed and retailed on the open market on a truly "competitively neutral" basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(a) Complementary products are costed on a normal commercial basis, using Australia Post's product costing system (see (5) above). This includes an appropriate allocation of staffing and building costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) All costs are met by Australia Post. Recipients are suppliers of services and goods under normal commercial arrangements and Post's own staff and licensees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8)(a) Australia Post's trading in complementary products is funded from the Corporation's working capital. That working capital is managed on a strictly commercial basis, and in this respect Australia Post enjoys no special advantage over its private sector competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Australia Post's borrowings are raised in the open market, at strictly commercial rates. In the last published accounts which relate to the year ended 30 June 1994, Australia Post's borrowings of $235 million had been raised through an unsecured floating rate note (FRN) facility  (term expiring in 1999). As an outcome of an open tender process the Commonwealth Bank was awarded a contract to manage and underwrite the FRN issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9)(a) Complementary products are retailed as part of the range of services available through Australia Post's national network of outlets. All of these activities are managed commercially, in accordance with existing legislation, and complementary products share the administrative back up services provided for the other retailing activities of Australia Post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Australia Post's product costing system (see (5) above) is used to measure the cost of products and processes based on the goods and services purchased. Those goods and services are purchased commercially in the market place, and all of the Corporation's products and services, including complementary products, are costed consistently on this basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) As indicated in the answer to question (3), this service is one of the non-reserved services which are traded by Australia Post in open competition with other producers. Australia Post does not propose to make public information which they could use to their commercial advantage. However, as also indicated in the answer to question (3), all services provided through the retail network and priced individually cover their direct and indirect costs and make a contribution to overheads and profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) Australia Post does not apply profits from activities in reserved services to subsidise activities in contestable market sectors, nor does it intend to do so in the future. As shown in the answer to question (3), Australia Post derives about half of its profit from competitive products and services sold in contestable markets. This is adequate to fund development of new commercial initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) The Government provides a number of different types of pensions, including, for example, age pension and service (age) pension, disability support pension and sole parent pension. The levels of pension and supplementary benefits vary according to the status of the pensioner (ie. whether single, married, or married but living apart due to illness or infirmity). The Department of Social Security releases a guide to Social Security payments on a quarterly basis. The Department of Veterans' Affairs also releases similar information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All recipients of taxable pensions face exactly the same income tax rates as other individual taxpayers, including a tax free threshold of $5,400. Recipients of taxable pensions also have access to the pensioner rebate at a level determined by their taxable income. These rebates are a means of providing assistance through the tax system to people who are in the most relative need. The pensioner rebate is available to people who receive either a full-rate or part-rate pension, ensuring that full-rate pensioners (including those who earn non-pension income not in excess of the income test free amount) do not pay tax, and that most part-rate pensioners have a reduced tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensions are generally reduced at the rate of 50 cents in the dollar for each dollar of non-pension income earned in excess of the pension income test free area. The pensioner tax rebate also shades out, at the rate of 12.5 cents in the dollar, for each dollar of taxable income in excess of the relevant rebate threshold (ie. full rate pension income plus the pension income test free area).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pensioner tax rebate has the effect of providing pensioners with a more progressive tax scale compared to other taxpayers. The Government justifies this approach on the grounds of social equity in that pensioners are one of the poorest groups in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government chose to assist age pensioners with a tax rebate rather than an increase in the tax free threshold because raising the tax threshold would also assist high income earners and those with substantial assets at a significant cost to revenue and encourage the practice of income splitting, which would also add to the cost to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pensioner rebate may be transferred between couples. That is, any unused rebate of a pensioner may be added to the rebate of the spouse where the spouse has, or would have, a tax liability.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the phasing out of the age pension and pension tax rebate, the disposable income of those in receipt of an age pension will be lower than that of retirees who do not receive the pension, except for those persons who fail to meet the age, residency or assets test requirements for the age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where applicable, pensioners and other low income earners, including many non-pensioner retirees, also have access to the $150 low income tax rebate. That rebate begins to shade out at a rate of 4 cents in the dollar, once taxable income exceeds $20,700, so that it cuts out at a taxable income of $24,450.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain amounts supplementary to the pension are tax exempt, ie. any part of a payment that represents: (a) rent assistance, (b) an increase in rate of pension calculated by reference to other persons, or (c) remote area allowance. Payments of pharmaceutical allowance and telephone allowance are also non-taxable, as are some bereavement payments. Such supplementary payments are tax exempt because the payments are meant to cover specific purposes (rather than being a primary source of income), and the Government intends that the full amounts be made available for such purposes. None of these amounts, however, are included in the calculation of the pensioner rebate or shade-out threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As noted above, pensioners and non-pensioner retirees face the same tax-free threshold of $5,400. Pensioners receive a pensioner rebate which operates to extinguish tax liability on the pension plus non-pension income up to a specified total amount. In July 1994 Treasury provided the honourable Senator with an estimate of the cost of extending the rebate for age pensioners to non-pensioner retirees. That is, the cost of extending the pensioner rebate to female non-pensioner taxpayers aged 60 years or over and male non-pensioner taxpayers aged 65 years or over, who have income below the level where the pensioner rebate shades out but who do not receive the age pension, was estimated to be in the order of $70 million for the 1993-94 income year. While the cost of such a measure has not been re-estimated, I understand the estimate would not have changed significantly since that time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) At 3 October 1995 there are 25 joint, select, references and legislation committees supported by the Department of the Senate, comprising 8 references committees, 8 legislation committees, 6 select committees and 3 joint statutory committees.

Over the financial year 1994-95 these committees, together with other select committees in operation during that year, received 157 references from the Senate, not including estimates and annual reports (Source: Department of the Senate Annual Report 1994-95, pp. 103-104).</PARA>

References and select committee inquiries cost considerably more than legislation and estimates inquiries, in both staff costs and administrative expenses. The Senate Committee Office Review of Resources, tabled in the Senate on 27 September 1995, estimated that a typical references committee inquiry would cost $15,000 in administrative expenses (advertising, postage, printing and photocopying, consultants, venue hire, staff travel, witness expenses), while a typical legislation inquiry would cost around $2,000. Including staff salaries, which is the largest component of Committee Office costs, and senators' travel allowance in association with committee meetings, the 157 inquiries undertaken during the 1994-95 financial year cost an average of $30,800 each.</PARA>
