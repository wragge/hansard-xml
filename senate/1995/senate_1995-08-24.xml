<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general revenue assistance to the States and Territories for the 1995-96 financial year, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers' Conference of 11 April 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The April 1995 Premiers' Conference was held in conjunction with the Council of Australian Governments meeting which agreed to a program for the implementation of the National Competition Policy and related reforms and to an associated set of financial arrangements. The central elements of the National Competition Policy were incorporated in the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 which received Royal Assent on 20 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The existing Act currently covers the provision of general revenue assistance for 1994-95 only, with interim arrangements for continuing payments to a maximum of six months. The Bill extends the provision of the existing Act for a further twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general revenue assistance for the States and the Territories to be appropriated by the Bill is estimated to be almost $15.7 billion, or around 12.7 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1995-96. Accordingly, these payments constitute a significant element of the Commonwealth Budget and, in combination with the Loan Council Allocations for borrowings by all levels of government agreed at the April 1995 Loan Council Meeting, have an important bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1995 Premiers' Conference reaffirmed the continuation of the real per capita guarantee for the indexation of financial assistance grants to the States and Territories in 1995-96. The real per capita guarantee was made to the States at the 1994 Premiers' Conference for the three year period to 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments held in conjunction with the 1995 Premiers' Conference the Commonwealth agreed to extend the guarantee to 1997-98 and thereafter on a rolling three year basis. The provision of the rolling three year real per capita guarantee reflected the Commonwealth's desire to foster cooperative Commonwealth-State relations which would, in turn, offer a sound basis for working together to progress microeconomic reform. The Commonwealth recognised that this would best be achieved through provision of a degree of certainty for the States about the level of funding they could expect from the Commonwealth over the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major part of the assistance provided under this Bill is the provision to each State and Territory of a share of the pool of financial assistance grants which is estimated to be around $14.9 billion in 1995-96. The 1995 Premiers' Conference agreed that the distribution of this assistance should be in accordance with the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on General Revenue Grant Relativities, 1995 Update</EMPHASIS>, and estimates of State and Territory populations as at 31 December 1995 as determined by the Australian Statistician.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill authorises the payment of special revenue assistance to the States in 1995-96 estimated at $437 million. Of this amount, $412 million relates to payments to New South Wales and Victoria under the guarantee arrangements associated with the Medicare Agreements. The Commonwealth will fund $58.9 million of these payments and the residual will be funded from the financial assistance grants pool. The remaining special revenue assistance relates to pool-funded special revenue assistance for the Territories. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will receive $15 million and $10 million respectively in order to ease their transition to State-like funding levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Capital Territory will also receive $49.1 million in the form of Commonwealth funded transitional allowances and special fiscal needs. This payment is outside the scope of this Bill and has been included in the Appropriation Bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995-96, the Government will provide an estimated $369 million in identified arterial road grants to the States and Territories. In accordance with the agreement reached at the 1995 Premiers' Conference, in each of 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98, one third of identified road grants will be cumulatively distributed on the basis of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's relativities which underlie the distribution of financial assistance grants. Thus in 1997-98, identified road grants will be fully distributed on the basis of the relativities underlying financial assistance grants. Until then, that part of identified road grants not distributed on the basis of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's relativities will continue to be distributed on the basis of the 1994-95 shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the State and Territory Governments and of the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA>We are rightly disgusted with child exploitation and slave labour conditions in other countries. We need to do something about these conditions in Australia. I pay tribute to the government's establishment of the tripartite working party under the chairmanship of former Attorney-General Mr Michael Duffy. That to some extent will look at what happens to children in our own backyard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must ensure that the exploitation of home workers, mainly women, migrants and, one suspects, also children, in conditions which we fought for decades to eliminate from Australia, does not continue. It has been claimed that  contract conditions between manufacturers, which include some of the most expensive brands, and outworkers are fair and reasonable. On the other hand, there are persistent reports of damage to health, injuries, long hours in poor conditions and pitifully low pay. All of this was documented in some detail in the report by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The hidden cost of fashion</EMPHASIS>. It is indeed time that we as a society got to the bottom of what is actually happening. It is essential that the industry is compelled to follow reasonable standards regarding minimum rates of pay for piece work, to ensure that award rates are not undercut, and that the safety and wellbeing of outworkers and their families are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context it is also relevant to examine the capacity of the industry to pay fair rates and to ensure that children are not employed under conditions which affect their school attendance, health and general wellbeing. Another matter which needs to be examined is the extent to which these practices are used to avoid tax and to circumvent social security provisions. It is also important to examine the extent to which our consideration of these conditions impacts on ILO conventions and our observance of those conventions in Australia. In my discussions with the other parties, I was advised by the coalition that they had some concerns about those two last points and, in a simplified set of terms of reference, those two items were omitted. However, I believe that they are essential to remain in the terms of reference, and I have therefore moved my motion accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the motion I added, yesterday, by amendment, a general clause which satisfies one of the concerns of the coalition, namely, that it might not be broad enough and, because it is fairly detailed, some matters might escape the consideration of the committee. So I have included a clause which says that any other matters which are relevant to the above terms of reference can be considered. I have also taken account, following discussions with Senator Ferguson as the Chairman of the Economics References Committee, of the load of that committee, and I have amended the reporting date to 30 January. I certainly did not think it was wise to have a reporting date which would clearly put it in danger of clashing with an election which most people now expect to take place in February or March next year. I have received indications of support for this motion from the government and from the WA Greens. I wish to put my appreciation on record. </PARA>

It has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> since that time. Since then it has been a subject of discussion this week between myself and Senator Spindler but, in fairness, let me say that it has been the history of these committees to at least discuss terms of reference such as these at committee meetings where every committee member can have some input.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took advice this morning, particularly from Senator Childs, who has been a long-serving member of that committee. Senator Childs explained to the committee&mdash;and he may say so himself directly&mdash;the change that has taken place in past years whereby terms of reference are passed on to the committee by the Senate, rather than committee members themselves generating certain terms of reference. So the workload on many committees has made it almost impossible for the committee to do its work properly with the participation of most members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all of the matters that have been raised by Senator Spindler and the concerns that he has expressed are concerns of every member of the community. Certainly, there was no disagreement at our committee meeting this morning about the concerns that Senator Spindler raised and whether or not they should be addressed by the committee at some future date. What concerns me is that, in discussion with Senator Spindler, I said it was impossible for us to handle these terms of reference this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee already has two terms of reference which have been ongoing. We had a telecommunications inquiry, which we are trying to complete and report on by the end of this parliamentary session. Another reference was referred to us by a member of the Democrats with regard to Eastlink and the problems proposed by that. We accepted that reference. We have not yet had any hearings. We are also trying to complete that reference by the end of the parliamentary session. We may not, but we are trying to complete it by the end of the parliamentary session. I said to Senator Spindler that it would be impossible for us to do anything with regard to a reference to outworkers in the garment industry prior to Christmas. Certainly, it would be something that we would have to do next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that an election is going to be held some time and that many senators on this side are on three or four committees, as are many government members because of their numbers. It is just not fair to ask a committee to handle terms of reference like these without proper discussion at the committee meeting. For that reason, amongst others, we will be opposing this motion, not because we oppose the concept and the terms of reference. I think it ought to be a matter of discussion for the committee. The terms of reference should be discussed by all members of that committee who will be a part of the deliberations. We do not want another reference thrown at the committee from this chamber by an individual senator, particularly in this case a senator who was a member of the committee and who has never attended the meetings and discussed the matter with other members who were present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we seem to have a habit of references being generated from this chamber by individual senators, often without consultation with the committee, sometimes just by consultation between either the chair of the committee or some individual members of the committee. We have situations where matters have been referred to committees by individuals who are sometimes members who then take no further part&mdash;or very little part&mdash;in the hearings or the deliberations of the committee once the matter has been referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I listened with interest to Senator Childs's contributions this morning because, when you have someone who has been a chairman for some 10 years, all members of the committee appreciate his experience and his point of view. There are certain procedures that should take place prior to a matter such as this being referred to the Senate&mdash;some consultation even. Maybe Senator Childs will expand on those reasons. I and other members of the committee agreed unanimously that those procedures ought to be followed before any final terms of reference were decided on or before the committee accepted those particular terms of reference which Senator Spindler wants to bring forward today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the view that committees must be allowed to manage their own programs. I think everybody would agree that the pressure of committee work is becoming greater and greater and that the pressures on individual senators as members of those committees is becoming greater. It is important that each individual committee is allowed to manage its program so that it does not have a backlog which impinges on the work of the secretariat. It makes their job much harder because they then have several references, with submissions coming in from several areas at the one time. I do not believe that the pressure we are putting on the secretariat and the secretaries servicing these committees is fair if we allow references to come willy-nilly before committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: I have no objection to the principles of this reference. If we have some discussion at committee level and if we go through the sorts of procedures that Senator Childs outlined to our committee this morning, I am quite sure at the end of the day that we can come up with a reference which covers the concerns of Senator Spindler but certainly which has a realistic reporting date and which may include other matters which Senator Spindler has not included in his original terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I am going to oppose this motion of Senator Spindler's, purely because I do not believe that those procedures have been followed to the fullest. I do not believe it is a realistic timing that has been put on the reporting date and also I think there are other matters that need to be discussed before we finalise any terms of reference. So, Senator Spindler, I appreciate your concerns in that area, as I indicated to you when you first raised this matter. There are some concerns that I certainly agree with. I think there is possibly a need for the committee to have a look at a reference in this area. But this is not the time for this motion to go through without further discussion. It would be premature to pass this motion today. </PARA>

It is on the issue of process that I want to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler has not, at any stage, discussed this matter with me; and we are both members of the committee. This is a development that has actually been occurring in recent times in this chamber. People move motions in the Senate as a whole, with a date of return, and, often, the committee has no say in the date of return. The difficulties that the committee has in working through its references are not considered before the senator moves the issue in the chamber itself. Also, the actual detail of the motion should be a result of collective discussion. This motion is not. For that reason, it is wrong to put it up in this chamber today and expect it to be carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has started the discussion this morning of what would be an appropriate term of reference. There is no disagreement with the principles outlined by Senator Spindler. As far as I am concerned, and not just in this case&mdash;but this is the straw that has broken the back&mdash;senators, because of their political agenda, make the move in the Senate and do not allow a committee to consider its priorities, workload and the agenda it wants to follow over time. If you want to threaten the references committees of the Senate completely, you will not allow committees to have strategic planning of the agenda they want to follow. When every committee has difficulty in getting people to attend meetings&mdash;I think most people are, on average, members of six committees&mdash;you will find you will not have the commitment because people have not had the initial involvement and agreement that they want to follow that particular reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all those reasons I oppose the motion being moved. I think if we now start the process of appropriately consulting all members of the committee and anybody else, then within another week or so we will be able to finalise a term of reference on this matter that is acceptable to everybody. I ask the Senate to reject on this occasion the proposal put forward by Senator Spindler. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on this matter. There are some important issues that have been brought up so far in this debate. The committees of the Senate are supposed to be the servants of the Senate and the democratic process. Anybody who believes that a reference is important must take full cognisance of the workload of the committee which they choose, the competence of the committee to deal with the issues, the nature of the inquiry and the length of the inquiry. Ideally, the wording should be run by the committee before the reference is put to the Senate.

But there is a democratic process. Every senator was elected to this chamber and has an equal democratic right. If a motion is passed, fine. There can possibly be some changes in wording; it is better, obviously. In this case what results is that the committee gets together and decides on wording. Maybe they will decide on a reference that they would not be willing to do by themselves. Every now and then it is necessary to bring a debate to a point so that kind of discussion occurs in that committee. Maybe the committee would never have had that discussion if this motion were not put.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore there has to be give and take.

I know some members of the Senate have found it more convenient to use it as some kind of political platform for an offensive polemic, using some form of inverse racism. That does not seem a very useful approach to a problem which is serious and which should extend far beyond the sorts of political exchanges which, I must say, have not graced this chamber and which, I believe, have damaged the status of the chamber and the reputations of the people involved in that kind of absurd political point scoring.</PARA></TALK.START>

Consider the nature of the legislation&mdash;in fact, the words of the title of the bill, Racial Hatred Bill. That word `hatred' is not conciliatory. It is a word aimed at confrontation.

Senator Short's speech dramatised the fact that many people in ethnic communities in Australia feel more threatened by this bill than protected by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I am of the strong view that, where you have this kind of evident conflict and evident disagreement, it is absurd for the government to press on with legislation which, it knows, is causing division within the society and which is not satisfactory according to plentiful evidence presented to this chamber, by Senator Short in particular, revealing divisions within the ethnic communities themselves, within those communities that this bill is allegedly protecting. </PARA>

There is a need to do something. In fact, many elements of legislation provide penalties for some of the racist things that are dealt with in this bill. Some of the penalties in this bill are lower, smaller and less significant than the penalties that already exist for some actions which are not based on racism but which are a manifestation of racist activity, particularly causing property and other damage. </PARA>

The fire-bomb attacks on a number of Perth Asian restaurants were aimed not at the owners of particular businesses but at intimidating the entire Asian community. A swastika and a threatening slogan on the wall of a synagogue is not equivalent to defacing private or public property, as the intended victims of intimidation are Jewish people as a group. It is accepted that the murder of a police officer is a crime on a different level to that of murder as it is a crime against society and it is the ECAJ's firm belief that racially motivated crimes are also crimes against good order and challenge the basis of our society.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that. There is a case for legislation of this kind dealing with offences which are more than simply offences against individuals, in particular victims, which are aimed at terrorising members of those communities. There is no doubt that happens. We have to determine whether the risk of this kind of activity not being punishable, and the risk that it poses to our society, is so great that it merits a serious threat to individual freedom that this legislation imposes. In my view&mdash;and it is an on-balance view&mdash;this threat that concerns the Executive Council of Australian Jewry goes nowhere near overwhelmingly addressing the central feature of our society, which is individual freedom. The submission goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anti-Jewish racism (anti-semitism) in Australia manifests itself through acts of violence against persons and property, harassment of individuals and groups of Jewish Australians, intimidation and threats directed against individuals, organisations and institutions within the Jewish community.</PARA>
<PARA>The Jewish community knows only too well how it has to cope with the problem. I remind the Jewish community that, in authoritarian countries where freedom is limited, the need to cope with this sort of problem would be far greater than is the case in this country. The ECAJ contends that there is abundant evidence to demonstrate that this protection against serious attempts to undermine tolerance by stirring up hatred between groups is required. The submission goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although many acts which would constitute racial incitement and racial vilification might also be covered by existing public order laws, it is important to make clear that the gravamen of racial hatred offence is the racist content of it and not simply the fact that abusive or offensive words are used. The ECAJ considers it important that there be a clear unequivocal statement on the statute book that the Australian community disapproves of racial incitement and racial hatred.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that there is a need for it to be somewhere in the statute book. Why does it have to be there at the risk of Australians' freedom of expression and at the risk of putting Australians in gaol for what they think and what they say? My major concern is that the determination of an offence under this law is going to be subjective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important consideration is whether it is `reasonably likely'. Who is going to determine whether it is reasonably likely? There are no stated criteria. You are going to be found guilty and face a gaol sentence if somebody thinks that what you did may have been reasonably likely to create some kind of violence. There is a different onus of proof in terms of a conspiracy to create violence. It is illegal to conspire to do something illegal. I find it unacceptable that subjective criteria and not objective criteria would be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have some concerns that equality before the law is being challenged in this matter. We should all be equal before the law, particularly those people being charged with an offence. Are victims to be treated differently before the law? Is the law going to treat people differently because, say, victim A is different from victim B? I am a first generation Australian. If I am subject to some kind of attack, will the nature of the attack on me be different from the nature of the attack on, say, my wife who is, I think, a sixth generation Australian?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to create divisions in a society, not resolve them. You are making people different because of the way they are to be dealt with in this kind of legislation. You are not uniting the society; you are aggravating and underlining the differences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of notable speeches from speakers on the Racial Hatred Bill. I do not believe I can comment any better on the failings of this bill and its intent than my colleagues Senator Jim Short and Senator Bill O'Chee. Senator O'Chee, an Australian of mixed race parents, spoke passionately about tolerance in Australia, and I would suspect that during his life he has had a far better opportunity to assess the tolerance of Australians than I.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Racism is not something that legislation alone can prevent, just as drug addiction cannot be eradicated by harsher gaol penalties. Racism is borne out of ignorance and fear and overcome only by education. As Senator O'Chee said, you must not tell people what they must think and you cannot tell people what they must feel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks and months we have celebrated VE Day and VP Day. Many Australians fought against the Germans and the Japanese. I suspect that many sentiments expressed during reunions this year would indeed fall foul of this bill's ideals. Surely we have come to a ridiculous state of political correctness if returned soldiers cannot have some understandably passionate sentiments against a country that was once our enemy. That is not to suggest the veteran per se is a bigot or a racist; that is not to suggest that, given an opportunity, he would commit any crime against a citizen of either Japan or Germany. But it is perfectly understandable, and surely totally acceptable, for old soldiers to have particular sentiments. As Senator O'Chee says, you cannot legislate for what people feel, and neither should you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia in the 1960s, attitudes against the Aboriginal community were appalling but they were allowed to flourish because laws were in place that allowed them to. In the intervening years, legislation has been put in place that prevents publicans from refusing service to non-whites; legislation is in place that prevents employers from discriminating against Asians, Catholics or the disabled. But legislation cannot prevent people from having feelings of resentment against any group for whatever reason, and that is the flaw of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old adage that you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink is appropriate here. The purpose of the legislation is to prohibit conduct including threats to cause physical harm to a person or group; threats to destroy or damage property; and incitement of racial hatred and acts likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or group on the basis of race, colour or ethnic origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation has been condemned not just by the coalition but outside this place as well because it is flawed, inappropriate and ineffective. The legislation is inappropriate because it assumes that Australia is a racist country, and I do not really believe that to be the case. We are rapidly developing into one of the most multicultural societies in the world. It is over 30 years since the white Australia policy was abolished. It is over 40 years since Polish, Greek and Italian migrants were first welcomed to Australia. It is over 20 years since Vietnamese and other South-East Asian migrants first came to Australia to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been at the forefront of that migration, so our opposition to this legislation does not stem from any lack of understanding. As previous speakers have said, we believe that only by education, not coercive legislation, can racism be overcome. The government naively believes that forcing people through the threat of criminal and civil sanctions is the appropriate course to take. That approach has not worked in the United States&mdash;it is almost a weekly occurrence to see some form of racial attack in the US&mdash;and it has not worked in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill intends to amend the Crimes Act to allow for three criminal offences and it is these sanctions that are particularly flawed. As the Parliamentary <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tests of intention have caused some difficulty in countries such as the United Kingdom. One problem is that it often depends upon the people to whom the act is communicated (i.e. the audience of a speech or the readers of racist material). If the people at whom the act is directed are unlikely to be incited to hatred (such as members of Parliament and other public officials), or if the intention of the act is to get them to support a change in policy, then no matter how offensive the words, an offence will not have been committed.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill also proposes to amend the Racial Discrimination Act by inserting another section: prohibition of offensive behaviour based on racial hatred. This section is so subjective as to be a legal minefield. How does one define `insult', `offend' and `humiliate'? What is insulting to one may be humorous to another. I do not believe that people have really thought that through well enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To call someone `a silly old bugger', depending on the circumstances, might be an affectionate, familiar description or an offence. Some people find no offence in being called a `pom'; others may take offence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with this legislation, and with people trying to outlaw offensive behaviour, is that it tends to increase our intolerance and has the potential to have quite the opposite effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we find ourselves debating the Racial Hatred Bill 1994, a bill which potentially pits race against race in court battles which will leave various communities divided. I ask: for what? The government's bill goes much further than is necessary, let alone appropriate, to combat racial harassment. It goes much further than is needed to send a message to the community that that type of conduct is unacceptable because I think that message is already understood in Australia in 1995. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a moment let me delve into the proposed section 60 of this bill. This section is a fundamental denial of the right of free speech and on that ground alone the bill should be opposed. Section 60 establishes a new class of offence which impacts upon expressions of opinion rather than expressions of violent intent. It is not that those people who are victims of racial harassment or racial vilification are helpless, because they do not feel that they are. It is always a question of balance as to whether they have some remedy that is not presently available to them, such as that which is now being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not support a criminal sanction for expressing a view and encouraging others to adopt it when you are not inciting people to damage property or persons. To create an offence of inciting racial hatred, without linking that incitement to damage to people or property, makes it an offence to try and get other people to agree with your point of view, however offensive that may or may not be. That means an offence is committed even if there is no urging of the other people to act in a violent way on that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: why should a person be put in gaol for encouraging others to adopt a view, however racially prejudiced that view may be? I think the famous Voltaire quote is appropriate when we talk about this legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.</PARA>
<PARA>Conversely, if a person incites others to damage property or persons, then of course criminal sanctions are called for and are available at common law and perhaps under some state law. Section 60 is the offensive provision and one that I could never support in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill before the Senate today also allows for civil action to be taken for hurt feelings and injured sensibilities. Surely, the government is not trying to tell us that it is government's role to make behaviour that is simply socially unacceptable unlawful, because this issue must always be handled by education. It is education, not the law, that is essential for changing such behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot legislate to make people think in a certain way, however unfortunate and politicly incorrect that may be. It is worth saying that neither side of politics can claim the high moral ground on this issue. Both sides of politics want a highly developed multicultural and tolerant society. But to take the view that you can access civil action to make people think in an appropriate way or have a certain opinion of you at best drives views underground where they are likely to do more damage. If people are allowed to express their bigoted views through the media or publicly, they are then more open to public accountability and ridicule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will see otherwise law-abiding citizens dragged before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The other aspect of this argument is how will courts interpret such subjective terms as `insult' and `offend', as Senator Baume quite clearly pointed out. Experience in other jurisdictions demonstrates how it becomes an enormous dilemma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the constitutional questions arising from this legislation. Some prosecutions and civil actions taken under the proposed legislation are likely to breach the High Court's implied constitutional right of freedom of political speech. Some statements that the bill makes criminal or unlawful will occur in the field of political discussion. Laws prohibiting such discussion will be unconstitutional unless the government can show a counterbalancing public interest. Democracy is under threat whenever we consider a bill that restricts what people say, even where the vast majority of people believe the remarks themselves are offensive. Criminal sanction against somebody who incites violence against persons or property for any reason is already in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You arguably cannot do it at common law. You cannot do it under existing criminal law, whether it be the Crimes Act in New South Wales or the Summary Offences Act. In a liberal democracy it is not wise to proscribe behaviour unless it is absolutely necessary. That applies whether you are dealing with a bill of rights, anti-discrimination legislation generally, whistleblower legislation or sexual privacy legislation. Where change is not necessary, I think the old cliche is appropriate&mdash;it is necessary not to change. To identify forms of behaviour that are appropriate or acceptable immediately gives an excuse for other near acceptable behaviour not covered by the particular new legislation to be accessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some real cynicism, I believe, in this particular piece of legislation, apart from the title itself&mdash;`racial hatred'&mdash;where hatred is a thought and not necessarily an action. We have a diverse group of people who oppose the bill. They have been mentioned before&mdash;they range from Archbishop Hollingworth to Phillip Adams and Father Frank Brennan. There has been a very wide range of community opposition to this bill, and I think the government should have taken more note of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be criticism of us for delaying the passage of this bill. I reject that. It is not as if this legislation has been suddenly necessary. It has been talked about by the government for years&mdash;not weeks, not months, but years. It has taken them a long time to get round to it. I think this sort of political agenda&mdash;apart from political correctness&mdash;of the government has been to try to distract from the more important issues that are pressing this nation. </PARA>

Even Mr Isi Leibler, representing the Ethnic Coalition, has been quoted as saying that our exposure bill does little more than reiterate existing criminal law. If his legal view is correct, so what?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Racial Hatred Bill, which is a very disturbing bill in many aspects. In the 17th century we had the French satirist Voltaire, who is quoted as saying, `I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.' Then we had in the 1800s the liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill, who wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>In consideration of this Racial Hatred Bill in the 20th century I think these quotes are just as apt if we take the bill in the context of freedom of speech. That is the area which concerns me immensely today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were to sum up the views of my constituents at the moment, I would say that they are first and foremost concerned that they will be prosecuted in some way for thinking thoughts about multiculturalism or immigration which may be construed by somebody else under this legislation as racially vilifying. That is the concern&mdash;that we are going to have the thought police interpreting everything that somebody else is saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also feel that their right to comment on the social structure of their own country will be effectively abolished under this legislation, and I can tell you they are not particularly happy about that prospect. They have a right to speak their mind and they wish to exercise that. They do not wish to exercise a position of racial vilification or hatred; they just want to speak their mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these people recognise racism and are totally opposed to it, particularly when it culminates, in extreme cases, in threats against person and property. As a Western Australian, I can only say that the recent fire bombing of the French Consul building in Perth&mdash;which, incidentally, is just around the corner from my office&mdash;was something that was considered absolutely outrageous by every person to whom I spoke and who commented on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That behaviour is not tolerated. People certainly do not tolerate the firebombing of Chinese restaurants, the spraying of racist slogans on walls, or the posting of seditious bills in bus shelters. They simply do not go along with that, and that is the whole issue. It is not a case of trying to lock up people because they think something or they might say something. The fact of the matter is that they are not racists at heart; they simply want to have the freedom to express an opinion. They have an inherent understanding of what is right and what is wrong. They certainly view those types of firebombings, bill-posting episodes and activities as particularly antisocial and, I might say, totally unAustralian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like most people, Australians are prepared to give all people a fair go regardless of their race, colour, ethnicity or nationality. But, likewise, the coalition is totally opposed to racism. It has a proud record of commitment to the elimination of racism and, to suggest otherwise, as this government continues to do, is absolutely and utterly absurd. They choose to forget, in their rewriting of history, our attitude to multiculturalism and our attitude to the way in which we tolerate a very diverse nation. We accept and enjoy, I might add, a very diverse nation. They choose to forget that it was, after all, the coalition which abolished the White Australia policy&mdash;a decision which led to the migration of a wide range of people from all over the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to multicultural functions where I have actually heard Labor politicians saying that they were the ones who got rid of the White Australia policy. Of course, we have become used to the lies of the Labor Party to get re-elected. We have become used to the untruths as well. I detect your frown, Mr Acting Deputy President, at the use of the word I used to describe their behaviour. Nonetheless, I think the way in which the Labor Party continues to rewrite history on some of these issues is very sad because it was, after all, the coalition that established the Office of Multicultural Affairs. It was, after all, the coalition that established SBS Television and a wide range of multicultural settlement services which form the foundation of today's multicultural policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to listen to the talk of this mob today, and in years gone by, you would consider that we not only opposed the introduction of all of those measures but that in fact it was the Labor Party who did the introducing. That is wrong. Therefore to suggest that we are in any way a racially-based party is just absurd, and offensive in the extreme. Clearly, the coalition is not racist, and I think I have been able to demonstrate that, in the last few sentences particularly, and I will continue over the months and years to come to demonstrate our attitude to the type of Australia that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our position that the focal point of the Racial Hatred Bill should be the prohibition of racially-based threats of physical harm to property or person. The stronger penalties that have been proposed by the coalition reflect the fact that racially-motivated threats of violence have absolutely no place in Australia, and neither do the people who make such threats and carry them out. However, the coalition's position upholds the value of freedom of speech&mdash;one of the most sacred cows of our democracy and, of course, of our constitution. No political party should be seen to be throwing the baby out with the bathwater and just simply saying that our constitution matters no longer or that we can restrict freedom of speech and get away with it. We cannot, and that is not what the people of Australia want. They want to retain their freedom of speech, but not from racial motivation. But that position, of course, is to be contrasted with the government's legislation which, undoubtedly, compromises freedom of speech through its restrictive limitations on incitement to racial hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what most people out there in the community are worried about. They, like the coalition, do not want to see people facing criminal sanctions every time they say or think something which may be interpreted by somebody else as incitement to racial hatred. We will have consistent claims by every Tom, Dick and Harry that this is racial incitement. It was absurd to suggest that the firebombing of the French consuls building in Perth would not have happened had this bill been in place. There were criminal penalties to be imposed against the initiators of that attack, and they are currently going through the judiciary system. What is wrong with the current system which will see those people brought to justice? You do not need this bill to have those people brought to justice. There is no word from anyone that will justify this bill in relation to those particular people and their vicious, horrible, despicable actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my opening statement, just because we disagree with what someone says does not mean that they do not have a right to say it. Certainly, they should not be sent to gaol by the thought police for comments which intend no harm to other races. There is a clear difference between the expression of an opinion and a blatant threat of physical harm to a person or property. It is equally disturbing that the government's bill allows civil remedies to be sought through applications to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This would apply in the case of comments being made which are insulting or which offend. Quite frankly, the impact of all of that is absolutely and utterly mind-boggling. The potential for people to be dragged before the commission just because they have referred to someone as a Yank or as a Pom is quite real under the present legislation. That takes us from the sublime to the ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, it will probably nip Aussie humour right in the bud. A lot of sport commentators, for example, would have their vocabulary seriously curtailed. It is true that legislation of this type may play an important role in deterring many people who are already actively engaged in organised racially motivated criminal offences, although many of them are probably clever enough to sidestep these laws. This is a classic case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and it has gone far beyond that which is necessary. It is for those reasons that I have made these comments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is, however, a matter of regret to us that the government has denied the parliament the opportunity&mdash;it seems to us&mdash;to make an historic and bipartisan declaration about racial hatred and vilification in this country. It is a great pity because there is no doubt that eliminating racism is a cause that enjoys universal support in this place. Also, it would seem that there is widespread support among senators and members for the idea that it is appropriate for the federal parliament to have on its statute books laws which target the worst forms of racial vilification.

As a result, it produced a bill that the coalition finds it cannot support, for reasons that I will refer to shortly and that have been mentioned by previous speakers.

They, however, approach this bill in a very different way&mdash;a very political way. Such a process would have at least given us a chance at trying to develop a bill that could have had bipartisan support on what is undeniably an important issue for all Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians should be able to live their lives without fear for their personal wellbeing that extreme forms of racial hatred, vilification and intolerance necessarily produce.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eliminating racial hatred can be genuinely achieved only if people of their own free will recognise that such attitudes are unjustifiable. Changing those attitudes must be the first priority of government. It must also be recognised that it has not been&mdash;and will not always be&mdash;possible to, by force of logic alone, change the attitudes of proponents of racist views. For that reason, those who suffer from the worst manifestations of racism should have recourse to and the protection of the law. In addition to providing that protection, I also believe that properly drafted racial vilification laws can provide the basis for public education towards eliminating racism. The mere existence of such law sends a message to the community about the type of behaviour that is unacceptable within our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that there are many in our community who, with absolute sincerity and good faith, nevertheless argue against the principle of racial hatred or racial vilification laws.

Concern about free speech is interlinked with a belief that such laws achieve little in changing people's behaviour and that in a society which prides itself on the success of multiculturalism they are an over-reaction to what is not a great problem&mdash;to quote a former Labor senator, John Button, `a legislative steamroller to crack a few nuts'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criminal law is a very blunt instrument for reshaping the hearts of racists and clearing the air of racist sentiment. This proposed interference with civil liberties would do nothing to enhance . . . human rights. At this time, in this part of the world thought police armed with criminal sanctions are not the answer.</PARA>
<PARA>To my mind, the proponents of racial vilification legislation must answer three fundamental questions most frequently raised by the critics. Are race hatred laws an over-reaction to the needs of modern Australian society? Are such laws actually effective? Do they represent an intolerable threat to free speech? I want to touch briefly on these three issues. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian society is certainly one of the most racially tolerant societies in the world. We are spared the type of racial conflict and strife that we so frequently see encountered in other parts of the world. In part that has been the result of the policies of multiculturalism that I mentioned, which have been embraced by governments, both coalition and Labor, during the last two decades. More fundamentally it reflects the basic decency, tolerance and humanity of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless there is present within our society a small minority of people who propound racist views of the worst kind, those who do undeniably promote and seek to incite racial hatred and vilification. Dr Nguyen Trieu Dan, a Vietnamese community leader, wrote some little time ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of a Melbourne University study of year 11 and 12 students in Dandenong. Of 100 Vietnamese refugees students who took part in that survey, 69 claimed to have experienced racism in their school environment, 59 per cent in the streets and 14 per cent claim to have suffered either physical threats or actual injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other reports, including the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry into racist violence, have documented specific cases of race related violence. There can be no doubt that racial vilification and violence do occur in Australia. The fact that racial vilification is comparatively less prevalent in Australia than in virtually any other country is, I believe, sound justification for arguing against these types of laws. We have an obligation to defend the rights of and provide legal protection to every individual, be it one person or 1,000. The fact that a problem exists, no matter what the scale, is in my mind justification enough for legislative action. So it seems to me that the principle of such legislation is not an over-reaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question I posed is whether the type of legislation we are considering today can actually be effective. I have already stated that I think there is an educative role played by the very existence of such legislation, but fundamentally this legislation on its own cannot change beliefs. That is something I think even the most ardent supporters of racial hatred laws can see. What such laws can do is influence and contribute towards a change in behaviour. What they also do is offer some protection to the victims of the racial vilification and violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales has introduced and implemented such laws. South Australia under a Liberal government, New South Wales under a coalition government and South Australia under a Liberal government are also about to introduce such laws at a state level. So as to the issue of whether they can be effective, whilst one would not want to overstate the outcome, there is no doubt that laws do contribute to modifying behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue of this type that I mention is the question of the infringement of free speech and whether it can be justified. That, of course, is the area in which the critics are at their strongest. Racial vilification or hatred legislation certainly does represent some type of restriction upon free speech. There are some within our society who would argue that free speech is one of those paramount rights that should never be infringed. Certainly that has been the tenor of a few of those arguing against this type of legislation. Free speech, I agree, is a fundamental right, but it is not and, I would suggest, never has been, an unfettered right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already limit free speech when it is considered necessary to maintain other individual rights and the general order of society. I, of course, refer to laws in such areas as defamation, pornography, consumer protection and copyright. In this instance we are confronted with what one commentator has described as `the delicate contest'&mdash;the contest between the right to free speech and the right of Australian citizens to lead their lives without fear from racially inspired vilification and violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that it is possible to balance the competing interests, firstly, by ensuring that racial vilification laws deal with only the most serious manifestations of racism and, secondly, by ensuring that any legislation contains appropriate exemptions to protect debate, commentary and the promotion of ideas and beliefs within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me, it is difficult to find a sound basis for those that argue that principles associated with freedom of speech should take precedence over other rights and freedoms when we are dealing with threats of violence and damage to property and what is in effect interference with the ability of individuals to conduct their lives in a normal fashion free from persecution and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now had racial vilification laws operating in New South Wales for six years. I do not think anyone seriously argues that the right of free speech in New South Wales has been detrimentally affected by such laws. The New South Wales parliament, as I said, led then by a coalition government, has demonstrated that resolving that delicate contest is not beyond the skills of legislators and parliamentary draftsmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, however, it is a fine balance. That is why, perhaps more than usual, the precise form of legislation dealing with racial vilification is so absolutely important. If the balance is tipped too far in favour of restricting speech and the promulgation of written or artistic material, then my strong view is that the legislation should be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is principally because we believe that the government has failed to achieve an appropriate balance in the drafting of these measures that we have taken the decision that we must oppose them. In our view, this bill unduly restricts the rights of free speech that I have been referring to. It goes well beyond the legislative measures taken by various state parliaments, including New South Wales, despite the government's claim that state acts were to be a model upon which it would base its own bill. It goes beyond the recommendations of the various reports that the government has claimed were a significant motivating factor in its decision to introduce legislation in this area. It does so in relation to both the criminal and the civil offences that it seeks to create, but particularly in relation to the criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us creates three new criminal offences, two in relation to threatening a person or a group of people or their property because of their race, colour, national or ethnic origin; and a third, which is our area of great concern, that creates a criminal offence in terms that it proposes that intentional public acts that are reasonably likely to incite racial hatred&mdash;not personal injury or injury to property&mdash;against another person will be prohibited with a penalty of up to one year's imprisonment. This clause goes well beyond the criminal offence created under the New South Wales legislation, which, as I said, the government has claimed to be its model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the New South Wales legislation, it is an offence to publicly incite hatred towards, serious contempt for or severe ridicule of a person or group of persons on the ground of race, but by means which include threatening or inciting others to threaten physical harm or damage to property. That qualification is not included within the third offence that this government is seeking to establish in its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, therefore, and in the view of the coalition, the government's proposal tips the scale intolerably against the principles of free speech. It creates an offence that will be difficult for the courts to determine. It provides no exemptions for fair and accurate reporting. Perhaps most fundamentally, it creates an offence for advocating a particular belief as distinct from particular forms of behaviour and action, which is the primary test of the New South Wales legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that the minister referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission report into multiculturalism and the law and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in his second reading speech to justify the government's position. In many respects, he did so in a way that was disingenuous. A casual perusal of his speech would lead one to the view that the bill met the recommendations of those reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he had been truly frank, he might have acknowledged the fact that, whilst those reports recommended an extension of the law to provide protection against extreme racism, both specifically opposed criminal sanction. The ALRC regarded criminal sanctions as too great an infringement of civil liberties. The minister also made mention of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report on racist violence. Whilst that report supported some criminal sanctions, it too was concerned about criminal laws dealing with the `incitement of racial hostility' and recommended against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am equally concerned about the effects of the proposed civil offences in the bill. Again, this bill departs dramatically from the New South Wales model. In the form that it is in before us, it would become unlawful for a person to do an act in public that is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or group of people if that act is done because of the race of the offended person or persons. Again, I argue that that form of words presents an unacceptable threat to civil liberties in Australia. The New South Wales legislation provides a far more rigorous test, referring to inciting `hatred towards, serious contempt for or severe ridicule of a person or group of persons on the ground of race'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. While it supported civil actions, it did quite clearly recommend against the form of words that this government has chosen to include within this bill. Irene Moss in that report specifically argued that the threshold for prohibited conduct must be higher than `expressions of mere ill will' or conduct that results in `hurt feelings or injured sensitivities'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern about the way in which this bill has been drafted primarily relates to its impact on civil liberties. It quite simply goes too far. In seeking to address an evil, it introduces the risk of creating another evil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other issues of lesser concern that I have with the bill. It does not clearly define the term `race' so as to include ethno-religious groupings such as Muslims or Jews. It does not clearly define the word `public'. An example is whether a closed meeting or an organisation or private property would constitute a public act. I am concerned that, despite the minister's assurances, it does not clearly delineate responsibilities between the Commonwealth and those state jurisdictions with similar laws. I said at the outset that I am disappointed the government has introduced this bill in a form that we find unacceptable. If it had been in an acceptable form&mdash;a form that could have been negotiated&mdash;I would have been pleased to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope if the Senate successfully defeats this bill that it might be possible for the parliament to consider a more appropriate bill at a future date. Certainly it is our hope that the exposure draft of an alternative bill prepared by Senator Vanstone on behalf of the coalition, which is currently being considered within the community, may form the basis for such an opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed Racial Hatred Bill aims to deter racial vilification in our community. It is meant to signify the absolute unacceptability of intimidation on the grounds of a person's race or ethnicity. Nobody in the Australian community would not believe that that is a worthwhile aim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was originally proposed by the Keating government in 1992. It is finally before federal parliament to placate those parts of the constituency who wanted it then but who had to wait because of a then forthcoming election. The proposal has been welcomed by many who have suffered racial vilification. However, the issue is complex and there is no consensus in the community about the actual form that this legislation has taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have serious misgivings about this legislation. Let's look first at the form that the government has chosen to apply to the worthwhile aim of deterring racial vilification in our community. The bill proposes in its first section three new crimes under the federal Crimes Act: firstly, the threat to harm a person on the basis of racial, national or ethnic origin, with a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment; secondly, the threat to damage a person's property on the same basis, with a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment; and, thirdly, incitement to racial hatred in a public place, with a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment. Various specific concerns about the creation of those criminal offences have been dealt with at the committee level and are also worth flagging. I will be flagging them further in the committee stage of this bill's debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that, like myself, all honourable senators have been contacted by many members of the community. On the one hand, my office mailbag and phone lines have made me aware of the deep desire within what we would call the ethnic communities that this bill be passed without delay because of their own experience of racial hatred and their hope that this legislation would put an end to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, there has been an enormous amount of mail from people who did not identify themselves as belonging to the ethnic community, calling for this bill to be rejected because of fears that it would curtail freedom of speech or would make people subject to draconian new government powers. I have grave doubts that the hopes and aspirations mentioned by the former group will be carried out through this particular legislation. I have sympathy with those who express concern, for different motivations sometimes from my own, but who nevertheless raise very valid objections to the form that this legislation has taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, let us be clear that the bill makes it a crime to threaten violence or damage. The harm itself is already an offence under existing state laws. Not only do we have racial vilification laws as part of the criminal codes of New South Wales and Western Australia, all states in Australia have laws that look at the threatening of violence or damage whether it has a racial motivation or not. So we need to look here at the fact that the federal bill deals purely with threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this legislation is passed it will create a crime of words. This will take the legislation across a certain threshold into the realm of thought police&mdash;the most commonly voiced concern in the community and one which I share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bill only applies to threats made by private individuals in a public place. Institutions, political parties and incorporated bodies will not be affected, and the definition of a `private place' has been kept extremely liberal to protect the freedom of speech implied in Australia's constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My major concern lies elsewhere. I do not believe that we will become a less racist, more tolerant society by passing a law that imitates exactly the type of intolerance that we are trying to readdress&mdash;that is, intolerance of people expressing racial sentiments. We would be guilty of doing just what we are accusing racists of doing&mdash;singling out groups of people by labelling them unacceptable. It is a them and us adversarial way of thinking that underlies this bill. It is the same them and us attitude that underlies racism within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are three phases on the road to overcoming oppression. The first is that people who have been oppressed will often, and understandably on their release from that condition, go straight for the power that the oppressor represented. Identification with the oppressor is a natural first response. I believe that that is the natural first response of people who have experienced the humiliation, offence and insult of racism directed at their person. The comments I make in relation to this bill should in no way undercut the seriousness of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is copying the oppressor. What we need instead is a more positive way forward. Nelson Mandela is an outstanding example of the third phase of overcoming oppression. By not using against whites the same sort of power that was used against blacks he has reached a far more powerful model, that of working together in a community in which all belong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that someone like I may have less credibility in this area than someone who has suffered oppression and racial vilification, but I think my belief is similar to that of many of the victims of racism and racial vilification who have come to the realisation that they do not want to identify with the oppression which they have suffered. To say that people who are racist are criminals is to distance ourselves from the racist streak that is in all of us. It separates people rather than produces a positive sense of belonging in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By passing this bill we would be promoting the very attitude that we want to oppose&mdash;that is, of some people being superior and others inferior&mdash;rather than promoting the idea that we are all human beings who can work together. My response to the Racial Hatred Bill comes from wanting that same powerful stand of resisting all violence to all people, even against racists, as a way of promoting racial tolerance and harmony in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that to talk about violence and to differentiate different degrees of violence according to motivation is to set a false hierarchy. To say that racist violence is somehow worse than sexist violence or ageist violence is missing the point of what this bill is essentially aiming to achieve, which is harmony and tolerance. To actually make a hierarchy and not insist that all violence is unacceptable and all threats to damage people's property and all threats to hurt human beings are unacceptable in our community is the valid message. To say that one is worse than the other would create a false dichotomy&mdash;one that may well haunt us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people say the bill would be a signal to would-be perpetrators. Let us ask ourselves what kind of signal we are sending. I believe it is one of threat. The bill's intention is not to imprison those who use words to threaten, but to tell them to shut up. You do not even have to enforce these laws in order for a coercive message to be sent. In fact, that is why some support the bill. It sends what they believe is a strong deterrent message; a message that people who are against racism also have teeth. But the government's action in this area falls into the same category as the action taken by a lot of governments, which is to take the legislative path and promote criminal sanctions as the easy way to address the complex and difficult problems that exist within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This smacks very much of the easy retort when journalists revealed misdemeanours which the Australian federal government had been involved with in relation to the bugging of one of our consulates. They were threatened with being gaoled for revealing that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more recently, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) had a quick knee-jerk reaction, presumably to placate the feelings of Indonesia, that anybody who burns a flag should be made a criminal and receive a criminal penalty. It does not matter that the people of East Timor were protesting against the loss of lives within their own community. I think there was a rightful response to that knee-jerk reaction which was to say, `What would be achieved? What are we doing by preventing people from voicing their strong feelings, their strong emotions?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Arthur Tunstall joke was raised in the community&mdash;and I think this has been an indication of how little people understand the impact that this bill has or does not have&mdash;people said, `If we had this legislation, the racial hatred legislation, we would have been able to deal with that.' I ask you: how? This legislation does not cover something like that, nor would I be arguing that it should. That does not mean that I in any way would associate with the racist tenor of the joke that was told&mdash;no way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe that the most appropriate mechanism for addressing that problem is to let people express their opposing views to show that those kinds of expressions are out of place in a harmonious and tolerant society that values diversity, that affirms people's racial differences and different cultures which they bring to our community. I believe that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) actually dealt with it very adequately by speaking out strongly. We do not need to be waving a gaol penalty around to prove the point that those kinds of off-taste jokes are acceptable in this day and age in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, when the even more serious incident occurred of the tragic desecration of the grave of Eddie Mabo in Queensland, people were saying, `If we had racial hatred legislation it would have dealt with that. It would not have happened.' Sadly, that is totally inaccurate but it does not mean that there is not redress in cases of that seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, the Queensland state laws would cover the desecration and damage to a grave. The penalties that are associated with that would highly likely involve the serious end of the continuum and may well involve imprisonment according to the other mitigating factors that were involved. So the state penalties already cover that. Furthermore, this particular bill would not cover that because this bill could have been brought into operation only if somebody had threatened to do that. It is not the actual damage or the actual racism expressed in the words that could be dealt with by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual publicising of that incident, I believe, illustrates that our community has changed radically over the years. There was a time, and I still regret that it is there, when many people would have seen racism as permanently institutionalised within the Australian community. We have moved far from the White Australia Policy. It does not mean that everybody within our community is at the same stage in that, but certainly we have moved. We have institutionalised racism still in existence in our criminal justice system, in our prisons and in our police lock-ups because we have criminal justice systems that overimprison people. Those people could have a very good argument for saying it is their race that causes their overimprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would this racial vilification law address the institutionalised racism of the Australian society? No, it would not. In fact, it could well be counterproductive by adding a weapon to that armoury of institutionalised racism when, as Father Frank Brennan pointed out, Aboriginal people who are complaining about the treatment they are receiving could easily become a target for being sentenced under this law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the culture of coercion that this bill seeks to set up is merely that. I do not have a fear of these laws being enforced. I believe that is a major comfort to the people who have asked for the bill: they believe that it will be enforced. I do not think the bill is enforceable; there are far too many problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if it were to be enforced it would create even more problems and I believe we would see the unintended consequences of a possibly well-intentioned bill. There are those who say, `No, no, we do not ever intend it to be enforced. It is just there as a signal. It is a deterrent.' When will our society learn&mdash;as America has failed to learn&mdash;that creating new criminal offences and toughening penalties is not a deterrent. It is perceived to be a deterrent by those who do not contravene the law. Over and over again it has been proven to have failed to affect those who do contravene the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deterrents will not operate unless the three psychological principles of deterrence are applied. The first principle is that the punishment must fit the crime; it must be appropriate. It must be perceived to be appropriate by the person who has committed the offence in order for it to act as a deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle is that it must be consistently applied to everybody across the community&mdash;not just to the powerless and those who cannot afford legal defences. Nobody should be immune: not politicians, radio announcers or all those who really are indemnified by the framing of this legislation. In order to be a deterrent it has to be consistently applied across the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle is that it has to be immediate in its consequences. It is rather like house-training a puppy: if you smack it a long distance from the misdemeanour that has occurred you have no hope of teaching it anything. These laws are framed in such a way that they are ineffectual by the time they arrive on the doorstep of anybody who may have caused a racist offence. It does not reach the people who may be expressing racist views because, I can assure the Senate, no-one who expresses racist views believes that they are racist. They always think that they are right. So there is no point in waving legislation at them and trying to make them into criminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having expressed my concerns about the criminal sanctions in the bill, I would like to say that I welcome the second part of the bill which deals with access to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Section 9 of the Racial Discrimination Act already implies an avenue for complaint, but this bill will make it explicit and symbolic. It will send a signal that it is unacceptable. It will send a signal that people have an avenue for redress. It says that if you have suffered racial vilification you can be assured of access to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is similar to provisions against sexual harassment and domestic violence, although neither of these have penalties under federal law but rely on state criminal codes. I believe that civil remedies such as those provided by the HREOC are appropriate federal measures to address injustices and to fulfil our international treaty obligations. Criminal penalties are not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be proposing an amendment to the title of the bill. The title is wholly inappropriate to the positive motivation that the bill should be trying to promote. A racial hatred bill in the Year of Tolerance to promote racial tolerance is simply a contradiction in terms. I believe that this act should rather be cited as the racial tolerance act. I will be proposing amendments to that effect and to eliminate the three criminal sanctions that have been proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens acknowledge that this is a complex matter and that there are different views in the community.

To justify this kind of law, you are really saying that multiculturalism has been an abominable failure and a monumental failure.

<PARA>It has not been put more eloquently than by Phillip Adams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to my second ground for objection to this piece of legislation; that is, the question of the head of power under which it is enacted. It is legitimate to ask what authority the Commonwealth parliament has to enact this restriction on the freedom of speech. We presume that the source of constitutional authority is the external affairs power. So again we have a Labor government using the external affairs power to pass laws clearly and unequivocally dealing with purely domestic issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australians who drafted our constitution and the Australians who voted in support of it would no doubt be horrified to learn that a federal government was using the external affairs power to restrict the freedom of speech. What Australians can and cannot say is, frankly, an internal affair; it is not an external affair and it has nothing to do with the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, this bill and the enactment of it under this head of power simply reinforce the argument that the constitution does need amendment to restrict the external affairs power to the purposes for which it was originally intended. It is wrong to use this head of power to give the federal government the authority to decide what Australians can and cannot say, because that is what this bill purports to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that in-principle issue of the use of the external affairs power to enact legislation like this, there is the specific question about whether this is an act that is valid even under the current High Court's very wide interpretation of the external affairs power. The Parliamentary Library's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> argues persuasively that there must be some doubt about the constitutional validity of the civil offences created by this bill and, if this bill does pass, no doubt it will be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say in any event as a committed federalist&mdash;putting that argument to one side&mdash;that it is my firm view that laws such as this should not be the province of the Commonwealth government at all. I adhere firmly to the principle of subsidiarity&mdash;which I am pleased to see is growing in its support around the world, most particularly in the European Union&mdash;that is, that laws should be made at the lowest possible level of government if we are to sustain democracy and people's commitment to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any demonstrated need for laws such as this dealing with racial hatred&mdash;and I commend Senator Chamarette for arguing the offensiveness of that in itself; we ought to be talking about racial tolerance&mdash;which need this government has not put forward, then it should be a matter for state governments. It is for state governments to determine the need for laws such as this and act accordingly. We do have different societies, different positions, different values and different compositions around Australia, and it is for states to respond accordingly if the need is demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the New South Wales government, as this federal government has said, has decided that that state needed a law dealing with racial vilification, and such a law was enacted in 1989. It is proper for the New South Wales government to come to the view that in that particular state, which has a different composition, different pressures and different status, such a law is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to comment on the rights or wrongs of the New South Wales law, but I respect the right of that parliament to enact such a law. I believe that is the appropriate place for decisions to be made on laws such as this and, as I understand it, the ACT, Western Australia and Queensland have also introduced laws dealing with this subject. Again, it is proper for those states to decide accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other states in Australia, which are different, have decided not to introduce such laws and, again, it is quite proper for them to conclude that such laws are not necessary in their particular communities. It should be continually noted that all states have laws dealing with threats to cause injury to people or property. Those laws exist, are enforced and applied, and cover many of the situations envisaged by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I join with all my colleagues on this side of the chamber, and with many Australians and many Labor sympathisers, in opposing this bill. I think it is a frightening application of the rules of political correctness; I do think it is an undue and unwarranted restriction on our freedom of speech; and I also believe that it is a very dangerous precedent for restricting other forms of speech dealing with matters other than race. That, I think, is also sobering. I do not believe the government has put forward any compelling evidence to justify the draconian measures included in this bill. I do believe, like Phillip Adams, that this is a genuine threat to the intellectual and political liberties of Australians and that it should be rejected by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At last we have had a debate on this legislation. At last we have come to what is almost the end of a long road of deliberation on a bill which is important to our community, the Racial Hatred Bill, as it has been important to so many other communities across the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with a degree of sorrow that I have had to listen this morning to some of the speakers from the opposition. We have before us this piece of legislation, this sort of initiative, this sort of measure. The world has come to a decision on the need for a measure such as this through the ICCPR. Western democracies, whether they be the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, or the 20 states of the USA, have introduced legislation like this. This is the global perspective. Looking at the perspective within Australia, there are so many states taking measures here as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been some 21 years since the Racial Discrimination Act was first introduced into this place. There were people who then opposed this act, which has been working vibrantly since those times. There also was a long process of consultation on a bill which was introduced before the last election&mdash;a bill much broader in impact than this one; a bill which received bipartisan support before that election and which was entrenched in Fightback. Despite all this, at the end of the debate on the bill now before us the Senate in this parliament and the opposition on a federal level in this country are the only institutions that are resisting a measure which has both social and economic impact on this country, as it has had on other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I never expected any joy from the Greens and, to the extent that we have got some, we understand where they come from. But it is the opposition that I find very disappointing in this particular measure because they are isolated in the Australian parliamentary community. They are isolated in terms of institutions across the world in their not recognising the need for a measure such as this one. They do not live up to their promise of the past, a promise made by leader after leader after leader. Maybe we will have to have another leader before they change their situation here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not live up to the promises, the expectations of their state parties and state parliaments, and they do not live up to their responsibility to the Australian community. Unfortunately, their position is one without a will to embrace this legislation. It is a position where they now have to resort to dishonesty in terms of a changed position, in terms of the arguments they put forward this morning. It is a position which reflects a lack of appreciation of the communities involved here and a keenness to manipulate them, one against the other, for their sordid little interests. It is a lack of understanding of the issue of race. It is an issue with which they have not been able to come to grips. It is an issue with which their current leader has never been able to come to grips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time after time over the last 12 months or so, whether it is Mabo, the land fund or issues that arise from day to day&mdash;the rights of Aboriginal footballers such as Nicky Winmar or the rights of the Kathy Freemans of the world&mdash;the opposition is the one force in the Australian political system that cannot understand the importance, and not just in a social context but in an economic context in our global environment, that the issue of race has for Australia and within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our starting point on this side of the parliament is that we are a racially diverse society. We have within our boarders some 240 different ethnic communities. One in four Australians are of a non-English speaking background. We have a society which has over the last 50 years absorbed 5 1/2 million migrants and done so enormously well. The harmony that we have here is not just something we boast about to ourselves; it is something which the rest of the world recognises, through international forums, through the fact that the United Nations held its global diversity conference in Sydney just a few months ago in recognition of the harmonious situation we have here. But in recognising it we and the rest of the world recognise that it is not perfect here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are still living as the butts of racial hatred and racial vilification. There are good reasons for governments to take a stand to ensure that the harmony in our society is developed and that people living in our society feel as if they are an equal part of our society and cannot be subjected to racial hatred. As I said, there are social reasons but there are also good economic reasons. An inclusive society is a successful one. A society which can be fragmented because of the issue of race is one that has problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not think and the government does not think that Australia can afford not to join with other democracies and take a stand on racial vilification. That is where we differ from the opposition. We recognise there is a need&mdash;a need other countries have responded to with legislation like this. The extent of the need has been documented quite frequently, inquiry after inquiry. The human rights commission inquiry found hundreds of cases, not thousands, of people who had been subjected to racial vilification. We recognise that in an environment such as that governments have a responsibility in the interests of the dignity of all individuals to send a message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Chris Puplick, who was here just a few months ago in a historic sense, commented on this issue in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 5 November 1994. It is worth placing this paragraph on the record to give people a real understanding of what we are talking about. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1989, New South Wales has had comprehensive racial vilification laws in place. They have worked well. They have provided a sound basis for public education programs; they have helped change workplace and institutional attitudes towards racism; they have assisted numerous individuals to do better in their lives and they have in no way impacted upon civil liberties or the vigorous pursuit and practice of free speech in this state.</PARA>
<PARA>An honest statement by former Liberal Senator Chris Puplick. He recognised the fundamental importance of having a two-pronged response&mdash;both education and legislation. He has made that very clear as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to send a message to individuals in our society, to tackle the issue that Tim Fischer raised in Adelaide in April this year. When talking about the situation in my home state of South Australia, he was concerned with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . extreme fanaticism of one kind or another in the Australian community and the subtle movement of certain groupings out of Sydney and Melbourne to Adelaide because of perceived differences in certain State legislation, which is affording them a degree of opportunity and there is some evidence of that around that Adelaide has become the new, sadly, the new networking capital for some of this extremism.</PARA>
<PARA>Tim Fischer acknowledged the need for governments to send a message and to be consistent about it. The best way to do that is to have national legislation. But it is the National Party tail&mdash;Fischer and Katter&mdash;who are dragging the Liberal Party from the barrier on this. They know it, and that is why they do not have the will to face up to this issue in the interests of individual Australians and the national good in general. That is why we have had all this moving around this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to Chris Puplick, let me say that he recognises a need for legislation and sanctions to provide the foundation for the education programs. Our response as a government has been to recognise that one has to balance, in this particular area, the rights of the victims with the rights of individuals. We do so by our response to this legislation. Our response is not just a legislative one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition have come in here and said&mdash;and they have said to the community as well&mdash;`We are going to give $10 million to overcome racism through education campaigns.' That is actually a cutback. This financial year alone we have announced funding in excess of $10 million across the spectrum of government&mdash;whether it is the in the school place or workplace. In my own portfolio, I think the figures we counted this morning were somewhere near $9 million alone. Let us also, as we should, toss in HREOC and the programs that I announced just a few days ago&mdash;the need for traditional awareness programs and programs in law schools and wherever. These are all specific measures targeted to overcome racism in our society. We are already spending more than the opposition is promising in a very dishonest way. We are spending it in very targeted programs from the school place to the workplace, in the broader community, through the media, to target the issue of racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got the programs, the money is there&mdash;more than they have promised&mdash;but when you look at the educative response, you do not get details from the opposition. Ten million dollars&mdash;but over how long? Who knows? No-one has been told. By whom? What programs? What areas? Who will be targeted? We have no idea. They have just dragged a figure out of the air and thought they would buy off the communities with that figure. As a consequence, they have come in here and claimed they would rather educate than take the hard decision. We have provided for $9.193 million this financial year in funding for combating racism through education or community relations strategies; $12.99 million, next year. We are spending $21 million over the current two years, as opposed to a $10 million promise from the opposition, with no time limit on it. They are a sham and should be exposed as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the legislation, we recognise we have to protect individuals' rights to freedom of speech. We also recognise that there are already nine, 10 or 11 areas of speech crimes&mdash;crimes which attach to speech, speech which reflects socially unacceptable action such as defamation, criminal law, indecency, obscenity, offensive behaviour, sexual harassment, conspiracy, incitement, contempt of court, pornography or false advertising. They are all speech crimes but they are crimes which society and government have recognised need a legislative response because the behaviour that attaches to them is such that we can do without it and it has a deleterious effect on our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Racial vilification stands, I think, very squarely within that basket of speech crimes. We recognise we can deal with it in a balanced way. We recognise that the sorts of actions involved here are such that do require a response from the government. The difference between us and the other side is that the consequences of racial vilification and the consequences of this speech are acceptable to them. That is the dividing line between our side and the Democrats, and the opposition on this particular issue. They come to it with a history of deception; they come to it with a bill, which I do not think I could give a better description of than appears in the press statement issued by the Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales. Angela Chan is an undaunted advocate on behalf of communities, a person who takes no intimidation from any side of parliament. Her description of the opposition's response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a meaningless sham. It provides for only one remedy against racist attack, a penalty for actually threatening physical harm, and that, of course, is already against the law.</PARA>
<PARA>What Angela does not say is that the opposition, in their depiction and framing of it, have produced a bill which is unworkable because of requirements for tests of reasonableness and all sorts of aspects they have tossed into it. Because of the levels of proof required on so many levels&mdash;the subjectivity tests, the sole reason requirement&mdash;their bill is unprosecutable. It is also different from the New South Wales legislation, legislation which they promised. It is jumbled in wording and is such that it quite clearly warrants the description by the New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of our position&mdash;this is a pretty important starting point in assessing the government's legislation, contrary to the bland assertions in an endeavour to deceive on the other side&mdash;the best description once again comes from New South Wales anti-discrimination commission president, Chris Puplick. He said that he did not believe that either the New South Wales legislation or the federal legislation restricted free speech, that generally the New South Wales laws were more broad ranging and that the federal laws would target specific acts with stiffer penalties. We are talking here about a more measured response than the Greiner measure of New South Wales. If the opposition is too gutless to embrace a measure which Nick Greiner embraced in the broader way then I can understand why he would make comments about the gutlessness of the opposition responses to policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another instance where the opposition, confronted with a national issue in this place, have not had the guts, nor the talent, nor the policy framework with which to respond to it. They do not understand the importance of race. They do not understand society. They do not understand the importance of issues like this. As a consequence, they have dragged out this debate whilst they have been dragged backwards by the National Party. Fisher and Katter have made their decision on this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You know full well that it is not rubbish, Senator Panizza. Look at our measures. They are tight. They are concise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So our starting point is that, like the rest of the world, we believe that there is a need for this legislation. We recognise the positiveness of our community but we also recognise that we have to work as a society, government and community together, to overcome racism in this society. We have to do that through education and conciliation as well as criminal sanctions. If you are not serious enough to send a criminal sanction message in this legislation, then the fact that you are not sending that message will be taken by racists in our community as somewhat of a yellow light for their behaviour. Coming from South Australia, I know that pretty well from the sorts of groups we have acting in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about this as a social issue, but do not underestimate the importance of the Australian Parliament sending a message, not just to Australia but to the rest of the world, that we believe that racial vilification is not on. We work in a global environment. We trade with the rest of the world. Our interaction with our region and the rest of the world is not on a financial basis alone. Our interests are developing and growing. They are foreign security, they are social, they are cultural. Our links are very strong. You cannot say to the rest of the world, `We do not mind taking the money but we have something about the issue of race that we are not all that comfortable about.' To be consistent and fair to our future as a nation economically and socially, we have no alternative but to support measured legislation like this.

However, whether that demonstrates more care for their concerns, when you cannot deal with the problem in a proactive and preventive way, is a difficulty. I believe that it is in the civil remedies that any real address of the problems of victims is seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the whole matter of education was raised, I want to ask the minister a question about it. There is very little mention in this bill of education. I searched for it and eventually found it in the explanatory memorandum. I was discouraged to see that the emphasis was primarily on educating people about this legislation, if it were to be passed. Having accepted that the numbers will preclude any change in the name of the bill from the Racial Hatred Bill to the Racial Tolerance Bill, the absence of any educative measure in it or the absence of any real concern that we show tolerance and respect for a diversity of views mean that it would not be appropriate to have the bill's name changed either, as Senator Vanstone has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that the spirit of the bill, if this is what it is, is not capable of being reflected in the title more accurately. It looks as though we are promoting racial hatred by calling it the Racial Hatred Bill. Perhaps we could mention opposition to racial hatred. The point I am making&mdash;I do not want the minister to forget my question about education&mdash;is that the positive underlying motivation, if there is one, is not being reflected in the title. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thanks very much for that question, Senator Spindler. I think the thrust of your question is spot on&mdash;you have to combat it in an interactive way.

I ask the minister what his understanding is of the clash between the state offences that are already covered under the offences of threat of damage to property or threat of harm to persons and this legislation. My understanding is that there are two possible problems. One is that the penalties outlined in these clauses would be lesser than those available in all the states. If these laws were to operate in such a way that racist violence carried a lesser penalty than non-racist violence, I think it would present a significant problem which the federal government has created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the coalition, I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Authorities (Australian Capital Territory Pay-roll Tax) Bill. The legislation is supported by the coalition. Essentially, the bill is intended to rectify an oversight that occurred at the time self-government was proclaimed for the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat surprising that it has taken nearly eight years to identify this oversight and to take action to resolve the situation, particularly given that taxation revenue was at issue. The bill applies only to those Commonwealth authorities who, immediately before the commencement of the ACT payroll tax regime, were registered as employers or had an application for registration pending under the payroll tax regime of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory. It will have no application to other Commonwealth authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will create a payroll tax liability for these authorities which, as I have already stated, were technically not subject to ACT payroll tax liability because of general exempting provisions in an act or under regulation. These provisions will place the payroll tax treatment of certain Commonwealth authorities operating in the ACT on a similar footing to those Commonwealth authorities operating in the states or in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clause 6 of the bill is designed to protect various collections of payroll tax by the ACT government. As stated in the explanatory memorandum and supplementary memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those Commonwealth authorities that have paid ACT pay-roll tax before Royal Assent to the Bill will not be able to recover the payments.</PARA>
<PARA>The clause is necessary to protect the revenue of the ACT. Were this clause not to be included in the legislation, a Commonwealth authority which had paid ACT payroll tax under the mistaken belief that it had a legal objection would have been able to have an action to recover the tax erroneously paid. The ACT revenue base would have been detrimentally affected and the ACT government would most likely have sought recompense from the Commonwealth. Clause 6 will make such an administrative roundabout unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the government has picked up the coalition's concerns in respect of the wording of clause 6, and the coalition will be supporting the government's proposed amendment. This amendment will make clear that, where a payment has been made by a relevant Commonwealth authority, the fact that the payment was not previously required by law is not relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the redrafted clause 6, the coalition supports the passage of this bill and supports the provisions in the bill which prevent the Commonwealth authorities from claiming back from the ACT government the amounts paid in payroll tax from 1 August 1987 to date. The bill is clearly long overdue, and the coalition is pleased to see its passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I was not here when the legislation was first called on is that this government still has not given me a copy of the guidelines for one of the schedules and I was up in my office waiting for them to come through. They were promised to me and I was sitting there waiting, so I do have a legitimate excuse for not having been here. Here we are debating this bill at a lunch time and I am still waiting in my office for the guidelines for a bill that has come before the house. I think the government could have got their act together and got those guidelines to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 will make amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and associated pieces of legislation. Overall, the coalition is supportive of these amendments. However, there are basically four areas which have raised concern. They are: firstly, schedule 3 and, in particular, the amendment to the amendment bill relating to the Italian international social security agreement; secondly, schedule 4, which relates to the clarification of the qualification requirements for the disabilities support pension and the disability wage supplement; thirdly, schedule 14 on the issue of the native title rights and interests which are not to be taken into account when applying the asset test in the act; and, fourthly, schedule 16 and the issue of split compensation settlements and the application of provisions to claimants and assessment of periodic and lump sums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to these areas the coalition has had representations from a number of groups, including the Welfare Rights Centre and the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee has also considered these amendments and the representations further, as well as giving the department the opportunity to justify the amendments being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to schedule 3, the amendment to the bill relates to Australia's social security agreement with Italy. We will be supporting this amendment, which is basically a technical one posing no real changes. This amendment will clear up the current situation which has arisen out of the new agreement between the Australian and the Italian governments not having been ratified in Italy, due to the delays in the Italian legislative process. This has resulted in the old agreement remaining in force. However, it is no longer a scheduled international social security agreement under section 1208 of the principal act. Therefore, because the old agreement has been repealed and the new agreement has not entered into force, social security payments made on the basis of the agreement and out of consolidated revenue have not been validly made. The amendment will correct this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 proposes that the rules be altered to clarify the qualification requirements in relation to the disability support pension. This proposed narrowing of eligibility raises some cause for concern, particularly in regard to a lack of energy or motivation and the extent to which this factor should be related to a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20 per cent or more. The concern raised in the committee hearings is the possibility that people who have a lack of energy or motivation as the natural consequence of a long-term illness or pain could be excluded from payment and access to the disability reform package program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department dealt with this by saying that each case would be assessed individually and that people who generally had a lack of motivation as a result of an illness or disability would not be excluded from payment. The department has also pointed out that, overall, this is intended to be legislation to benefit recipients and that, if there is an ambiguity in the act with no contrary intention, then it will generally be interpreted in favour of the client. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other cause for concern was raised in relation to people with head injuries and psychiatric problems. With the tightening up of the act, it was argued, this could create some problems in assessing these sorts of cases where the Commonwealth medical officers deemed valid cases not to be entitled to the pensions. In discussions with the department and the minister's office, it was agreed about three days ago that guidelines would be drawn up to give direction or some indicative guidelines to the CMOs. That was discussed approximately three days ago, the shadow minister received the draft yesterday and had some comments to make, and the corrected draft was to be faxed back to him or to my office. That is what I was waiting for in my office, to actually have a look at those guidelines before we got onto the debate. Regrettably, I have not had time to look at them, but what is intended is that these guidelines will be inserted into the AGHS guidelines for CMOs, directing them to refer the matter to an appropriate specialist in certain circumstances. I seek leave to table and to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> those guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The guidelines read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"DSS requires AGHS to seek a report from a psychiatrist or psychologist where:-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The schedule 14 amendment has also generated questions regarding the making of native title rights and interests exempt from the provisions of the assets test. It is proposed to treat native title interests in a similar way to other exempt assets, such as life interests. However, it has been argued the amendments might give someone an advantage, because of their race or culture, over some other person in a similar situation. I guess the basic question was: why separate the native title from everything else? The department responded by saying that, unlike other similar life interests, native title interests in an asset are not realisable as a source of funds to provide an individual or individuals with support, as there could never be any question of selling the property. This is because native title interests are community based in nature. It has also been pointed out that any income derived from a native title right or interest would be assessable under the income test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to other concerns, the department also says that land obtained under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 will not be excluded from assets tests. This is also the case for land obtained under the land acquisition fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of concern for the coalition is in relation to schedule 16. Schedule 16 comprises four distinct initiatives, two of which are at issue: compensation and split settlements and the application of provisions to claimants as well as recipients. Compensation is where two or more lump sum payments made in respect of one disease, injury or condition sustained in one event are treated as one lump sum compensation payment for the purposes of the compensation recovery provisions. There is a 50 per cent rule applied to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to these compensation provisions in the act was also sought by the government in 1993. However, as was clarified in the legislation committee on 23 June, the new amendments are different from the one sought two years ago. Even though they are different, the coalition is still concerned that this could undermine compensation payments in regard to non-economic elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Welfare Rights Centre and other groups have spoken out strongly against this amendment, saying that it undermines legal settlements reached between parties recognising the injuries and loss suffered by a client&mdash;and which are not related to a person's lost earnings&mdash;and that they will be required to use this money to support themselves rather than using it for basic infrastructure costs associated with their disability or injury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern was also expressed that this amendment aimed at preventing double-dipping and people ripping off the system will affect a much larger group of people than was initially intended and that it could affect people who are genuinely entitled to a full payment. In response to this, in an amendment to a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guide to the administration of the Social Security Act part J: disregarding payments of compensation</EMPHASIS>, the department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some cases, the application of the 50 per cent rule to calculate the preclusion period may lead to a result that is harsh or unjust.</PARA>
<PARA>The department then went on to say that, if the economic loss component of a lump sum is considerably less than 50 per cent, this is a factor to consider in deciding whether special circumstances exist. The department provided the coalition with a copy of the letter stating that the new guideline will be inserted in the guide in addition to the existing guidelines relating to disregarding payments of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue of concern to the coalition in relation to schedule 16 is the application of compensation provisions to claimants as well as recipients. Under the compensation preclusion provisions of the act, a person will not receive income support while they have the benefit of a compensation payment for loss of income. Currently, a decision must be made first as to whether a person is qualified for the payment even if it is obvious by the person's circumstances that the person will be precluded from the payment because of the compensation preclusion provisions. The amendment has the effect that the compensation preclusion provisions may be applied to a person first and they may be excluded from a payment without a decision made as to their qualification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is of concern to the Welfare Rights Centre. The centre says that there have been cases when a person has applied for payment and their qualification has not been determined but where they have been refused on the basis of the preclusion rules. The person has then appealed to the SSAT and the AAT and it has been found that the decision to refuse payment was incorrect, but, as no assessment as to qualification has been made, the Department of Social Security continues to assess qualification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ameliorate this situation, the coalition, on behalf of the Welfare Rights Centre, obtained an agreement in writing from the minister. The minister agreed that the following amendments would be made: any client who remains affected by the compensation preclusion provisions after a review will be informed in writing of their right to have their qualification assessed before any SSAT appeal is heard; and any appeal to the SSAT should simultaneously deal with both the payment and eligibility factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the bill was delayed until the spring session, the government has now incorporated this amendment into the bill. The amendment provides that, if a person's claim for a pension fails because of the operation of the compensation preclusion provisions, if that person applies to the SSAT for review of the compensation preclusion decision and if the person requests the secretary to assess his or her qualification for payment, then the secretary must make the qualification assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is acceptable; however, it does not provide for the person to be advised of their right to have their qualification assessed if they are appealing and in the committee stage of the bill I will be pursuing what undertakings the minister will make as to the way in which clients will be advised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out the areas of concern the coalition has about the bill. It is the coalition's view, however, that the department has answered those concerns, particularly with the amendments in relation to split settlements, outlining the discretion available in making decisions relating to this. The coalition will be supporting the amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the government's amendments to the amendment bill. However, we will be monitoring the effect of these amendments and, if the department's assurances are not found to be correct, the coalition will be demanding that the government act to address any shortcomings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. Looking first at the non-budget measures bill, the Democrats acknowledge that there are a number of very welcome measures being introduced through the bill. Whilst many of these measures incur a negligible cost to the government, the benefits to the people involved will be significant. For example, the bill provides that mature-age allowance recipients can continue to claim Commonwealth fringe benefits for six months after they commence employment, that disability support pensioners can retain their fringe benefits for 12 months after they lose their pension because of income and it provides employment and education entry payments to carer pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of this, the bill also provides for the extension of the mobility allowance to handicapped people who are in receipt of either a newstart, jobsearch or youth training allowance. Finally, the bill provides that the ordinary one-week waiting period for people claiming sickness allowance can be waived where the person is in a position of financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of each of these measures will be negligible but the benefits to the people involved will be substantial. The Democrats are pleased to see these amendments and will certainly be supporting them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to the amendments in the bill which relate to the position of people on a carer pension when they travel overseas. The amendments the government is putting forward will allow a carer pensioner to accompany the person they care for overseas for up to three months in any one calendar year and continue to receive their pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the majority of cases, carer pensioners are looking after a person on either a disability support pension or an age pension. Both these pensions continue payments for up to 12 months while the recipient is overseas and, in some cases, for an even longer period. So the practical effect of the government's proposal will be that, if a carer remains overseas for more than three months, then they will lose their pension. At the same time, however, the person they are caring for can continue to receive their pension for a further nine months. This seems to be a ridiculous anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, if the carer wants to keep on receiving their pension, the disability support or age pensioner will have to return with them from overseas within the three-month time limit. This problem has been increased by the phasing out of the wife pension this year as it is expected that about 25 per cent of wife pensioners will transfer over to a carer pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do acknowledge that providing three months portability for carer pensioners is a step in the right direction. However, the Democrats believe that portability for 12 months would be more appropriate, and, surely, I do not have to argue the sense of that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Senate inquiry when we were discussing the possibility of the amendment the department said, in answer to a question, that there would be a very small number involved, so the cost would be very small. I signal now that I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to provide that a carer pension can continue to be paid for up to 12 months while they are overseas with the person they care for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to what was one of the more contentious measures in this bill, and that is the section relating to the qualification criteria for the sole parent pension. Under the current legislation, to qualify for a sole parent pension, a person must be living separately and apart from their partner. The government apparently believes that under a strict interpretation this could allow people to receive the pension when their partner was away from home only temporarily. The original explanatory memorandum to the bill gave as examples people who were `on holidays, work or study commitments or during short-term domestic disputes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats were disappointed that the government chose to include domestic disputes within these amendments. In particular, we were concerned about the possible impact that this proposed change could have had on women seeking to leave violent domestic situations. We also believe that it would have been unreasonable to expect the Department of Social Security to be able to determine which separations following a domestic dispute were of a short-term nature and which were not. Further, having counselled many women who have been the victims of domestic violence, I know that it is a sad fact of life that many women remain in violent households because they fear they will have no financial support if they leave. The Democrats were gravely concerned that the proposed changes would have only increased that doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with our deep concern over this issue, in question time on 1 March this year, I asked Senator Crowley whether or not the government was conscious of the effect the proposed changes could have on women seeking to leave domestic violence. In response to my representation to her, Senator Crowley said that she would seek further clarification of the government's position either in the explanatory memorandum or during the debate on the legislation. I am pleased to see that, in line with the commitment given in response to my question, the government has now removed the words `during short-term domestic disputes' from the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also added a clause to the memorandum which I would like to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no intention in the amendments to adversely affect people separating in circumstances that involve domestic violence. The amendments will not change the current admission procedures for sole parent pension that deal with situations involving, or potentially involving, domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly welcome the addition of this clause in the memorandum and I thank the government for recognising the concerns and acting appropriately and swiftly on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. I want only to speak very briefly to this legislation as I believe my colleague Senator Lees will expand a little more. I want to concentrate my remarks on the amendments made by schedule 16 of the bill. These amendments deal with the way in which the Department of Social Security treats compensation payments. At the moment, for ease of administration, the Social Security Act assumes that, where any loss of income component can be identified in a compensation payment, 50 per cent of that payment has been made for loss of income. The department then divides this amount by average weekly earnings to calculate the number of weeks a person is to be precluded from social security support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I recognise the administrative benefits of this 50 per cent rule, I still believe that the department should be able to look more closely at individual compensation payments. Even if it is the case that the department loses as much as it gains by the application of this rule, the effect on an individual who may only have received, say, 25 per cent of his or her compensation payment for economic loss could be devastating. The Democrats have always acknowledged the problem of compensation payment construction designed to disguise the true nature of a payment and thereby cost-shift onto the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today seeks to allow DSS, when calculating any preclusion period by means of the 50 per cent rule, to combine two or more lump sum compensation payments which are made for the one compensatable event. The aim of this amendment is to reduce the scope for any sort of artificial payment structuring. The Democrats recognise that this proposal is different from the proposal put forward by the government last year. Our position has always been, however, that we could not support a proposal to address the problem of payment construction which would disadvantage any compensation recipients&mdash;people who, it must be remembered, have been the victims of an industrial or motor accident. As such we will not be supporting schedule 16 of this bill. </PARA>

I wish to stress here that the Democrats will be continuing their opposition to these changes and will be opposing them in the committee stage. I do acknowledge the work that has been going on behind the scenes to at least get some guidelines. However, on reading the draft that we have had tabled before us today I still see huge problems for the most disadvantaged group of people in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, and the Democrats believe, that it is time to draw the line. We have tightened eligibility again and again to the point where these changes will mean that people with significant disabilities are going to miss out on the option of a disability support pension. I am not alone in this. The Democrats and, indeed, the Senate committee have been contacted by a wide range of organisations representing people with disabilities&mdash;the Head Injury Council of Australia, the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition, the National Federation of Blind Citizens, the Uniting Church, the Welfare Rights Centre and a number of community legal centres. They all said the same thing, that these changes are likely to severely disadvantage a group of already disadvantaged people. So we need to look here at the continuing battle between the major parties as to who is really looking after the battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a concrete example of what they do in legislation to a group of battlers and we really have to ask, `How much more difficult can we make it for these people?' Time and time again we sit through debates on social security in this place, and time and time again we see the rules for income support tightened and tightened. And we then wonder why our charities are so overburdened with people who cannot make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disappointing factors in all of this is that it is going to go largely unnoticed. It is not a high profile community issue. Indeed, it is probably going to make scarcely a ripple in any news broadcast anywhere in Australia because it is a very small number of people that we are talking about and it is a group of people that do not have a lot of power and do not have ready access to the media to stand up and to really make a noise about what is happening to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that this is a very real issue about fairness and equity and it is something that the government fairly hastily brought before us as a result of very fair decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Both the government and the coalition know that these decisions are rarely in the public arena and they can get away with changing these rules without any notice whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effectively is being done here is that the changes modify the meaning of the term `continuing inability to work', which is one of the qualification criteria for receiving the DSP. The amendments provide, firstly, that an applicant is not eligible for a disability support pension if their impairment is not by itself sufficient to prevent them from doing any work and, secondly, that an applicant's inability to work or retrain must result directly from the impairment and any consequential results of the impairment will not be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments have to be placed in context. When the disability support pension was introduced in 1991, as the replacement for the invalid pension, the Democrats and a number of groups representing people with disabilities expressed grave concerns about the government's plan to minimise the relevance of non-medical factors in assessing a person's continuing inability to work. I believed then and, indeed, I still believe that it is wrong to exclude non-medical, socioeconomic factors from decisions, when looking at access to the DSP. I think those concerns have been vindicated by the practical operation of the DSP assessment processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is very difficult to ascertain exactly what is going on, it does appear that the department and the Commonwealth medical officers regularly disregard psychological and other factors in assessing whether or not a person meets that minimum 20 per cent impairment level. This has made it difficult for people with a psychological condition, or some other non-medical, socioeconomic handicap, on top of their disability, to get the DSP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the CMOs and the DSS has been criticised by the AAT and the SSAT. The tribunals have shown some degree of flexibility in dealing with the issue of whether particular consequences of an applicant's impairment, such as poor motivation or antisocial behaviour, can be taken into account when there is no medical evidence suggesting an underlying psychiatric condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that it wants to bring consistency into its policy on the DSP and these amendments are clearly a direct response to decisions made by the tribunals. But these amendments want to exclude any recognition of skill levels. It is technically possible under these amendments to exclude virtually any person with an impairment from the DSP, unless that person has a clear and almost total inability to function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of these amendments is that people with disabilities are going to be channelled into JSA and newstart. The government can dress that up in any language it likes but, at the end of the day, that means it is cheaper for government. It will have to pay out less money to people with disabilities, not just because of the level of payments but also because a lot of people in this category are not going to be able to fulfil the requirements to keep jumping through the hoops and to stay on the treadmill that continues their income support. I state again that it is going to further disadvantage a group of people who are already significantly disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability reform package evaluation carried out this year found that DSP recipients received more intensive training assistance more quickly than people with disabilities on JSA and newstart. As the Sydney Welfare Rights Centre pointed out in its submission to the Senate's community affairs committee, narrowing the qualification requirements of DSP might reduce the number of people receiving DSP but it does not reduce the number of people who need long-term income support payments. All it does is shift a group of people off DSP, and onto the unemployment queue on a long-term basis where they will lose priority in accessing appropriate labour market programs and will have to compete for the general labour market programs. And, what is more, they will be forced to comply with JSA and newstart requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welfare rights and disability organisations argue that there are many people who just do not quite make that 20 per cent medical impairment which, when combined with other factors consequential upon their impairment, makes them unemployable. It makes little sense to exclude these people and these factors from the assessment process and then basically channel them off into unemployment benefits and, I would argue, for many of them, onto the charity system in the longer term. JSA and newstart now carry penalties for breaches of certain requirements. It is also placing these people, particularly those who are likely to have behavioural difficulties, at risk of losing their income support altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Organisations representing people with a psychiatric disability are particularly concerned, as the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition pointed out. I acknowledge the work that has gone on behind the scenes for some guidelines for the Commonwealth medical officers, but I still believe that there will be a significant number of people that these do not pick up. It seems to the Democrats that this exercise is really nothing more than a cost cutting and cost shifting exercise, at the expense of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government appears to believe it has a problem with a number of decisions&mdash;I stress, a very small number&mdash;of the AAT and the SSAT to overturn decisions made by the department and therefore give people access to the DSP. However, the problem does not appear to be a large one. It is certainly the case now that the solution to this so-called problem really does lie in better assessment processes and not in the legislation we have before us. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in the Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill is yet another motley collection of disparate provisions which are certain to reinforce the perception of social security legislation as cumbersome, complex and, to many, incomprehensible. The bill, particularly clause 14, as it currently stands relating to the sole parent pension, will set the cause of plain English back a millennium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand the complex nature of the bill, I want to run through some of the areas of social security that will be affected by these amendments: carer's pension; disability support pension; mobility allowance; partner allowance; family payment; sickness allowance; attendance requirements for JSA and NSA; training supplement; activity agreements; disclosure of social security information; the power to collect information; decisions by the minister being subject to internal review or review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal; debt creation provisions of the Social Security Act; the National Health Act; issues relating to health care card concessions; data-matching program; and the telephone allowance, et cetera. It concerns me that we are at the point where we are debating these two bills cognately, when even in one bill there are a whole lot of issues relating to changes to social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing the vast majority of these measures. However, we do have some residual concerns in a number of areas. We will be moving an amendment to remedy one of those areas and we will maintain opposition to a number of others which we do not consider to be in the best interests of social security clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will move an amendment to ensure that certain of the secretary's decision-making powers are subject to an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny. The effect of these amendments will be to subject the secretary's decision-making powers under division 20A to waive particular classes of debt to disallowance. This was an issue that was commented on by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and I would have thought that the department and the minister would have taken this issue up. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is a multi-party committee which assiduously looks at legislation to ensure that it does not infringe the rights of individuals or take away the rights of the parliament. The committee made a comment and, for some reason, the government has chosen to ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposes clauses 23 to 26, 38 and 39 and division 18 of the bill. Clauses 23 to 26 would render decisions of the employment secretary not to approve a particular person's participation in a vocational training course or labour market program for the purposes of training supplement payment non-reviewable. The coalition does not believe that this particular extension of the range of non-reviewable decisions under the act is in the best interest of social security clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also will be opposing division 18 of the bill. It contains a range of provisions which purport to clarify the concept of payability under the Social Security Act 1991. The law, as it currently stands, requires a positive determination by the department before payability of benefits ceases. These provisions would change that and have the effect, amongst other things, of raising debts against clients who have complied with all their obligations under the act. Clients will be forced to bear an unreasonable onus which should properly be borne by the department: the onus to process information in a timely fashion and not allow clients to be prejudiced by any laxity within the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the bulk of this bill may fairly be seen as neither controversial nor involving significant financial impacts. The concerns that we seek to address, whilst few in number, are by no means trivial. Accordingly, our intention to move amendments in some cases and to oppose provisions in others is grounded in the coalition's commitment to ensure that the social security legislation is both accessible, comprehensible and subject to the appropriate level of public scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is not the practice of any government to make publicly available any legal advice received from its advisers, whether it is the Solicitor-General or anybody else, in the course of the normal decision-making process of government. That is a practice that has been observed. It has been so long since you have been in office you have no doubt forgotten, but it is a practice that has been observed by every government from time immemorial. It is part of the norma confidentiality of cabinet process and governmental process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular advice that was tabled by me yesterday was prepared specifically, as was stated in the accompanying statement, for the purpose of explaining publicly what the legal basis on which the government acted was. The original cabinet decision was one to provide for a one-line appropriation, preceded by payment out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, and that had been the subject of discussion, as you would expect, between legal advisers in AGs and the Department of Finance as to the appropriate basis for the payment, among a number of options and alternatives which do exist, including, for example, 34A of the Audit Act. The view was taken that a one-line appropriation was the way to go, and that that would be specifically transparent and open to parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage, particular consideration had not been given to the possible impact of section 48 of the constitution and issues that were subsequently raised in public debate a few weeks later. When that issue was raised in the public debate, some closer legal attention was given to whether in fact there was a problem with a one-line appropriation. It was thought by the Solicitor-General, whose advice was then sought&mdash;and only then, just a few days ago&mdash;that there might be a problem if the matter was just left in terms of reliance on a one-line appropriation next April or May, with money being paid out of the advance now, because of the case of Brown v. West which seemed to be saying that any particular payments made to members of parliament or ministers needed to have some firmer statutory basis for them. His advice to us was essentially that there would be no problem at all about the one-line appropriation itself supporting the payment, but there might be a question mark raised, litigated, as to whether it could be payable under the Advance to the Minister for Finance&mdash;just based on that and that alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, his further advice was that the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, which does contain explicit legislative provision enabling that class of payment to be made, and it gives lawful authority for it, namely, so far as it relates to the carrying on of the functions of a minister, then that particular&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not by itself, but in conjunction with, subsequently of course, the one-line appropriation in order to cover the particular dollar sum. Rather than just being a matter that had to wait for its entire legal authority for the parliamentary appropriation, with 4(4)(b) in place as a result of that case, it was possible to see the nexus or the relationship between the two things. The Solicitor-General advised in those terms, and that is the basis on which the government was confirmed in its original decision to make the payment out of the advance and to follow it with a one-line appropriation, as you would expect, next April but relying in the meantime on the umbrella authority of 4(4)(b) to make the point. That is the basis on which the Solicitor-General advised us orally a few days ago, confirming the original decision that had been taken by the cabinet to go down that particular route.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leader of the federal opposition, Mr John Howard, has described this legislation as a model for his own industrial legislation changes. He has described it as his model. It is important to get on the record the circumstances of that. The legislation was announced by Mr Keirath, the Western Australian industrial relations minister, on 26 May and the draconian nature of it was then spelt out. It was debated during June and July. On 28 July, Mr John Howard said the WA model is a model for the federal industrial relations legislation&mdash;and that was only three weeks ago. On 17 August the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> reported that Mr Keirath rejected the idea that he was withdrawing his second wave legislation because of federal pressure, but then went on to say he had discussed this with Mr Howard and&mdash;I quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;`Mr Howard wholeheartedly supported it'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is extremely conscious of the potential impact that the United States-Japan auto agreement might have had on automotive exports. It was specifically to protect the export interests of these industries, and the very important level of employment in the automotive sector that Senator Cook spoke about so positively yesterday in terms of the major investment decisions that are being made, that he and I decided to establish a special task force to monitor the effects of the US-Japan auto agreement, a group comprising manufacturers, components industries and the union movement, co-chaired by Senator Cook and myself, to ensure that Australian exports benefit from the market openings that Japan is committed to and to ensure that there are no discriminatory deals that cut Australia out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is designed to send a very clear message to both the United States and Japan that we will be vigilant to ensure there are no such deals. Both Senator Cook and I have received assurances at ministerial level in Japan and the United States that the agreement will be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner, and those assurances are very welcome. We are further aided by the fact that we made the decision to participate as the third party in the dispute in the WTO and that has helped our position in obtaining those assurances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we are not merely going to sit back and allow other governments to look after the interests of our industry and our workers. In addition to the task force, we are setting out to establish a channel for discussion with the Japanese and the United States on the effects of the auto agreement on Australia. Therefore, we intend to discuss with the Japanese Minister for International Trade and Industry, Mr Hashimoto, tomorrow during his visit for the AJMC&mdash;the Australia-Japan ministerial consultations&mdash;an initiative for Australia and Japan to meet each year after the annu6al consultations between the United States and Japan on the implementation of the agreement. So that we will equally have the opportunity to ensure that Australia's interests are protected and that through the task force which is monitoring the trends in exports we will have an avenue to put that information directly to the Japanese industry and the Japanese government. Japan is fully aware of the direct commercial stake Australia has in the implementation of the auto agreement and I am quite optimistic we will get agreement on the establishment of such discussions during the course of tomorrow's meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar proposal has been put to the United States trade representative seeking what is, in effect, a parallel although not identical arrangement.

The Commonwealth funding of $269 million has been made available under that national mental health strategy and, of that, $188 million has been made available to the states and territories to assist in service restructuring in a manner consistent with the strategy. So the concern you raise is a matter of very grave importance. As I say, the minister has that under consideration, and I will certainly let you know should anything further come to hand.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice by Senator Abetz this day, relating to ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the things the people of Australia are clamouring for is integrity in government. One would have thought that when a minister, especially the Leader of the Government in the Senate, is asked about the standards that the Prime Minister applies to Labor ministers, he would have accepted the opportunity to outline to the people of Australia the sorts of standards and the disciplines that apply to his ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Senator Gareth Evans failed to do that. In his failure to do so, he has confirmed the very worst fears of the people of Australia. The longer this government is in power, the further the arrogance and the attitude of this government will be exposed. First of all, the former numbers-cruncher, the person who got Mr Keating the job of Prime Minister, acknowledged in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever It Takes</EMPHASIS> that lying was part of his political weaponry. We then had in recent times Senator Robert Ray acknowledging that in politics we are not concerned about fairness and those sorts of qualities but only the outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In recent times the question of the truthfulness of the ministers of this government has been aired quite considerably, and it is no wonder that it has been aired. If we look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 10 November 1992 in the Western Australian parliament, we see that the then Premier and now Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) said about the petition in relation to Penny Easton:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I learned the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling. That is the way it is, and that is the way I have explained it; that is the position.</PARA>
<PARA>She claimed that she only learned about the general thrust of the petition after it was tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without prejudging the outcome of the Marks royal commission, the significant fact is that her former deputy premier and many of her other ministerial colleagues and her senior staff members have given a version of events that would suggest at the very least the minister was aware of the `general thrust of the petition'&mdash;to adopt Dr Lawrence's term&mdash;well and truly prior to its tabling. It is for that reason that we on this side of the house have been pursuing the question of Dr Lawrence's integrity and whether she ought to stand down whilst the royal commission is under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A suggestion has now come into this debate that we on this side of the house are trying to link the unfortunate suicide of Penny Easton to the tabling of the petition. I can refer honourable senators to a doorstop interview undertaken by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) today in which he says very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make it very clear that the Opposition is not, I am not and nobody will be asserting that Carmen Lawrence was responsible for Penny Easton's death.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course I agree with that, and I would not wish to draw that link in relation to this debate. The Labor Party would like to make us do that because that way it will divert our attention from what Carmen Lawrence actually said and did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allow me to remind the Senate that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Western Australia on 10 November 1992 tells us that Dr Lawrence learned the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling. We have had a whole cricket team&mdash;11 people so far&mdash;giving a version of events in great contradistinction to that. Whilst there is a cloud over the minister, she ought to stand down until such time as the Marks royal commission has made its determination in relation to the veracity of that version of events. It is to the government's shame that Senator Gareth Evans refused to dissociate himself from Senator Graham Richardson's comments and failed to respond to my question and to take the opportunity to outline that the government was concerned about integrity in politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a recurring theme, and it was expected that it would be, given the fact that the opposition is taking the politically understandable course of trying to score points against the government. But what those opposite ought to distinguish between in that exercise is the mixing together of some sort of legal approach that they might purport to take, which implies that they are going about this in a responsible, calm and reasonable fashion, and the political exercise they are on about. Clearly, what they are on about is a political exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz, for example, said there is a cricket team of witnesses against Carmen Lawrence, the minister in question. That is not a legal proposition because, as Senator Abetz knows full well and as such great judges as Justice Richard Newton used to say, it is not a proper legal exercise to count up the number of witnesses on one side and compare it with the number of witnesses on the other side, and to conclude that because one side has more witnesses than the other, that side is right. That is certainly not a legal proposition. A political proposition, it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A political proposition is what Senator Abetz so effectively put. But he is not&mdash;nor is anybody on the other side&mdash;to be seen as putting forward legal propositions that have any merit. That is not what they are doing; and it is proper that that be understood. This is an exercise to get&mdash;and I think nobody pretends it is otherwise&mdash;Carmen Lawrence. That is what it is all about. As an exercise in that, they put questions which are quite objectionable to Senator Evans, `Do you countenance lying? Are you a part of a government that countenances lying?' There are all sorts of political questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite get a political answer, which is what is justified, they then get very upset and say, `Oh, no. You should not take this approach. We are here as responsible quasi-legal people going on in a very proper way asking these questions. When you do not give us an answer that we really want we are going to impugn you because you are acting in a political way, even though we are acting in a political way.' If you ask the leader of my party, Senator Evans, questions that are political I, as a backbencher, expect him to give a political answer and treat them on the basis that they are put&mdash;as a means of trying to gain an advantage for one side and a disadvantage for the other side, which is what we are all about in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what we cannot and should not be obliged to accept is an exercise of saying that somehow there is a moral virtue on the other side that is founded on some proper sort of legal basis and that on this side, when we give an appropriate answer, that has not got the same sort of quality. The sorts of questions you are asking and the sorts of answers we are giving are of exactly the same quality and are very proper. I think Senator Evans has done an outstanding job, from the point of view of being a leader of a political party, just as you have attempted to do a job on your side in trying to bring political disadvantages upon us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's remember that there is one body that purports to be an umpire in this; that is, the royal commission. But that is the one body that nobody really wants to let do work. We want to set up all sorts of commissions; we want to set up a Senate committee to investigate; we want to do anything but let this body go around in a quiet and calm way to come to a conclusion that you say it wants to. What you are using this commission for is to get evidence before it which you can then use in this chamber in a political way. The exercise you are going through is not to stand aside and let this commission go about its business; you are doing anything but that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think a great deal is to be gained by tracking any further over the detail of this exchange which can, after all, only be known to the two people engaged in it, General Baker and General Mantiri. But I think there obviously has been some misunderstanding in the way in which the conference has been characterised by Senator Margetts and, presumably, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. I have no doubt that General Baker was expressing his own personal sympathy for General Mantiri. He was probably saying that there was a strong measure of respect and appreciation within the Australian defence forces for the role that General Mantiri had played in building closer links between the Indonesian and Australian militarys, because all those things are true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General Mantiri had been one of those in the Indonesian system most closely associated with building and nourishing those links. That is, no doubt, why he was thought by President Suharto to be a particularly appropriate choice. I have no doubt that there was a lot of warmth expressed in the conversation. But, equally, I have no doubt whatsoever&mdash;because I consulted with General Baker both before and after he had the conversation&mdash;that the essence of the conversation was to try to get the message to General Mantiri that, whatever the degree of personal friendship he could be expected to maintain with people in Australia, his friends in Australia, in particular General Baker, thought that he was going to be in for a very difficult time if he in fact came to the country, for reasons I earlier spelt out, and that it really would be better in all the circumstances if there was some reconsideration of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is my very clear understanding of what the gist of that particular conversation was. It was a conversation that I, in fact, encouraged General Baker to have with General Mantiri because I thought it might help&mdash;in all the circumstances&mdash;smooth the way for an easier resolution of this particular problem. I have no doubt whatsoever that that was the flavour and substance of the conversation. Again, people's recollections of conversations, as with their recollections of events, can be quite different, can be quite fallible.

I do not think it is surprising that the aspects that you have recorded there from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program&mdash;General Mantiri's interview&mdash;tend to accentuate the more positive aspects of that particular conversation.

This morning I got in touch with the Chairman of the Arabic Council, Mr Roland Jabbour, since Mr Joe Wakim, the Secretary with whom I have dealt before, is overseas at the moment. Mr Jabbour confirmed that they were concerned that in some ways the bill does not go far enough because it does not address very specifically the educative process that protects people who are members of the ethnic community and who could be exposed, in the privacy of their own home sometimes, to vilification, threats of violence and even assaults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He took great care to say that, while they did not think the bill went far enough to address some of those concerns, they did not want to be interpreted as saying that they opposed the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler says that those people who oppose and have opposed criminal sanctions care more for the free speech of the perpetrators of evil than for the victims of such evil. I might say that that is something of a dramatisation of the case. As I said at the very beginning, this is not an exercise about who is more opposed to racial hatred. The suggestion put by Senator Spindler is that we are not really worried about racial hatred, we are more worried about free speech, and therefore we do not care about the perpetrators of racially based statements about others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is clearly not the case. I had hoped that this would not degenerate into a debate about, `I am in favour of this, therefore you are not.' Sadly, that is the level to which Senator Spindler is thinking of dragging this debate. I do not think there is a federal parliamentarian who is in favour of racial hatred. There could not be one in the Senate or in that other place that we rightly call the lower house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we understand that&mdash;unless Senator Spindler wants to make some direct accusations rather than skirt around the issue with words&mdash;we might agree that, if we are all opposed to racial hatred, all we are discussing is the best way to deal with it. We have made it abundantly clear that we think there are two things to bear in mind. Firstly, there is the need for an additional $10 million for education. It is clear that the government has moved this way in domestic violence areas. I would have thought that there should be some support for using that amount to combat this type of evil in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the essence of our opposition to the government's criminal sanctions goes to the way that the government has designed them&mdash;in particular proposed section 60. That is the section that Senator Spindler was referring to when he said words to the effect, `It is so often those who incite hatred who do so and it leads to violence. That is why we support these sanctions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler neglected to say that the consequence of supporting the government's criminal sanctions, phrased as they are, is that those people who want to express a view&mdash;and it may be of hatred&mdash;and who want to get others to agree; who are encouraging others to agree with their view, as repulsive as we may find it; who are not persons who want to go and cause any physical damage to personal property and who are not inciting any personal violence and violence does not flow&mdash;under the government's proposed section 60 that sort of person would still be liable to a gaol penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, Senator Spindler may say, `But that wouldn't happen.' He might have more confidence in law enforcement agencies than I do. If you draft a clause that says, `This behaviour is criminal,' you cannot then pretend that it has another clause attached to it that says, `Hey, you'll only ever be charged with this if some other consequences follow.' If that is what you mean, that is what you should say in the clause. But it does not say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the great deceptions that have been foisted upon the ethnic communities&mdash;I made this point yesterday in my speech on the second reading&mdash;by people who should know better, people who should have taken the opportunity to inform themselves. Mr Victor Rebikoff is one of those and Helen Teischman is another who have consistently, either out of ignorance or design&mdash;I do not know which but either is unsatisfactory, because when you hold yourself out to be a community leader you should get across the information&mdash;portrayed the view that the government's bill will only apply when violence is generated, and that that is the aim of it. Either they have not read the bill or they seek to misrepresent the bill, and the sorts of remarks Senator Spindler was making just then continue to misrepresent that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case we make is that proposed section 60 is an unjustified limitation on freedom of speech&mdash;not because you should necessarily be able to go out and say what you like, but you should be able to say what you like if you are not promoting violence. That is the point that Senator Spindler forgets and that he seeks to gloss over in the remarks he made. He seeks to pretend, yet again, that proposed section 60 of the government's bill would have only got at people who were promoting violence, when that is simply not the case. It is an untruth, and he should not be allowed to perpetrate it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to prolong the debate. Most of the things I wanted to say are contained in the debate on the second reading, but I want to respond briefly to some of the points that Senator Spindler made in relation to my speech on the second reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, Senator Spindler, I certainly acknowledge that FECCA, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, does publicly support the bill. That has never been at issue and, indeed, I made that point in my speech. What I did say as well was that privately there are some differing views. You would not expect those to become public, but I do accept the point&mdash;and made it myself&mdash;that FECCA does publicly support the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You also mentioned the Australian Arabic Council and your contact with Roland Jabbour today. I have not spoken to him since my speech yesterday, but I have had very lengthy discussions with him, Joe Wakim and other members of the Australian Arabic Council over a period of a year or more now. We have had written correspondence, and they have made public statements themselves as an association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I said in my speech yesterday on the bill was that the Australian Arabic Council, although less condemnatory of the bill than the Australian Arab Association, which I will mention briefly in a second, has said to us in writing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe only (multipronged education strategies) seriously address the roots of racism and ignorance, whereas legislation addresses the symptoms.</PARA>
<PARA>The council has also said, and I quoted this yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the end, the bill becomes a token gesture, or what some proponents of the bill would call an educational tool. The most vilified groups&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and, of course, the Arab community is among the most vilified groups&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">prefer more substantial educational measures which permeate the most powerful institutions responsible for spreading misinformation which then creates fertile ground for racism.</PARA>
<PARA>So I just put that back on the record. In doing so, I also point out, as I did yesterday, that in writing to the coalition in response to our request for views on the government's bill, the Australian Arab Association wrote unequivocally, `We strenuously oppose this bill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also point out, and I mentioned it yesterday in my speech, that the Islamic Society of Victoria and some other Islamic representatives have also been critical of the legislation. I realise, of course, that not all members of the Arabic community are Islamic, although many Islamic persons are Arabic. There is a linkage there, and there is no doubt at all, on the advice that we have received, particularly from the Islamic Society of Victoria, that that organisation is opposed to the bill. I want to put that on the record without prolonging the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one point in what Senator Short said that I wish to advert to as I think it is quite important. It relates to the meeting of the national conference of FECCA in Hobart where representatives of the communities, on behalf of the communities, expressed support for the bill. In his speech Senator Short quoted communities, not private individuals. The question arises as to whether he has the authority of representatives of those communities to speak on behalf of the communities when he says that they have concerns about the bill. I believe it would be helpful if Senator Short could clarify that for the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, there are differing views in the Liberal Party as well&mdash;not just in the federal parliament, but elsewhere. Can I come in on this particular point? Senator Spindler, in respect of the Australian Arabic Council of Victoria, I also spoke to Roland Jabbour on Saturday morning when I launched their media awards and awarded the first one. He was concerned that their position was being misinterpreted. Their position, as has been expressed before the parliamentary committee, is one that supports the legislation, but he is concerned in fact about the extent of the exemptions. They said to me that the legislation is not strong enough because the exemptions will allow action to continue which in their mind should be attacked. I think the very solid point made to me on Saturday, which has been made to Dr Sumic and the department since, is that they believe in legislation. They also believe in education, but they believe in the need for both.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reply to two implications from Senator Spindler's remarks about the Greens' approach to this bill and the concern about the criminal sanctions. The first implication was that almost all so-called ethnic community groups wanted the criminal sanctions and wanted the bill in the form that the government was presenting it. I, and I am sure other senators, received boundless mail to let us know that was not a correct implication. I apologise to Senator Spindler if that is not what he meant. That is the underlying assumption that I derived from his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second implication was that the freedom of speech supporters had won. I want to rebut that, at least from my point of view. I want to quote a letter from the Executive Officer of the Social Responsibilities Commission of the Anglican Province of Western Australian in a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Church Scene</EMPHASIS>. Mr Hall said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is simply not correct to say this Bill enjoys widespread support in the Aboriginal and ethnic communities.</PARA>
<PARA>In parenthesis I should clarify that he was writing it in response to the Multicultural Affairs Commission, which he believes got it wrong with its enthusiastic support for the federal Attorney-General's Racial Hatred Bill. He goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best organised ethnic groups favour legislation because they are well resourced, enjoy networks and senior positions that allow them to take advantage of criminal legislation. However, the majority of groups who fall prey to racism and vilification are not so well organised. Former Race Relations Commissioner Irene Moss recognised this saying, "It seems, that those ethnic groups most in need of protection by this sort of legislation are least likely to use it." The two groups that experience racism the most in Australia are the first people here, the indigenous people, and the last people here; and the most recent arrivals always seem to just slot in above the first people here as far as racist discrimination and vilification goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A critical issue is the bill's criminal sanctions. It is important how we say no to racist violence and say yes to a more tolerant society. Racism and incitement to racist violence is totally unacceptable: however, making a criminal sanction or penalty for offences of this kind is not the best way to improve our society and promote tolerance and acceptance of all people. Criminal penalties do not change attitudes. What we want to see in Australia is a positive change of attitudes, hearts and minds; the threat of criminal sanctions will not be a deterrent, or a positive direction in which to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major concern is the exclusion clauses. These protect the powerful institutions, the people who fashioned dominant ideas and who have the power to construct racially discriminatory images. The media empires, Hollywood film companies and universities are safe to continue with impunity.</PARA>
<PARA>I gave that lengthy quote because the last section is also of relevance. It points out that the government's concern to protect any accusations of limitation of freedom of speech has actually offended another group in the community which believes that it will allow the operation of this bill to again discriminate in favour of those who are powerful and who have access to resources. It will perhaps make it more difficult for those who are less favoured in those aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make is that this is not only about the freedom of speech issue. That would have missed the point of most of my comments on this topic. In some correspondence to me, William J. Lines stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The laws do infringe freedom of speech and do introduce ideological bias into legislative statute but their most undesirable feature lies elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation designed to counter racial vilification will fail because the legislation itself fosters racialist thought. Although vilification legislation does not define race, it depends on the idea of race. Race is the legislation's central organising concept. Thus racial vilification laws do not serve so much to banish racism as to promulgate race. The law ought not to perpetuate such confused, dangerous, and gross falsehoods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Racial vilification laws are crude and self-defeating forms of developing compassion and of overcoming aversion for otherness. The state cannot mandate tolerance. The state can only sponsor conditions (a civil society) where learning and understanding can flourish. And learning and understanding, judging people by character, not by external appearances, are the only effective means of overcoming racism.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the central point. It is the reason why I have been very pleased to see that, with the assistance of the opposition's objection to the particular forms of criminal sanctions in this bill, they have been able to be struck out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that I do not have concerns about the civil remedies. The concern I wanted to raise was that, in the anxiety to allay any criticisms regarding the limitations of freedom of speech, the legislation may itself be slightly facilitating of some people's access to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on complaints. It may actually protect others&mdash;for example, the radio announcers and the politicians who are free to continue to make statements that could be interpreted as being racist in content and could cause offence. I will not continue any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe these sections of the bill that deal with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission clearly send a signal that racial vilification is unacceptable in this community. They offer redress for victims of oppression in that regard. While there may well be some kind of query about their constitutionality, I believe the bill is just sufficient to warrant the support of the Greens and, providing these criminal sanctions are not reintroduced at some later stage, I indicate that we will be supporting the bill. </PARA>

<PARA>This motion relates to the Queensland election and certain matters arising from that. It is a matter for any senator to speak in this debate but I indicate to the Senate that my Queensland colleagues Senator O'Chee and Senator MacGibbon&mdash;and, perhaps, others as well&mdash;will be speaking on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motion calls upon the Senate to note the result in the Queensland election and to note further the quite magnificent result by the coalition parties at the election. In that election, as my motion indicates, the Australian Labor Party government lost nine seats&mdash;four to the National Party and five to the Liberal Party. As a result of the election, the Labor Party now holds government by a slender thread of one seat. There is, of course, one Independent, Ms Liz Cunningham, the Mayor of Calliope&mdash;a good friend of mine but an independent person who was elected as an independent. She has done a quite magnificent job in the Calliope Shire. She defeated the sitting Labor Party member for Gladstone, a community that was once thought to be a pretty solid Labor community but is now held by Ms Cunningham as an Independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Congratulations must go to Joan Sheldon, the Liberal Party leader, and Rob Borbidge, the National Party leader, who did a magnificent job in running a campaign in the Queensland election. They confounded all the political experts in the way they conducted the campaign and in the success they achieved at that election. It is really a credit to them and to the Liberal Party and National Party organisations in the way that campaign was conducted. As a Liberal, I must place on record the magnificent effort of the Liberal Party organisation and that of Mr Bob Tucker, the state president, and Mr Jim Barron, the state director, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really was a result that was not predicted by most people. It was an election that saw quite dramatic swings against the Labor Party from the people of Queensland who were sick and tired of the arrogance of the state government, in the same manner as they are sick and tired of the arrogance of the Keating government operating out of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election is not yet over. As honourable senators will be aware, there has been an application made to the Supreme Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns in relation to the Townsville based electorate of Mundingburra which you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would be aware of, having your base in that town, as I do. Senators will be aware that the sitting Labor Party member, Mr Ken Davies, won that seat&mdash;or at the present time, has won that seat&mdash;by a mere 16 votes. There were a number of irregularities in that contest. It is for that reason that the Liberal Party has taken steps to overturn that particular result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will be aware that of 2,002 absentee voters, 347 were not allowed the vote they claimed. They were not allowed it because, according to the electoral office, their names did not appear on the electoral roll. Quite a number of them do not know why their names were removed. A number of them have rung my office and rung other Liberal Party people saying that they did not remove them; they were on the electoral roll last time. One wonders how their names came to be removed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry comes from the union movement. He would know that it has actually been proved that in the case of union elections this sort of thing goes on. I do not say Senator Sherry has been involved in those sorts of things, but he is a member of the union movement and everybody knows that the union movement controls and is one and the same body almost as the Australian Labor Party. So this paragraph in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> would perhaps have little bits of truth attached to it. So that is one of the grounds, but we will look into that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this newspaper article says, a number of people in the ALP in Townsville are a little concerned about what a proper audit might just bring up. In addition to that, when the marked roll is available we will check allegations of double voting and dead people voting. We will have a look at that. We also want to look at what happened to the 20 Australian troops out there serving their country who were denied a vote. I understand that Senator Ray has been asked by Senator Newman, the shadow defence minister, just what happened there. We have not been favoured with a reply yet, but it would be interesting to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to newspaper reports&mdash;the Townsville <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 27 July&mdash;20 troopers, 20 soldiers, who were serving their country in Rwanda and who were registered on the rolls in the Mundingburra electorate were denied a vote. I repeat the figures: there were 20 of them. The Labor Party won by 16 votes. Soldiers vote all over the shop, but it is pretty well-known that the bulk of votes from the military forces go to the Liberal and National parties.</PARA>

I am not saying that these 20 would have all voted for the Liberal candidate, but it is a pretty fair guess we would have got a majority of them. When you are only 16 in front and 20 have been denied a vote, it looks a bit suspicious. But let us look further. Mr O'Shea, the electoral officer, said that on 6 July the electoral commission had been notified that the troops in Rwanda had not received postal votes. That suggests that they must have asked for them before 6 July but they had not got them. That in itself is interesting. He then said that they were allowed to fax in an application for a postal vote. This arrived on 10 July. By 12 July, that is the previous Wednesday, the ballots were in the hands of the military.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I am sorry that Senator Sherry has put you in the position of having to make rulings like that. He should be chastised for disrupting the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish Senator Ray were here to answer this but Senator Ray is not here today. Do you know where Senator Ray is? He is up in Townsville greeting home those troops from Rwanda. He did not invite Senator Newman to go with him. Senator Ray has left parliament to go up and welcome the troops home from Rwanda. It is a pity he did not pay as much attention to allowing those troops their democratic right to have a vote in the state election. He did not seem to be too concerned about that. I say to you, Senator Sherry, that if Mr Keating had wanted to go to Rwanda I am quite sure the Australian military forces, the Australian defence forces, would have enabled Mr Keating to get there within one or two days at the very most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electoral commission gave those postal voting papers to the defence forces on Thursday, 12 July. I say to you, Senator Sherry, that had the defence forces, had Senator Ray, wanted those people to vote, do you know how he could have got them to vote? He could have got those votes over to Perth on any of the many commercial aircraft that fly to Perth every couple of hours every day of the week. Once they got to Perth they could have left Perth at 1.10 p.m. on Thursday, 13 July and they would have arrived in Harare in Zimbabwe at 6.20 p.m. on Thursday, 13 July. After that, it is a five-hour flight from Harare via Nairobi. My authority for this is Senator Herron, who went to Kigali via this very route. So they could have got to Kigali in a further five hours. Maybe that would have happened the next morning. You can get an Air Zimbabwe flight out of Harare to Nairobi. Senator Herron tells me they run every couple of hours. You then charter from Nairobi into Kigali. That takes a couple of hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if Senator Ray was at all interested in giving those troops their democratic right to vote, those votes could have been in Kigali on the Friday prior to the election, that is, the day before the election. The electoral rules state that as long as those troops voted by 6 p.m. on the Saturday their votes would count. Do you know what Senator Ray's office told us and told the Townsville <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> had happened? The defence forces sent those votes to Kigali, so they tell me, via Brussels. Why would you send them to Brussels when you can send them to Perth and straight across to Harare? But they went to Brussels. They say they tried very hard to get those votes from Brussels, would you believe, to Kigali but the plane they had them booked on was cancelled. What a pathetic excuse!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those soldiers who are doing their duty for Australia deserve to be entitled to vote. They were not entitled to vote. They missed out on their vote, those 20 soldiers, in an electorate that was won by the Labor Party by 16 votes. I do not cast any aspersions but I do say this: the defence forces and the electoral commission should have tried much harder to ensure that those soldiers who did want to vote were able to vote. They are some of the things that will be raised in the Court of Disputed Returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of irregularities in that election&mdash;people coming in saying they applied for absentee votes in other parts but were denied them. With an election that is so very close one would wonder why that sort of thing happened. So the election is not over yet. If the Supreme Court should decide that there were irregularities, that the election should not stand, and if the court should decide to give that to the Liberal candidate, then there could well be a change of government in Queensland. So the Queensland election is not yet over by any means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the matter that was raised quite a lot in the papers at the time of the poll. Mr Ken Davies, the successful Labor Party candidate, is, according to newspaper reports, being sued by the Commonwealth Bank for a large amount of money. The papers report that if Mr Davies is unable to pay those debts that the Commonwealth Bank says he owes them, he may he forced into bankruptcy. If he is forced into bankruptcy he would have to forfeit his seat in the Queensland parliament. So even if the Court of Disputed Returns application is not successful there may need to be a by-election in the seat of Mundingburra as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government is still the major shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank and we will be watching very closely to find out whether the Commonwealth Bank does pursue that action, those legal proceedings, brought against Mr Davies or whether somehow they just disappear off the face of the earth. I will be watching to make sure that no pressure is brought to bear on the Commonwealth Bank to settle some debts that are alleged to be owing in a way that is not proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know my colleagues want to speak on this. Whilst there is a lot more I would like to say, I will curtail myself. In concluding, though, I want to refer to the final paragraph of my motion that the Senate is debating. That asks the Senate to note that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ALP campaign for the State election included the now common tactic of the ALP of lies and deceit, as instanced by the disgraceful `hospital sold' postcard campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>That disgraceful and dishonest campaign by the Labor Party, by Mr Mike Kaiser, the ALP State Director, and by the Queensland Premier, Mr Wayne Goss, has been published and written about in almost every media. It was a silly stunt that backfired enormously; it was just dishonest. Nobody could produce a skerrick of evidence that that was ever proposed by the coalition or any member of it. It was a direct and outright lie, yet it was done in all the marginal seats throughout Queensland. These postcards came out with a photo of the local hospital on them and with a sign across them saying,`sold', and on the back it said, `This is what the coalition wants to do to your hospital'&mdash;just an outright and direct lie that has not in any way been refuted by any member of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are a lot of decent Labor Party people who were as disgusted with that tactic as most other Queenslanders were. But it is the sort of thing we have come to expect from the Labor Party these days. You just have to look at the New South Wales election. The New South Wales Labor Party quite clearly won that last state election on the basis of a promise to do away with tolls on roads. It is clearly said by a lot of the commentators that up to three seats went to the Labor Party as a bribe from that promise to do away with the toll roads. What happens? We find out a few months afterwards that Mr Carr, in the same mould as Mr Keating and Mr Goss, as soon as the election is over, as soon as they have won it, says, `I am sorry, we told a little fib about that. We are not going to do it.' And they expect the Australian people to wear that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell you this, Senator Sherry: the Australian people are sick and tired of the Labor Party and Labor Party leaders lying to them, and they will not wear it any more. I warn you that, as I go round Australia and round my state of Queensland, people tell me that they just do not believe any longer anything that Mr Keating says. It does not matter what he says in the future, people will not believe him&mdash;and neither should they. Despite all the fine words at the National Press Club today and this so-called new approach from Mr Keating, people do not believe him any more; and that will be quite clearly shown in the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude finally by pointing out yet again that in the Queensland election, as in so many others, the Liberal and National parties received 53.28 per cent of the vote and the Labor Party received 46.72 per cent of the vote&mdash;the same sort of thing happened in New South Wales&mdash;yet the Labor Party are in power. And one has to wonder about those sorts of things as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to congratulate the coalition on their very good showing in Queensland, especially the Liberal Party, which gained, I believe, five extra seats in the election. It certainly was a very good performance. I do not want to be too critical, but I guess I must ask what the coalition would have done if they had won government, because I am not sure they were expecting to. If they had won, perhaps they would not have been ready to take over the reins of government. That is a hypothetical question, and I need to get to the substance of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Senator Ian Macdonald in his motion points out the very curious result in terms of the final percentages on a two-party preferred basis. On that two-party preferred basis the ALP vote was 46.72 per cent compared with the coalition's combined vote of 53.28 per cent. I remember that for years we had debates about one-vote one-value, and certainly that result again raises that question. But I might point out that, in terms of longstanding Democrats policy, had Queensland been operating under a system of proportional representation with multi-member electorates, the coalition would be in government today in Queensland. I might also add that the Democrats would have won at least one seat in Queensland under proportional representation, with over 30 per cent in Springwood after distribution of preferences. It certainly does make one wonder about that longstanding policy which, we have always claimed, gives the fairest representation in parliaments if it is followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn now to part (d) of Senator Macdonald's motion, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ALP campaign for the State election included the now common tactic of the ALP of lies and deceit, as instanced by the disgraceful `hospital sold' postcard campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>Much as I abhor these kinds of tactics, I have to say that I think Senator Macdonald is right in this instance. There is a glaring need for reform in this area, not only in Queensland but in every state of this Commonwealth and certainly in federal elections&mdash;a glaring need for checks and balances on the substance and integrity of political claims made at election time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate would be aware that the Democrats have tried for some time to have amendments moved to various pieces of legislation which would bring truth in political advertising onto the statute book. In fact, only a week or so ago we had a forum at which representatives from all the political parties debated this very issue. We got, certainly from the coalition, a fairly firm commitment to move towards this kind of legislation, but the Labor Party felt that there were too many problems with it and, at least in Queensland, were not prepared to support legislation of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also need to say that in that election campaign it was not only the Queensland Labor Party which we would criticise. We would also want to criticise the coalition, and certainly Mick Veivers on the Gold Coast. He lowered himself, we believe, by distributing what we believe were mistruths and, in doing so, gave further reason for Queenslanders and Australians to mistrust politicians and their claims and, therefore, to lower the credibility of all of us. That is why the Democrats believe we must put an end in some way to these kinds of political campaigns. With each of the major parties telling fibs to the electorate, how can we ever restore the faith and trust which people ought to have in their political leaders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must return to the pamphlet put out by Mr Veivers on the Gold Coast. I found it incredibly offensive, and it misrepresented the position that the Democrats took on the issue which he was dealing with. The Labor Party will have to defend itself, but the claims he made about the Democrats were simply wrong. I noticed that the opposition leader, Rob Borbidge, following the election, demoted Mr Veivers from his former shadow tourism portfolio to a junior and less responsible portfolio. I suspect that Mr Borbidge saw fit to act upon the mistruths which Mr Veivers letterboxed across the 20,000-strong Southport electorate in the last 24 hours of his campaign, against, I understand, his leader's advice and the information provided to him by the Democrats that his claims were factually incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I could enlighten the Senate by mentioning a couple of the things that he said. He made this claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DID YOU KNOW THAT the Democrats have a Private Members Bill before Parliament to force all schools to teach our children homosexual practices?</PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely wrong&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DID YOU KNOW THAT Labor and the Democrats want to legalise homosexual marriage?</PARA>
<PARA>No, wrong again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DID YOU KNOW THAT Labor and the Democrats want to allow homosexual couples to adopt children?</PARA>
<PARA>If he is referring to Senator Spindler's bill, that bill refers to the current legislation on adoption and continues the wording of that legislation, `that the welfare of children will be paramount at all times'. Another claim in Mr Veivers's leaflet states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DID YOU KNOW THAT Labor and the Democrats plan homosexual Mardi Gras parades through the streets of Southport?&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything is up for sale when the Labor Party is in power. Not just real estate is up for sale. Under the state Labor government, principle has been up for sale as well. Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, I know that on a couple of occasions you have had disputes with the state Labor government on a number of issues to do with Aboriginals and the environment. I pay tribute to your courage and to the fact that you are willing to stand up for principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, many people in the state Labor Party in the parliament in Queensland are not willing to stand up for principle. That is why they did so badly at the election. I had person after person come up to me and say, `I have voted for Labor for 40 years. I am going to break the habit of a lifetime because I am never going to vote for these'&mdash;I will leave out the expletives&mdash;`people again.' They knew that the Labor Party in George Street which was in power in Queensland was going to sell them out. That is exactly what it did. It sold out the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ian Macdonald, where was one of the highest swings in Townsville against the Labor Party? Was it not in the railway estate? It used to be the bastion of the Labor Party. The swing was something like 20 per cent. The workers knew that the Labor Party had sold them out. They knew that their jobs were not safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the rhetoric that people opposite like to throw at Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the National Party, the Liberal Party and the coalition, the workers in Queensland in the railways knew that they had a secure job. With the Labor Party, all they know is that the story they get today might not be the truth tomorrow. That is why the ordinary workers voted heavily against the Labor Party. They saw that the Labor Party was increasingly pandering to minority groups who were not representative of the general community. Pandering to the minorities is the track record of the Labor Party in Canberra and in Brisbane. These are some of the reasons why the Labor Party did so badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are also some of the reasons why the Labor Party will lose the next federal election. It does not matter whether it is Bob Carr's Labor Party in New South Wales, Wayne Goss's Labor Party in Brisbane or Paul Keating's Labor Party in Canberra; you cannot trust what a Labor leader says to you. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a long running saga of deception on the part of the Labor Party. For example, in New South Wales, in the lead-up to the state election, there was a fulsome promise by the leader of the Labor Party that he would abolish the tollways. He came into power and waited a couple of weeks. His hands then went up in the air, and he said, `I am sorry. I just cannot keep that promise, but I will keep some others,' as though that would be an amelioration of the deception of the people. He said, `I cannot keep that promise, but I will try to keep some others.' That was the promise that got the Labor Party elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the Labor Party made numerous promises. I do not know if I want to indulge in bet taking in this chamber. If I were a betting man, I would bet that half the promises that the Labor Party made in the lead-up to the last state election will not be kept in Queensland, just as the promises made in the lead-up to the New South Wales state election are being broken right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where did they learn this tactic? They learned it from their great leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He is the man who promised tax cuts and then scrapped them. He is the man who promised to solve the current account crisis and who has found that it is worse now than it has ever been. He is the man who promised to solve Australia's savings problem and has presided over the decline of this nation's savings base from 15c in every post-tax dollar to 3c in every post-tax dollar. This is the track record of the Labor Party. It is nothing other than deception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that there was a reason why the Labor Party would not learn anything from the election. One reason why the Labor Party will not learn anything from the last state election in Queensland is the people they have at the top.

It was a fact then that the coalition in Queensland ran a health system that was not subsidised by Canberra and where the hospitals were free. People got treated quicker than they are now with money supposedly coming from Canberra. Why? Because when the coalition was running the hospitals in Queensland the money went to paying doctors and nurses, not paying bureaucrats to sit there and shuffle bits of paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Senator Sherry raised the issue of the health system in Queensland, it is interesting to note that, prior to the last election, the pathology lab at Cairns Base Hospital had windows that would not seal, had an air-conditioning system that did not work and had mushrooms growing in the ceiling. The only decent building for the health department in Far North Queensland was the regional headquarters down the street from the hospital where they had the nice shiny windows, the nice furniture and the nice computers, desks and telephones and they got paid to sit there and twiddle their fingers. The people who delivered the services were the ones who lost out. That is why everybody knows that the Labor Party cannot run the health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the last election, we even had the state Labor government trying to defend the health system. They sent the short lived Minister for Health, Mr Elder, up to Cairns to explain the situation. When caller after caller phoned the radio station and said, `I'm afraid it's not good enough; the queues in the public hospitals are dreadful' his response&mdash;and this is beautiful; Senator MacGibbon will appreciate this&mdash;was, `Of course you have to queue. The hospitals are free. After all, you have to queue for anything that is free.' That was his excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the people of Queensland are having to queue up for a metaphorical slap across the chops. They are getting abused by the Labor Party in every imaginable area of state government activity. The health system is an absolute disaster. The railway system is a shambles. The government is busy closing down the railways when what it ought to be doing is providing the infrastructure to open up Queensland. The state government has pulled all the people out of the courthouses. They have pulled out ambulance workers. They have pulled out dentists and doctors. They have pulled out policemen. They have pulled out nurses from regional Australia. Is it any wonder there was such an enormous backlash against the ALP?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Add to that the fact that the main preoccupation of the state Treasurer is to flog off his home town to foreign businessmen. Is it any surprise that people get a bit disappointed? But of course we know that what they did in Queensland is entirely consistent with the Labor Party's infatuation with foreign investors in Australia. We know that the Prime Minister of Australia hopped into bed with some foreign investors in a failed piggery venture&mdash;an absolute lamentable disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Baume has said in this chamber before, Mr Ole Jacobssen of Danpork is publicly saying that he regretted ever meeting the Prime Minister.

We had Mr Goss who was the most popular Labor figure in history&mdash;state and federal. He was Mr Seventy Per Cent. Everyone loved him. He was teflon suited and never put a foot wrong. We had a government which had a very strong majority in the parliament. There were no blemishes on their performance because they played a straight bat to everything. They undertook no social reforms and no economic reforms. Ultimately, the fact that they were a do nothing government was their undoing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their position was very strong. As all the polling showed, 75 per cent of Queenslanders&mdash;I even saw one figure of about 78 per cent&mdash;believed that the government would be returned. They had the resources of office which they, like the federal Labor government, used absolutely ruthlessly in pork-barrelling and in every other way to defend their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we went to the election and the result was that the Liberal Party came out with 14 seats and an increase of roughly three per cent on their first preference votes&mdash;and remember that under the coalition agreement they only contested about half the seats in the state. The National Party increased three seats to a figure of 29 seats and got roughly two per cent on their first preference votes, again they only contested about half the seats. The ALP lost nine seats and ended up with 45 seats, with one Independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator O'Chee have said, we have this appalling situation where the overwhelming majority of Queenslanders voted Labor out of office yet they are saddled now with a Labor government. It is not correct for Senator Jones to say, `That's too bad. We got the majority of seats even if you got the majority of votes.' It is even worse for him to say that all the electors wanted to do was give the government a slap over the wrist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In no sense is the landslide vote against the Labor Party a slap over the wrist. The Queensland people had had enough. They were fed up to the back teeth with the incompetence of the Labor government. They did what people in a democratic society do: they voted against them. They ended up only voting 46.2 per cent for the Labor Party versus 53.4 per cent for the coalition&mdash;and, because of the gerrymander, we lost. The point is that the immorality of it is something that the Labor Party will not face up to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average swing against the government and the swing to the Liberal and National parties was 7.2 per cent. That, in historic terms, is a landslide. It cannot be described in any other way. One of the earliest results to come up on the night in the polling room was the count for one of the strongest booths in the seat of Mr Burns, the Deputy Premier. His face nearly fell through the floor when the announcer said there had been an 18 per cent swing against Mr Burns in his safest booth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have campaigned many times in Wynnum and I do not think there is a Liberal or National Party vote there. I have been abused on street corners more times than I can count, but that will not stop me going back whenever the next election is called. It is tough country. Generation after generation there have voted Labor. The area from Cannon Hill through to Lytton and south of the mouth of the river, Murarrie, is as hard core Labor as you will get. In that area, 18 per cent of the Labor Party faithful walked away because of the intense disappointment the electors had with the lack of action by the Goss government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the seats where there was a Liberal-Labor contest, the swing averaged eight per cent. Where there was a National-Labor contest, the swing was almost the same, at six per cent. There was only one three-cornered contest in the state, and again that was bad news for the Labor Party because the Labor Party eternally tried to split the Liberal Party away from the National Party and focused a lot of emphasis and propaganda on the fact that it leads to friction between the two. But we did the Labor Party in the seat of Barron River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We gave the lie to the Labor assertion that a three-point contest leads to disharmony because there was not a cross word in that campaign. We took the seat from the Labor Party and the aggregate vote reflected a swing of nearly five per cent. There was no swing at all against Liberal candidates, and there was only a slight swing against some of the National Party candidates. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What went wrong? We have now, as Senator Ian Macdonald said, a Labor Party in power with a nominal one-seat majority. That one seat is the subject of a challenge before the Court of Disputed Returns. There are very serious concerns, and this is really at the heart of why this motion was raised this afternoon by Senator Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have grave concerns about what happened in the seat of Mundingburra. A large number of voters on the roll&mdash;namely, in excess of 100&mdash;are members of the Australian Defence Force who are overseas at the behest of their government on humanitarian purposes. For some inexplicable reason, the Department of Defence messed up the Queensland Electoral Commission's first-class polling arrangements. The commission complied to the letter and spirit of the law in every way; it was the Department of Defence&mdash;and we will be going into this in meticulous detail in due course at the estimates committee&mdash;which somehow or other messed up the delivery of the votes from the servicemen in Rwanda. The votes did not get back by 5 o'clock on the Tuesday or the Wednesday, 10 days after polling day. Therefore, they were declared invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You might ask, `What is 100 plus votes out of an electorate of 12,000 or 14,000&mdash;whatever Mundingburra is?' The relevance of it is that the vote in that seat was declared for the Labor Party on a margin of 16 votes. Anyone with any decency, anyone with any integrity at all, would have called for a re-election or a re-contest in that electorate, given the closeness of the votes and the disparity between the winning margin and the number of people who we can prove beyond any shadow of a doubt were denied their basic civil rights of voting in an election. That is why we are concerned. We have the Labor Party in power in that state, in effect, on 16 votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald has referred to the number of allegations in the community about phantom voters, double voters and people being denied access. I cannot comment on that. It is a matter for the courts to decide. I am quite sure those things must have some substance, they just do not come up out of the air. It is certainly not the Liberal Party which is complaining about being bad losers, we are just objectively and dispassionately stating the facts of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What went wrong? What went wrong from a Labor Party point of view is that they stopped listening to the community. They were far more concerned with the perks of office, the smell of the ministerial leather, the committee chairmanship and all the benefits that office brings for them, and protecting their position in those leather chairs against the incessant fratricidal combat between the factions in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everything. They were completely out of touch with the aspirations of the normal Queenslanders. Let us not buy any of this Labor propaganda that Queenslanders are conservative. Queensland is a very thoughtful state. It is full of electors who think about what they are doing and know what is going on. They do not want change that is irrational or capricious, but they do think about their politics quite a lot. I think they are better informed than any other state in Australia. They recognised that the Labor Party simply was not performing and they were going to change that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were aided in that wish for change by the people whom Senator O'Chee so aptly referred to as the boys in suits. The `boys in suits' is not a creation of Senator O'Chee; it is the public appellation given to the managing group in Queensland by the Labor Party itself. The Labor Party factions talk about the boys in suits. The chairman of the boys in suits is the redoubtable Mr Wayne Swan, the former state secretary of the ALP and now the member for Lilley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Swan has a very great reputation in Queensland because he is regarded as the mastermind who got Mr Goss into power after 32 years in the wilderness for the Labor Party. But what no-one in the Labor Party says is that the 1989 election that took the Labor Party into power in Queensland was an election that could have been won by blind Freddy or the drover's dog. It was quite impossible for the Liberal and National parties, in the wash-up after the Fitzgerald inquiry, to win that election. On that alone is Mr Swan's reputation based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Swan was aided by the two members of the committee. The first was the redoubtable Mike Kaiser, whom Senator O'Chee referred to so eloquently and with such affection; another apparatchik, a great numbers man and a great manipulator of the factions, but again totally out of touch with the Australian community and the Queensland community in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third member of the boys in suits is Mr Kevin Rudd who now aspires to be the member for Griffith in the next federal election. I have news for Mr Rudd. He need not be packing his bags to come down here. He wants to be looking for a billet somewhere in his old department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, because there will be no place for him down here come the general election. I cannot imagine anyone more out of touch with the community than that trio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have to take the blame because they ran the campaign for the Labor Party. They made these appalling errors of misjudging public taste and misjudging public tolerance. We had Mr Goss almost in tears in the debate with Mr Borbidge the day before the election when he confessed that the lying campaign over those postcards, which suggested that the Liberal and National parties were going to sell the state hospitals, had been a tragic mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all gets back to the boys in suits. It did not come from Mr Burns or Mr Goss; they would not have had the brains to think about that. It came from the boys in suits. They were a very, very great campaign asset for the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that the results demonstrated that the gerrymander is alive and well in Queensland. We have a situation where roughly 23 per cent of the vote went to the Liberal Party and it won 14 seats; the National Party won 29 seats on about 26 per cent of the vote; and on 46 per cent of the vote the Labor Party gained a majority of seats. The facts of life are that there is a persistent and longstanding gerrymander in Queensland that has survived over generations, and that gerrymander is delivered against the Liberal Party to confine it to a few seats in the capital city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is as strong today as it was in the days of Ned Hanlon, Vince Gair, and all the other apparatchiks of the Labor Party in the past. Until that is corrected it is going to be very difficult for us to win government in Queensland. But it will come in time because if the Labor Government sees its term out it will sink so heavily in public esteem that it will not get anywhere near a winning position in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to congratulate the management of both the Liberal Party and the National Party throughout the campaign. It was a very well coordinated and cooperative campaign. To Bob Tucker, the president of the Liberal Party, Don McDonald, the president of the National Party, Jim Barron and Graham Young of the Liberal Party, Ken Crooke and whoever in the National Party supported him, I offer my thanks and my respect for what was really a brilliant campaign.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased today to take this opportunity to look at the issues that have been canvassed and are raised by these particular papers that have been tabled in the Senate by the President. A code of conduct for parliamentarians is overdue. For too long we, as elected representatives, have allowed the sins of the few to undermine the public's trust and confidence in the integrity of the parliamentary institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that, at last, a parliamentary working group has drafted two important sets of principles; principles that set minimum standards of behaviour for members of parliament and for ministers and presiding officers. These principles do not, and cannot, prescribe or legislate for honesty or integrity, but send an important message to the people of Australia that we share their concerns about abuses of parliamentary standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of whether we should have a code of conduct goes back to April 1991 when the independent member, Ted Mack, asked the Prime Minister in question time whether he would initiate the development of such a code. The Prime Minister subsequently asked the presiding officers to establish a parliamentary working group, but the matter lay dormant until the Marshall Islands affair&mdash;involving former Senator Graham Richardson&mdash;broke in 1992. I am sure I do not have to remind the members of the Senate who were here in 1992 what happened at that particular time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the furore subsided and the matter stalled again. Then, in 1994, Ros Kelly hit the headlines over her administration of funds under the community, cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. The working group was, not surprisingly, reconvened and work on the codes began in earnest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I would like to say that public trust and confidence in the institution of parliament were restored. But how can we ignore the subsequent impact of revelations in Graham Richardson's book, or the controversies surrounding Alan Griffiths and Carmen Lawrence? It is fair to say that the parliamentary working group has an obligation to the public on behalf of the federal parliament, and for this reason draws its members from both houses and across the political spectrum. The members include a cabinet minister, Senator Robert Ray, his Labour colleague Jim McKiernan&mdash;a Western Australian who has taken a very close interest in the recent controversies in Western Australia and particularly those involving his colleague Dr Lawrence&mdash;Democrat Senator Vicki Bourne, Independent member Ted Mack, Green Senator Chamarette, as well as Liberal Party and National Party representatives, including myself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called codes of conduct are, in reality, two sets of principles. Firstly, there is a framework of ethical principles for ministers and presiding officers. This framework comprises nine principles, including: impartiality; honesty; the use of influence; gifts, benefits and hospitality; public property and services; and administrative accountability. The second set of principles consists of a framework for ethical principles for members and senators. This framework comprises eight principles, including: loyalty to the nation; integrity; and personal conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look for a few moments at the precedents. It is academic to ask whether the implementation of such codes of conduct would have prevented or limited the damage inflicted on the integrity of this parliament in recent years. But it is appropriate to put the code in a practical context. I turn to the so-called sandwich shop affair which involved then Minister Alan Griffiths and led to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) establishing an inquiry to examine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)whether there was any conflict between Mr Griffiths' private interests and the performance of his public duties; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) whether he authorised or condoned any inappropriate, improper or illegal activities by any of his staff in relation to the conduct of his private interests.</PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry found there had been no direct conflict or personal breach. But let me quote from its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been conduct on the part of Mr Griffiths which does not meet standards which might reasonably be expected of a Minister . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And in relation to three specific matters it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the inquiry finds errors of judgment and/or a want of diligence.</PARA>
<PARA>The report from which I was quoting was released just three weeks ago. As well as the Alan Griffiths affair, the report lists a who's who of Labor misadventures. There is Young in the Combe-Ivanov affair, Young in the Paddington Bear affair, Dawkins in his mother's shares affair, Young in the election donation affair, Richardson in the radio 2HD affair, Richardson in the Marshall Islands affair, Kelly in the sports program affair and Collins in the pay TV affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might remind Minister Collins of the Senate select committee's report into the pay TV affair, which called for `a form of guidelines against which a minister's exercise of responsibility can be assessed'. Well, those guidelines now exist on paper, and we are certainly looking at them today in these particular issues that are before us. The specific code for ministers and presiding officers reads, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers and the Presiding Officers are responsible for the competence with which they handle their public duties, the relevant actions of their personal staff and their departments, and their personal conduct insofar as it affects their public role.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to action taken by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, each House of the Parliament may consider matters raised by Members and Senators under this framework and a majority of two thirds of Members of a House will be necessary to resolve a matter.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth speculating on the controversy now involving Dr Carmen Lawrence and how she&mdash;and her fallible memory&mdash;would stack up against just two of the principles outlined by the parliamentary working group. Let me quote the first on honesty:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers and the Presiding Officers must be frank and honest in their public dealings and in particular must not mislead intentionally the Parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently by a Minister or Presiding Officer must be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>The second relates to use of influence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers and their Presiding Officers must not exercise the influence obtained from their public office to further their personal interests, obtain any improper advantage or benefit for themselves or another, or any promise of future advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, the controversy involving Dr Lawrence raises more questions than it answers. Surely she kept notes or a diary, particularly on matters of tactics; surely she knew the difference between right and wrong. Such speculation is all the more interesting given that Carmen Lawrence's own colleagues signed their names to the code of conduct&mdash;what we are looking at here today. She stands to be judged by them as well as by the people of Australia. Her honesty and integrity are very much on the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet Dr Lawrence has an overriding obligation to this parliament and to the people of Australia to stop indulging in political and legal gamesmanship and to finally lay the facts on the table. As a minister of the Crown, she has no alternative. If she is not to expose any further hypocrisy in the Labor Party, she needs to be reminded of these documents that have now been tabled both in the House of Representatives and here in the Senate. Dr Lawrence must read those documents very carefully because her colleagues&mdash;in particular Senator McKiernan, who is one of the authors, and her ministerial colleague, Senator Ray&mdash;have both signed off on them. I hope they will come in here today to speak on this document and remind Dr Lawrence that she has an obligation to abide by these documents or further expose a great deal of hypocrisy within the Labor Party. </PARA>

I will just read a couple of quotes from the draft proposal. I won't read the whole lot, but a couple of quotes are well worth it. It starts off:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Members of the Commonwealth Parliament are obliged to meet a number of ethical and administrative requirements in respect of their behaviour and personal interests.</PARA>
<PARA>That goes without saying, whether they have drawn up a proposal or not. Further down, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister enunciates standards and determines the penalty for any failings of Ministers, but it is to Parliament and, through it, the people, that Ministers and the Presiding Officers are accountable. Ministers and the Presiding Officers are responsible for the competence with which they handle their public duties, the relevant actions of their personal staff and their departments, and their personal conduct insofar as it affects their public role.</PARA>
<PARA>The last Prime Minister to adhere to these principles was Malcolm Fraser when he took no nonsense from any of his ministers whatsoever and sacked the ones that stepped out of line and transgressed these principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will repeat a couple of lines that I have just read out: `it is to Parliament and, through it, the people, that Ministers and the Presiding Officers are accountable'. So when ministers or presiding officers tell lies to the public&mdash;it does not matter about when they are to the parliament, because that can be dealt with by the parliament&mdash;it is obvious that they have to be made accountable. I am afraid that with this government we have seen example after example, with the l-a-w tax cuts and the Premier of New South Wales in recent weeks. I make the point that it is of the highest order that a framework like this has to be put together. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You may remember that, in the Fraser years, the fact that a member of staff did the wrong thing was not an excuse for ministers not to have to tender their resignations, because the minister is in charge of the whole department and is responsible for the department.

Her own colleague in the state, Mr Jim McGinty, has said that his recollection was that she knew all about it&mdash;but I will come back to the petition that went in front of parliament over there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal separately with the ways in which she has broken eight of those nine very important ethical principles. You have to put her actions right alongside these principles that have been set down. We will look at impartiality. It is now clear from the evidence given at the royal commission into the circumstances of the Easton tragedy that Carmen Lawrence, as Premier of WA, introduced the subject of the tabling in the state parliament of the petition supplied by Penny Easton's former husband. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That petition made false accusations about Richard Court, who is the current Premier of Western Australia. Dr Lawrence knew the date of the election and she knew that Labor was going to be rightfully thrown out of office in Western Australia because of what happened in WA Inc. and all that. So the only way the Labor Party could survive was to destroy Richard Court. What did she do? Instead of destroying Richard Court, she destroyed an innocent life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the false petition was put down on a Thursday evening in the upper house of Western Australia. There were accusations about Richard Court and, of course, there were accusations about Penny Easton. Richard Court was cleared on the Friday by the police investigation. They came out on the Friday and said that he was cleared of any imputations in that petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the Tuesday, Penny Easton was also cleared of any wrongdoing that she was accused of in that petition&mdash;that is, by some time on Tuesday morning. Unfortunately, Penny Easton took her own life some time on Monday evening. That is what happened with that petition. So on that document, Carmen Lawrence, the minister, was nowhere near impartial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence clearly wanted to counter the criticism and destroy Richard Court. Now I come to the point that Senator Tambling raised in an interjection. By putting the heat on Richard Court and Penny Easton, she thought she would take the heat off herself about the $5,000 she had accepted of taxpayers' money for travel which she never undertook. She banked the money and held it for 2 1/2 years. To a lot of people, $5,000 is a massive amount of money. To a lot of people, it is not a great amount of money. There are various degrees in between. In 2 1/2 years, you could file three tax returns but say that she filed two. I take it that she is not like Mr Keating and she does file her tax returns. If nothing else, her accountant would have asked, `Where has this $5,000 come from?' She kept it there 2 1/2 years before being investigated by the WA royal commission, which found her out and caused her to repay it. So she failed on the part of impartiality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. 2 is honesty. It was clearly dishonest of Carmen Lawrence to keep that $5,000 after she cancelled travel plans&mdash;totally dishonest. She could have repaid that money immediately. If nothing else, the first tax return after that occasion should have found the amount in her account. It is not a small amount. She went unpunished because a decision was taken by the police that it was not an illegal act. In my view, holding $5,000 of taxpayers' funds for 2 1/2 years in your own private bank account is on par with a recent federal pronouncement this week that $4,000 worth of sexual services for Graham Richardson could not be considered a bribe when it was paid by somebody else. I will not go into that any further. I think everyone knows about it. In Dr Lawrence's case, it is quite clear that she did not get $5,000 worth of services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will give you an example of the $5,000 that was kept for 2 1/2 years. Within the last two weeks, I had a constituent in my office who was charged with offences against the Social Security Act. She was a youngish woman with a child of four years, and she had been accepting cheques from Social Security for some time as a single mother whilst she was in a bad relationship. She has been charged with various offences because, with Social Security, each cheque that you get is one offence. She knew when she came to my office that she would go to gaol. It was an amount somewhat the same as this, around $5,000. She had come to my office for my help in convincing legal aid to have her represented in court, to put her side of the story and minimise the gaol sentence. The matter is still in front of the courts; it has been adjourned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, once this young woman broke away from the relationship, she secured a job, went to Social Security and said, `Look, I am coming clean, I have been accepting cheques.' Social Security charged her and she is facing gaol. She has already paid a fair amount of it back because she has been working for a while. Once she got some money together, she was ready to pay some back and at least make some arrangements. That was about the same as this amount of $5,000. She came clean and she was in much worse circumstances than Carmen Lawrence. Where is the justice in this world, where on the one hand you can have someone who got $5,000 and paid it back after 2 1/2 years and on the other hand you have a constituent like this?

So I believe she has failed that one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. 4 is gifts, benefits and hospitality. Once again, the $5,000 was a gift that she gave herself by applying for money with the stated intention that it was to be used for travel. She then did not conform to the applicable procedures by handing back the money when she cancelled the travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. 5 is public property and services. That would cover that $5,000-odd itself. No. 6 is official information. This is the only principle which I believe, on the information that I have and the current available information, that Carmen Lawrence has honoured. No. 7 is administrative accountability. She is accountable to nobody over that $5,000&mdash;not the parliament, not the public and not even the department of which she was the head. So I believe that was another failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. 8 is compliance by staff. The Easton royal commission has heard of the prior knowledge by the staff working for Carmen Lawrence of the infamous petition and of the intention to use it to damage Richard Court.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now list a few of the other members of the government and ministers who have failed in their obligations under No. 3, use of influence. Senator Tambling, I think, mentioned former minister Graham Richardson using his influence in the Marshall Islands affair, which caused his eventual downfall. That is a principle that he broke; and it is something that he stood up time and time again about. He rang the President of the Marshall Islands and used the excuse that he was working for his brother-in-law, cousin&mdash;or whoever he was&mdash;just as a friend. Can you imagine then getting through to the President of the Marshall Islands as a `John Citizen'&mdash;not using his influence as a minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Gareth Evans defend him in this chamber. I have called it the Gareth Evans defence ever since then. He stood up and defended Richardson on that basis. Senator Evans used the example that if he was going to his daughter's school to see the principal, he would be there only as Gareth Evans, not Senator Gareth Evans, Minister for Foreign Affairs. I would say that if he went to see the principal he would be right up at the front of the queue, rather than just having to wait his turn like anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this government has made a full mockery of these nine principles. I go to No. 7 again, administrative accountability. Ms Kelly, the former minister for sport and recreation, was really brought to task. That saw the end of her. Senator Campbell did a lot of good work on that one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last principle I would like to mention again is continuing obligation.

I say at the beginning that one of the harsh realities one learns from being in this place is that you cannot legislate for honesty. You cannot impose integrity on people who have no integrity. No matter what rules, requirements and measures are introduced to enforce integrity and honesty, unless there is a capacity for people to be willing to accept those rules, to abide by them and not to spend their time trying to get around them, it is almost irrelevant what kind of facade is presented to give the appearance that all is kept above board in this or any other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my earnest hope that these proposals work, because there is no doubt that people of Australia have a very low opinion of their politicians. This is largely the result of one area which is not covered in this matter; that is, the persistent behaviour of politicians telling lies to the public of Australia at election time, of promising things that politicians know they cannot deliver, of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying he was opposed to these dreadful consumption taxes and then increasing his KST&mdash;Keating sales tax&mdash;by 50 per cent since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an increase in sales tax on motor vehicles alone by 46 per cent since the last election. So the hundreds of thousands of Australians who will have to renew their motor vehicles within the next year or so are going to find an increased cost, as a direct result of Keating's sales tax, of between $1,000 and $3,000 per vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder the politicians of Australia are held in such low repute. Who in New South Wales would take any notice of any promise by Mr Carr, the state Premier, having won his election on the basis of a solemn undertaking, of two or three years standing, to remove the tolls on the roads leading to the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney, the areas where the battlers live, where the workers of New South Wales are heavily concentrated?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He won two seats in those areas, which gave him government, and he won them by deceit. They are the areas of integrity and honesty that these proposals cannot and do not touch.

We do not like these people.' Hopefully at the next election they will not vote for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly disheartening, I suppose, to many of us on our side of politics, having been involved in telling the people honestly and up-front what we planned at the last election to do. Some people did not like it and, having been honest, we got beaten. There is a price, apparently, for honesty and that is defeat. There is a reward for deception and it is being in the Keating government; the Labor Party being in power. It is against that background that we have to see to what extent this draft proposal of a framework of ethical principles may increase the status and standing of parliament in the eyes of the public and, perhaps even more important, increase the capacity of the parliament itself to perform better than it has. These are the things we should consider when we look at this framework of ethical principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt there are many matters to which we can look to see where there have been failures along these lines. There are many matters in this area where clear failures to behave according to basic questions of integrity have marred, have limited, have affected, the capacity of this place to behave and to perform effectively. I am not going to go through the great list of misbehaviour by ministers of this government or, should I say, ex-ministers of this government mainly&mdash;although there are still some around who, having managed to blame their staff for their extraordinary activities are still there, despite a matter that I will deal with later where they are to be responsible for the actions of their staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the ideal situation, at least as seen by those who have prepared the framework for ministers and presiding officers. It says in this document that all members of parliament are obliged to meet a number of ethical and administrative requirements in respect of their behaviour and personal interests. A fundamental obligation in respect of ethical behaviour is to comply with the framework of ethical principles for members and senators. The word `comply' is particularly important. We have to see when we are looking at establishing new clear guidelines to what extent there has been a willingness to comply with the existing arrangements. This is of particular significance at the very top of the tree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the proposition that the code of conduct on public duty and private interests recommended by the Bowen committee is accepted as the model for general application, declaration of interests dealing with lobbying, hospitality, benefits and gifts that are the subject of procedures laid down by successive governments. In general that is outstanding and sound. It seems to be directed at the small change and not the big bikkies, judging by the way people in the Labor government come into this place with very little, struggle to bring up their families on parliamentary salaries and then magically become extraordinarily rich. That certainly raises questions about what happens to big bikkies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document goes on to say that guidance to ministers on administrative procedures and requirements pertaining to cabinet are provided in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS>. It says that the Prime Minister enunciates standards and determines the penalty for any failings of ministers. That is all very well; we have a situation where there are requirements and they have to be complied with. As I said, this word `comply' is very important. But when you start at the top, isn't that where you should be looking for guidance for the establishment of the right sorts of procedures and for the sort of behaviour that is ethical?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you start at the top in this place you start at the Prime Minister. But the Prime Minister did not comply with the requirements of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS>. Let me tell you that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS> in 1991 required the then Treasurer, Mr Paul Keating, to reveal to his then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, the fact that he had invested $430,000&mdash;goodness knows where he got it from when he was bringing up a family on a parliamentary salary&mdash;in a piggery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was obliged to reveal all details of any changes in his assets or liability situation to his Prime Minister. He failed to do so. At no stage did he ever advise his Prime Minister at the time&mdash;this is in the middle of May 1991&mdash;that he had acquired this half interest in a piggery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might say, `Oh, well, that doesn't matter because three weeks later he resigned as Treasurer.' The fact is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS> requires that information to be provided to the Prime Minister immediately&mdash;immediately! There can be no rationalising the then federal Treasurer's failure to abide by the rules, to comply with the framework of ethical principles of members and senators. And when you do not find the Prime Minister complying with the basic rules that already exist, how can you expect his ministers to have any greater regard for decency, honesty and integrity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of what members of parliament, let alone ministers, do, no doubt there is a set of rules about their advising parliament of their interests. So isn't it intriguing, when you look at what the man who had been the Treasurer did. He went on to the back bench for a while to work out how to dispose of his Prime Minister and replace him, and while he was there he revealed some of the details of the transaction that he failed to report to his Prime Minister, in breach of the rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But how did he go about reporting it to the parliament? Mr Keating told the parliament that he had acquired an interest in a company that had an interest in a piggery. Of course, the facts are that he acquired a half ownership of a company that entirely owned a piggery. He was simply misleading the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But according to Mr Keating and his mates that is quite acceptable. You can quite clearly misled the parliament by saying you only had an interest in a company when you half owned it and that that company only had an interest in a piggery when it entirely owned it. You can get away with that, apparently, because that is the way the rules can be interpreted if you are of such a mind&mdash;that's the important point. If you do not have the basic integrity to meet the requirements fully and honestly, then, quite frankly, the experience we have with this situation is that it almost doesn't matter what the rules say, you will have people who are prepared to do what they can to get around them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this question of accountability and the question of to what extent this is being led from the top. And I must say that under this present government I have no confidence that any of these recommendations will lead to any improvement from the government and ministers in particular&mdash;I exclude presiding officers from this consideration at this stage. I have no confidence in these ethical standards improving the behaviour of ministers while we have this kind of example continuing from the top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a question of Mr Keating having misled the parliament when he acquired control of his piggery group, but when he disposed of it only recently we had the same sort of problem. The Prime Minister himself who enunciates standards and determines the penalty for any failings of ministers has no-one enunciating standards for him and determining what penalties for any of his failings should exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of that kind of external control there is clearly a total absence of self-control. When the Prime Minister disposed of his piggery group it is now evident from documents filed in current legal actions in which the Indonesian buyers sought to have the piggery group wound up because of the extraordinary situation they found after they had acquired Mr Keating's half interest, that Mr Keating's half interest was subject to a memorandum of understanding for sale to Indonesians three days before Mr Keating announced in parliament that he had disposed of this interest not to Indonesians but, allegedly, to his piggery partner, Mr Constantanidis. Yet this was three days after a memorandum of understanding had been signed for Indonesian interests to acquire these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would this facade, this farce, be done? Was it to avoid one of the principles stated here about the potential for conflict of interest&mdash;the conflict between private interest and public duty? Let's face it, had that sale been direct from Mr Keating, and evidently direct from Mr Keating to the Indonesian interests, Mr Keating and the Indonesian interests would have had to get Foreign Investment Review Board approval for that sale to be effected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the Prime Minister would have had to ask his Treasurer to approve of a deal that would double the Prime Minister's money at least on his investment. All we do know from these documents is that for his $430,000 investment he got a return of about $850,000, even though the company had been losing massive amounts of money during his period as a half-owner and despite the fact that the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;the people's bank, the government bank, the bank that Mr Keating was the head of in political terms in this place&mdash;made a provision for bad debts of $4 1/2 million which the bank sought to keep from the public, to hide from the public by taking out an injunction against the Channel Ten television station in Sydney when it sought to reveal that fact the day before the last election in March 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about the facts&mdash;the bank wanted the figures hidden. The simple fact is this: Mr Keating would have had to make public, had he revealed that he had sold the shares to Indonesians, that he was to get a benefit as a result of a government decision, which was an FIRB decision. There was the potential for a conflict of interest&mdash;the very sort of ethical issue raised in this framework that we are now dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying to this chamber is this: it is so easy for people of a mind who wish to get around the rules to do so. In this case, Mr Keating purported to sell his interests to his piggery partner, who then magically a couple of days later on-sold it to Indonesians, when in fact the transaction was patently a direct matter where Mr Keating's interests were bought by Indonesians, as is evident from the draft memorandum of understanding of three days before Mr Keating's disposal of those shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Keating agreed to dispose of his shares and when the Indonesians agreed to buy them, that memorandum of understanding three days before the sale took place indicated that there was a repurchase option&mdash;it was a repurchase option not just a purchase option. Obviously you cannot repurchase something unless you have sold it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only person who was in that case eligible to exercise that option was Mr Keating, but he was not named in the option. The option was that an unnamed person was to be nominated either by Mr Constantinidis&mdash;Mr Keating's piggery partner, who I might say has managed to breach something like five different statutes, both state and federal, while running Mr Keating's piggery&mdash;or, failing him, by Mr Coudounaris, who just happens to be not only Mr Keating's solicitor but the secretary of Mr Keating's family company. Isn't it remarkable that this unnamed person was to have a repurchase option when the only person who had sold anything, as I have said, was Mr Keating? He therefore was the only person eligible to repurchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted with amusement that, when the final document was eventually signed on 17 March, `repurchase option' had been altered to `purchase option'. Obviously, when the solicitors looked at it in greater detail, they realised that the word `repurchase' in the draft gave the whole game away. At no stage has Mr Keating ever responded to the repeated requests that I have made here, and I do not know whether the press gallery has had the intestinal fortitude to ask Mr Keating about this matter. At no stage has he ever deigned to indicate whether he is the unnamed person who has the repurchase option&mdash;he has never denied it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this is of significance is that an option to purchase is an interest within the meaning of the word `interest' as far as declarations of interest for parliamentarians go. Yet there is no such declaration of interest, and no indication that he may well have access to such a repurchase option in his declarations of interest to this parliament. As I said, he did not tell Mr Hawke what he was obliged to tell him. He did not tell the parliament in an honest, full and proper way what he was supposed to tell the parliament when he bought his half interest in this disastrous piggery. He did not tell the parliament. He did not abide by the rules. He certainly did not abide by the principles when he disposed of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns are clearly these: if we have this willingness and enthusiasm to breach ethical standards from the very top of this government, how can we expect ministers like former Minister Kelly, for example, to stick by any standards that are acceptable? I suppose it is unfortunate for her that, considering the way she misled the parliament by saying that all these sports rorts payments had fitted into the criteria when they had not, she got caught out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, she could have got away&mdash;as Senator Richardson, who initiated this procedure, had got away with it for years&mdash;with quite improperly handing out many millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to marginal seats irrespective of whether the proposals for facilities were appropriate or in their best interests or would have served Australia best. They went to marginal seats. This massive, multi-million dollar rort could have gone on. It only ended because&mdash;I am grateful to him&mdash;the Auditor-General took up the concerns that I and some others, particularly Senator Campbell, had expressed about this sort of thing in Senate estimates for something like four years. They kept getting away with it for four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know to what extent we would look at this guideline, which says that ministers should not do things that bring particular benefits. I will read it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers . . . must not exercise the influence obtained from their public office to further their personal interests.</PARA>
<PARA>We have already dealt with that with the piggery. It is curious to note that the Danish people involved in the piggery joint venture only really wanted to get involved and only signed the deal ultimately after Mr Keating had become Prime Minister in April 1992. They obviously took the view that there was some political benefit in doing a deal with a company half owned by the Prime Minister. They had not signed it when he was a backbencher. But doing a deal with the Prime Minister obviously has some `benefits'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of great concern is that Mr Keating, having paid $430,000 for his half interest before the Danes had signed their joint venture deal, could then double his money after the Danes had signed the joint venture deal. They only signed that joint venture deal after Mr Keating became Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing else was going favourably for the company. It was losing millions. There is the potential for a conflict of interests in the sense that Mr Keating's personal interests were served by his company signing a joint venture deal with the Danes after he became Prime Minister. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers . . . must not . . . obtain any improper advantage or benefit for themselves or another, or any promise of future advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>I should perhaps move away from the Prime Minister because he is not the only minister who is interested in providing advantage. For example, I sought to move from my Wollongong electorate office after my lease had expired to the Camden/Narellan area in New South Wales for some very good personal reasons. For example, having a house there is a pretty good reason, apart from the fact that my wife and her children and grandchildren live in that region. I was banned from moving there, despite the Department of Administrative Services supporting and recommending the move, because the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Frank Walker, did not want me to have my office in a Labor marginal seat. He was seeking a direct political benefit by ignoring the recommendations of his department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of unethical situation that exists in this government. I have been forced to move into Sydney at a nominal rent&mdash;something like three times the size what it would have cost to be in the Camden/Narellan area. I might say how gratifying it is in the circumstances that the Labor man the minister was trying to protect has lost his preselection. Here we have a situation where you cannot, as I said, legislate for honesty. If you have a government made up of ministers who have no concern for basic integrity, there is nothing in this framework which will force them to have it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to raise a matter of concern to me in relation to two speeches by Senator Ian Macdonald in the Senate on 18 November 1993 and 28 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to seek redress under the Resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 relating to the protection of persons referred to in the Senate (Privilege Resolution 5).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I apologise for not submitting a response earlier but I was not aware that I could do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concerns relate to references by the Senator to the dismissal of the Shire Clerk of the Whitsunday Shire Council in Queensland. The Senator revealed the content of affidavits that are still in the jurisdiction of the courts. The affidavits referred to were filed in the Supreme Court relating to reasons why four councillors moved to terminate my position. The hearing is still pending. The purpose of the court hearing was to determine whether or not my position was terminated for being a "whistleblower".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following is a brief history of events which are pertinent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.I was appointed by the Whitsunday Shire Council as Shire Clerk in September 1992, commencing duties on 16 November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.I was selected from 45 other applicants for the position and I was the only woman applicant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.I am a qualified Municipal Clerk and have been since 1971. I hold the Clerk's Certificate for Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. I am a member of the Institute of Municipal Management, member of the International City Managers Association and hold a Continuing Programme Development Certificate. I have been awarded by the Institute of Municipal Management two overseas study fellowships; one was to study office automation extensively throughout the USA and the other was to study occupational health and safety legislation throughout Australia and New Zealand. I have also studied garbage disposal throughout China with the Australia China Foundation Society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.I have held various positions in Local Government since 1971: Chief Administrative Officer, City Accountant for 7 years, Deputy Town Clerk for a period over 11 years; assisted the Chairman of the Local Government Commission in Melbourne in relation to research into feasibility studies of amalgamation proposals of councils, and more recently Shire Clerk and Chief Executive Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My principal employers have been the City of Collingwood in Victoria&mdash;17 years, the Local Government Commission, Victoria&mdash;4 years, the Shire of Narrabri, New South Wales&mdash;approximately 2 years, and the Whitsunday Shire Council from November 1992 to the present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above is a list of all my employers since commencing my career in local government. My position has never been terminated prior to 12 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A brief account of events between 1992 and the present will I believe assist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shortly after commencing with the Whitsunday Shire Council I was required to investigate the disappearance of the pecuniary interest register. This investigation included internal investigations and led to police investigations culminating in my alerting the Criminal Justice Commission in my capacity as Shire Clerk. Whilst this matter was ultimately resolved it precipitated the beginning of political, administrative and internal problems which have plagued me ever since.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been ongoing and continuing contact with the Criminal Justice Commission (C.J.C.) over a number of matters during my period of employment. The matters which were reported to the C.J.C. all related to pecuniary interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The series of events mentioned above culminated in four councillors moving to terminate my position on 12 July 1993. What followed was industrial action, intervention by the Criminal Justice Commission, Minister for Local Government, the Attorney-General and other legal intervention which is still ongoing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.On 18 November 1993 Senator Ian Macdonald said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The council voted, for reasons I will not go into, to dismiss the shire clerk because members of the council were not able to work with her, and for other reasons". (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, p. 3121)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This comment is damaging to my reputation. This is particularly so when it is read in the context of the speech as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.On 28 June 1994 Senator Ian Macdonald again referred to the matter (Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, pp. 2186-2188).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that the Senator's version of the circumstances is an accurate reflection of the situation. The revealing of the content of the affidavits by my opponents prior to the court hearing has been damaging to me personally and professionally. It has been an attempt to prejudice my position but it does not reflect the extraordinary circumstances that existed at work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The speech on 28 June 1994 has given an opportunity for a local paper to publish the transcript verbatim from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It took two full pages on 6 July 1994, all page 1 and 3. There was also a front page Editorial on 13 July 1994. This exercise is particularly interesting when it is known that one of the persons who gave an affidavit along the lines mentioned was the Editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whitsunday Times</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allegations against me are without basis in fact. The publication of the material has had direct detrimental impact on me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By making the affidavits of my opponents public it has no doubt affected the public perception of my professional credibility and has done irreparable damage to my future career in local government or indeed any future employment prospects I may have had. The affidavits referred to portray a completely different situation to that which pertained at work, the seniority of my position and the extent and degree of my responsibility as the Shire Clerk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have high moral expectations and am an extremely hard working individual. I find the insinuations totally offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Ian Macdonald's remarks in relation to my general competence and unwanted sexual advances were completely unnecessary and unwarranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comment "dispute between elected councillors and the Shire Clerk" implies that there was a problem between "all" councillors and the Shire Clerk. This statement is not true. The Shire Clerk had the support of 5 of 9 councillors and all indoor and outdoor employees, as well as a good part of the community. This was witnessed by "all" employees going on strike etc. Therefore, reference to the "council" when the council was so divided is misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference to the campaign of smear and innuendo is exactly what these ex-councillors are doing to me . . . the opportunity that Senator Ian Macdonald has given these persons by revealing their affidavits in the Senate pre-empts the decision of the court. Indeed even though the court may find in my favour the adverse, negative publicity has irrevocably damaged my credibility, and caused exceptional private hardship financially, emotionally, physically and socially. The statements by Senator Ian Macdonald are incorrect and the publication of his speech in the local paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whitsunday Times</EMPHASIS>, is damaging to my proven reputation as an honest and hard working person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the period March 1994 to May 1994 negotiations between council and my solicitors continued in relation to settling outstanding matters. The transcript of the Senator's speech in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whitsunday Times</EMPHASIS> inflamed the situation, new councillors were embarrassed, it tarnished their view and alienated them in some way which was apparent in the manner some of them spoke to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In carrying out my duties I did no more or less than any other person in my position was required to do according to law. It is my impression that one reason I was appointed was because certain councillors felt that they could "bully" me to be a "rubber stamp" rather than what was required from a professional Shire Clerk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summing up, Senator Ian Macdonald has no personal knowledge of this council's procedures or operations. He does not know me personally, nor has he had discussions with me. He has no direct knowledge of my performance as Shire Clerk. He has relied on biased opinion and secondhand information. No attempt has been made to substantiate the allegations levelled against me mainly by former councillors who were subsequently not elected at the last council elections held in March 1994.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to discuss the government response which is before us. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquired into both the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 and the Family Law Reform Bill (No. 2) 1994, which was an exposure draft. Senators may recall that the committee delivered a report on that legislation. As a result of that report there were further requests from the community at large to have further input into those two pieces of proposed legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee quite properly considered that further hearings ought to be held. It is quite clear that in the community at large the question of family law legislation and proposed changes to it are of vital interest and concern to people. At the end of the day, the legislation deals with the very fabric of our society&mdash;that is, the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considered a number of proposals. For those who might be interested, I refer to the second report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee at pages 14 and 15 where there is a summary of the evidence in relation to the question of whether grandparents' interests ought to be specially recognised in the Family Law Act. It is to that matter that I will address my remarks this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee had the pleasure of hearing from Mr Robert Payne, Vice-President of the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia, and Mr Brian Lane of the Grandparent Action Group of Western Australia. I believe those two gentlemen put to the committee a very cogent argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting with Mrs Di Underwood and other members of a grandparents action group based in the eastern states who had a similar point of view. I am pleased to say that in conclusion&mdash;and this is shown on page 20 of the report at recommendation 1&mdash;the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the specification of grandparents be considered as an amendment to section 69C of the Family Law Reform Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>That recommendation was signed off by the chair of the committee, Labor senator, Barney Cooney. In fact, there was unanimous support from the Labor, Democrat, Liberal and  National Party senators for that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government response of June 1995 quite frankly astounds me and a number of other people. The government response stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee has asked the Government to give consideration to the specification of grandparents in the Family Law Act, in particular in proposed section 69C.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that more should be done to encourage separating parents to consider the beneficial role that grandparents may play, and will address this issue in the educational campaign accompanying the reforms contained in the Bill. While recognising the valuable role that grandparents may play, the Government believes that this legislation needs to present a proper balance, consistent with the theme of the child's best interests, and not unduly limit the Court's consideration of the best interests of the child in an individual case. The Government is concerned that an amendment to the proposed section 69C might detract from that fundamental theme.</PARA>
<PARA>The government agrees that more ought be done in recognising the very important role that grandparents play when families, unfortunately, disintegrate. Often, the children of those relationships do seek solace and guidance from the grandparents involved. Grandparents today are playing a greater role within the community and with the assisting of bringing up young children where there has been dislocation in the family due to separation between the partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a committee saw the cogency of the argument of simply inserting the word `grandparents' in the new proposed section 69C. That would have put the word `grandparents' simply in front of the term `other persons'. It would not in fact change the law in any substantive way but would give recognition and consideration to the very real role that grandparents play within the community and in assisting children when they are unfortunately dislocated by family break-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response of the government is, quite frankly, unbelievable. It is the sort of stuff that Sir Humphrey Appleby would be very proud of. Whilst accepting everything that is said about the role of grandparents and the importance of the role they play, they somehow come to a conclusion completely divorced from the facts and completely divorced from the evidence that was before our committee. Indeed, there is in fact nothing that would detract from the fundamental theme that the best interests of the child ought be looked after by recognising the very important role that grandparents play. I unashamedly support the proposal of the Grandparents Action Group of Western Australia and of New South Wales and the number of other groups that have been established around Australia in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us would be aware through our electoral offices of unfortunate situations where, because of family dislocation, grandparents have been dealt out of care for the children that are the subject of Family Court proceedings. Having been, and still being in fact, a practitioner in the area of family law, I suppose I have a greater understanding of that than I would gain simply through my electoral office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role that grandparents play is one that ought be recognised, fostered and supported by anybody who really and genuinely has the best interests of children at heart. For the government to say that somehow by recognising the role of grandparents you diminish the importance of the best interests of the child is really to engage in bureaucratic mumbo jumbo which is based on the view that it is too hard to amend the legislation or they are not really bothered with it. It is a very simple amendment which will not change the substantive law but give legislative recognition to the important role of grandparents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am genuinely disappointed in the way the government has approached this matter. To say that they will address it through the education campaign under the legislation is, with respect, to not deal with the issue as it ought be dealt with. We so often hear from the government that legislation is not only about the cold law but also very important for educative purposes, that legislation and the words in legislation play an important role in educating the community. To a certain extent, I agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if that is the government view, why are they not willing to recognise the role of grandparents in educating the community as well? When men and women separate, they should give consideration to the role of grandparents who are often the mainstay and the anchor sheet for the young children who suffer the unfortunate consequences of family separation. I would urgently ask the government to reconsider its approach to this matter on behalf of the hundreds, if not thousands, of grandparents around Australia who are very genuinely disappointed by its stance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report from the Senate Economics References Committee deals with a most important matter&mdash;that is, the tax treatment of small business. It is widely acknowledged that the role of small business in Australia is probably far more important than in any other industrialised or developed country in the world. Australian small business is by far the greatest employer and contributes far more to the economy than, to my knowledge, in any other country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the statistics, as I understand it&mdash;and depending on your definition of small business&mdash;it accounts for about 96 per cent of all businesses in Australia and employs about 3 million out of the 5.5 million people employed in the private sector. Of those enterprises, about 74 per cent employ fewer than five people. As we can see, it provides employment to millions of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to research prepared for the industry task force, small firms in Australia have been the source of almost all private sector employment growth since 1991. So when the government boasts of the enormous increases in employment, which have still left a horrendous level of unemployment, we see that it is basically in small business. The task force predicted that most new jobs created in Australia up to the year 2000 will be generated by small to medium enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this report notes, with unemployment still a major problem facing the Australian community, support for the important small to medium enterprises sector takes on added meaning, especially because of the potential for them to become increasingly important contributors to Australia's expanding export base. It is worth noting that the other fact that emerges from this situation is that small business is the most vulnerable in Australia not only to economic swings and roundabouts but also to offensive, intrusive and damaging government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to depend on small business for increasing employment, this report shows how vulnerable the prospect of increasing jobs growth and reducing unemployment really is. I think this report is of particular significance because it deals with some of the problems that still exist and which I believe must be corrected, if we are to have healthy growth in small business bringing with it healthy growth in employment. It is stated on page 3 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.8<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Economics Committee found during the course of its inquiry into the tax treatment of small business that although the implementations of some of the recommendations of the Beddall Committee report had been of considerable benefit to the small business community, some of the taxation problems encountered by small business remained essentially unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA>Also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report attempts to address these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>And I support the report in so doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main matter that I want to raise&mdash;and other senators may wish to raise other elements of it&mdash;is the cost of compliance. I know many people complain about the individual taxes themselves&mdash;and, heaven knows, there are enough of them. Here are just a few of those affecting small businesses: provisional tax, wholesale sales tax, pay as you earn tax, fringe benefit tax, prescribed payments system, capital gains tax, company tax, and superannuation guarantee. They are just the federal taxes, quite apart from all the state taxes that then hit small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where all small businesses in Australia must comply with at least one, and frequently several, of these taxes, the report says. As the following chapters in this report illustrate, none of these taxes in themselves are simple; and when three or four different taxes apply to the one business, compliance may become a considerable burden on the operation of that business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question of compliance seems to me to be central: the cost of compliance. I am strongly of the view that, when we have a decent government in this country, that government will have an inquiry into this whole question of the cost of compliance with governmental taxes, governmental regulations, and so on. We are getting to a situation now where the costs of compliance are strangling the small business end of Australian enterprise&mdash;and that, as we have noted, is the end where we can hope for and look for the greatest economic growth and the greatest job growth. We have to act to get rid of some of these absurd costs of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years we have seen the taxation act&mdash;under this government, which promised to simplify it&mdash;increase from 1,130 pages to 3,370 pages. We have also seen a whole range of activities where the costs of management on the government side may well have been kept small, but the costs of compliance by business have massively increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, a recent study undertaken by a reputable accounting organisation showed that, for the average small business, the cost of compliance with one tax alone, sales tax&mdash;the Keating sales tax, the KST: the consumption tax you have when you have a Prime Minister who pretends he does not support consumption taxes&mdash;is something like 25 per cent of the total tax collected. That is the impact it has on the average small business, according to this very reputable study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this report notes, a number of people making submissions to the inquiry were unhappy with the requirement that sales tax payers act as unpaid tax collectors. The Beddall committee, in fact, recommended that some kind of offsetting benefit be provided to small business because they do not have the economies of scale involved in big businesses; in other words, they have a far higher cost of compliance than big businesses. So the way the rules work discriminates against small business in Australia, which is the very area where, if there is to be any discrimination, there should be favourable discrimination. They are the employers who are, in fact, providing the increased employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the particular problems is that so many small businesses are involved in collecting sales tax when there are multiple different sales tax rates applicable to the products provided. There can be disagreements about the appropriate rate of sales tax. There are exemption certificates if you provide goods to some particular people. It is a massively expensive regimen that small businesses are put through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Economics References Committee has gone part of the way to meeting my request that there be a total overall review of the whole question of the costs of compliance to business, big and small. This committee quite properly recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Government conduct a comprehensive review of the sales tax exemptions and classifications system with a view to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) removing the ambiguities and complexities within and between the sales tax classification schedules; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) establishing a simple, effective process whereby the classification of new products can be quickly and simply achieved, thereby lessening reliance on the general rate of sales tax as a default rate.</PARA>
<PARA>I object to the way that the Taxation Office, in a sense, blackmails small businesses&mdash;it might be a hard word to use&mdash;which may well have inadvertently charged the wrong tax rate. They end up being prosecuted and being talked into arriving at settlements which they may well have not had to pay had they been able to afford the legal actions to protect their interests against the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that there has been an unfortunate situation in the area of tax and in the costs of compliance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the Senate's attention to the conclusions by the Senate Economics References Committee into the tax treatment of small business because the summation is that small business faces a plethora of tax regulations. The combination of many taxes that business has to comply with and the sheer complexity of each tax frequently results in an overbearing burden of responsibility on small business, as my colleague Senator Baume has so eloquently pointed out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This quest for money, the attempt to close loopholes, and the attempt to get money from limited sources creates complexity that is really beyond the ken of most small business people. If large businesses are getting into trouble with tax audits, I fear for small businesses because they do not have the expertise or the money to buy the skills that are necessary nowadays to understand tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An enormous amount of time is required by small businesses just to meet their obligations and the costs associated with them. I refer to the costs associated with the employment of specialists and the costs of the entrepreneur having to take additional time out from selling and doing the things that he knows best just to meet the tax obligations of this federal government. There is also the cost of miscalculation of tax obligations in terms of the nature of the penalties&mdash;the time interest penalties and the culpability penalties that apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must draw the Senate's attention to what I believe is a fairly unrealistic crackdown. When a lot of small businesses run into trouble and get behind with their debts, they suddenly find themselves, having almost paid off their debts, at a very late time being put into the court and their businesses wrecked. Currently a business in Tasmania is facing that very situation. Having struggled for perhaps 18 months to meet their tax obligations, they get within sight of paying it off and they suddenly find they are put before the courts and all they owe&mdash;perhaps 90 per cent of it&mdash;is tied up with penalties. In other words, the Taxation Office just got too demanding and was prepared to throw people out of work and destroy people's livelihoods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to last year's report from the Ombudsman, in which she said that too often marriages are ruined and businesses are destroyed by pre-emptive action by the Taxation Office. We know that the courts will always support the Taxation Office in the collection of revenue, but they fail to take into account the human misery that is caused as a result of too much pre-emptive action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to use this opportunity to draw attention to a number of the recommendations that perhaps have not been addressed in the public arena as much as they should, and I refer back to the concept of the carry back of losses and the carry forward of profits. Under the Australian tax regime, businesses are allowed to carry forward losses to a subsequent year of income where that loss may be offset against the profit and thereby the taxable income produced in the subsequent year. But, in the meantime, businesses may have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to a situation where a small business might be very dependent on one major customer. In one year, you bring to account all the revenue, which could be quite substantial, but if that business customer fails to pay the debt&mdash;the bad debt can amount to some hundreds of thousands of dollars&mdash;and if the business then gets into difficulties there is no carry back of that debt. In effect, in the previous year, as a result of the bringing of income into account on an accrual basis, tax is paid on the income. There is no cash flow because the debt has gone bad. At that stage of the business there is not sufficient income to allow the bad debt to be offset when it is actually bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a question about the time which is allowed before a debt is really bad, but it is the small businesses that tend to suffer most because of their lack of access to other forms of capital. So there is a dislocation to revenue in a depressed period, and there is a lack of finality in assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation from the committee is that the government should investigate the efficacy of limited carry back of losses for a limited period. Mr Shann Turnbull submitted to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The carry forward of profits is of special value to small businesses who do not have access to capital markets to make up for loss of liquidity when losses are incurred. In addition, banks are unlikely to provide carry-on cash to small business when losses are incurred and liquidity is most desperately required.</PARA>
<PARA>I would urge the government to look at that particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the capital gains regime, you have to keep your records indefinitely for capital gains transactions. The committee recognised that a proposal to phase out capital gains tax on assets which are held for the very long term&mdash;we are talking about 25 to 30 years&mdash;needs to be examined. Documents nowadays rarely exist for that sort of time, and there are going to be difficulties in vouching for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also difficulties with the prescribed payments system when payment is not received until the year of income following completion of work and rendering of an account; for example, in the period June to July. The income is assessable on those earnings in the earlier year even though the prescribed payments tax is not deducted until the later year, because it is withheld at the time of payment. Therefore, the person cannot get a credit for that tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is that, when the return is lodged, the taxpayer is taxed as if the prescribed payments tax had not been deducted, notwithstanding that he or she will get a credit in the following year. So a suggested solution was to allow the credit in a year in which the income is assessable, despite the fact that the tax will not be remitted until the following financial year. Here we virtually have a situation where, while you bring your revenue into account on an accrual basis, you are not allowed your deduction on an accrual basis; it is on a cash payment system. That works very much to the detriment of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other matter the committee was concerned about was with wine growers, particularly those wine growers who are in a small business and are provisional taxpayers. One of the difficulties in that industry is that the receipts are often received in three instalments before the end of the year and following through after the end of the financial year&mdash;in April, June and September. Small growers whose lump sum provisional tax of $8,000 or less is due by 31 March will not have received any payments for income which has been accrued and assessed, which will force payment through debt financing. We recommend that the wine growing industry look at taking advantage of the new PAYG system of payments because, without that, it will have some difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government should also look at the valuation of stock in the wine industry because when some of the better wines&mdash;the higher valued wines that Australia is particularly good at producing, particularly my own state of Tasmania&mdash;are put in stock there is a tax component which must be financed. This works very much to the detriment of the speciality wineries and those wineries that produce higher valued products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe this is a first-class report. I recommend that those people who are listening to this particular debate speak to their local politician and get a copy of this report on the tax treatment of small business, because it outlines the problems that small businesses face, particularly in areas of liquidity.

If you put together all the institutions and major businesses, such as BHP, that are so keen on stripping employees, the small business sector has actually outstripped them in the employment area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the government's boast about the creation of two million or so jobs over the last so many years of employing, the majority of employees have gone to the small business sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It has been described as the engine room of employment. That really was the focus of Rob Bastian's speech at the National Press Club yesterday: that the government really has to refocus on small business and have a bottom-up approach in its budget and in its economic strategy so that we can get small businesses to employ that one extra person in their business and basically wipe off the unemployment problem we have in this country, particularly in the area of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, small business has been the grounding of employment for youth. That is where they have got their first job; that is where they have got their confidence in employment. They have often gone on to an institution such as BHP, AMP or one of those big institutions. They have got their first job and their confidence in the workplace by beginning in a small business, such as a small retailer or a milk bar. In the areas of tax and industrial relations, which I do not have time to go into but which have been well canvassed in this house, small business really needs a refocus from this government, with a bottom-up approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly tonight about a particular problem facing Australia's tourist industry. The issue relates to the tax regime applied to bareboat charter operations. Bareboat charters are a fast expanding area of tourism in North Queensland in which people charter a boat, generally a sailing boat, without a crew. This particular tourist activity is becoming increasingly popular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax is imposed on some tourism vessels, including game fishing boats, sightseeing boats operating non-scheduled services and bareboat charter vessels. As the situation now stands bareboat operators are slugged with sales tax, discouraging domestic production of these vessels and discouraging the growth of this particular area of tourism. The actual level of sales tax, I think, is now 21 per cent. It was 20 per cent. If you are talking about a $250,000 vessel, that is a lot of money which is paid in sales tax&mdash;about $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, vessels which undertake scheduled sightseeing services and those used for commercial fishing are eligible for sales tax exemption. That is the same for those of us involved in agriculture who buy many of our implements and vehicles sales tax exempt, as do companies involved in mining. It seems a little unfair that the tourism industry has developed at a later stage. If there had been this sort of developing tourism industry when mining or agriculture were being developed, then I am sure the sales tax exemption that applies to those two industries would have been applied to the tourist industry as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March of this year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration released the report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS>, which investigated this aberration. The anomaly was succinctly put by a representative of the Whitsunday Bareboat Operators Association. He had bought the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Solo</EMPHASIS>, a 70-foot vessel which slept 13 passengers and departed at regular intervals each Sunday. It was sales tax exempt. He also had a 40-foot bareboat sailing vessel, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Catherine</EMPHASIS>, which slept eight passengers and departed at noon on any day he was able to hire it. That vessel was subject to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to the issue of taxation the House of Representatives committee took evidence from a wide range of people, especially in relation to tourist buses, vehicles and vessels that carried fewer than 12 passengers and did not have scheduled departure times and dates. Sensibly, the committee recommended that a sales tax exemption be granted for tourism buses and four-wheel drive vehicles of 12 seats and under. However, bareboat operators were not as lucky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the other recommendations made by the committee were that all vehicles which are used exclusively for earning assessable income be fully depreciable; that access to the diesel fuel rebate scheme be extended where the fuel is used in electricity generators which provide an essential service to areas not linked to the national electricity grid; that the export market development scheme be fully implemented in that consideration be given to the provision of equal access to the scheme for single service providers in the tourist industry at a rate of 50c in the dollar; and that the Council of Australian Governments consider means by which the payroll tax system can be reviewed in connection with the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition members of this committee had to dissent from the Labor members, and recommended that the sales tax exemptions be available to genuine bareboat operators for the purchase of vessels and parts for business use with unscheduled departure and arrival times. Unfortunately, the government has failed to act on this advice. This inaction was borne out when the committee visited a boat building factory which had closed largely as a result of the inability of the bareboat industry to implement their fleet replacement program and fleet growth programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have taken the view that an exemption from sales tax for bareboats without a compensatory tax on outputs of these businesses would effectively create a new anomaly within the taxation regime. The coalition members believe that, to a substantial extent, this already applied in industries that are wholesale sales tax exempt and the present system is anomalous to bareboat operators. Put simply, sales tax is not an appropriate tax to levy on the tourism industry. Evidence before the committee well and truly proved that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is one of Australia's most successful growth industries, generating revenue of more than $11 billion in foreign earnings last year. This represents a fivefold increase in 10 years from $2.4 billion earned in 1983-84. More than half a million Australians, or six per cent of the work force, are employed in the tourist industry, which itself generates jobs in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, we must nurture this industry. One way of doing this is for the government to immediately consider these sales tax breaks that would be very beneficial to an industry that is important to North Queensland and has an enormous potential. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I was diverted I was drawing attention to some photographs that I took while I was on a trip in China last month. I draw people's attention to them. People may care to get from the Table Office additional copies of those photocopied newsletters. Unfortunately, I did not bring additional copies with me and, because I have been so busy this week, I did not have time to copy them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three photographs contained on page 5 of the July edition identify me with some of the people who have been repatriated and returned to their homeland in China. There is a photograph of me with a young couple as we dined in the restaurant that these people owned. It was dining that would measure anything that one could get in Chinatown in Sydney or in Chinatown in any other capital city of this country. The people that I am photographed with are the owners of this restaurant who put on the feed for us. They were so pleased after they had received so many free feeds from the Australian authority whilst they were here. It cost some $A14,000 for him and his girlfriend to come on what he described as an adventure to Australia. He is now successfully repatriated back in his home and his restaurant is doing very nicely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second photograph is of me in a jewellery shop paying for a necklace that I purchased from another of the returnees, a person with magnificent skills to fashion a silver necklace such as this one. This necklace was actually given to my wife. So, Jackie, it is yours if you are looking in; I will not hang on to it. It shows you the skills of some of the people who have come to Australia, people who are held up by some as running in fear of persecution. There was certainly no persecution evident in the person who made this necklace for me, nor was there in his girlfriend who was in the same shop in the Beihai region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third photograph&mdash;which is not the best nor the most enlightening photograph of me&mdash;is of another young woman that I met in the fish processing factory. The reason I included this particular photograph is that she said she would love to return to Australia. Given the chance, she would probably come back illegally. The reason I mention that and put some emphasis on it is to show that, whilst I was using an interpreter from Australia&mdash;an Australian interpreter who could understand an Irish version of the Australian version of English and Chinese&mdash;the individual was not scared to speak up and say that, given the opportunity, she would return illegally to this country. It was a great experience for me to see these people who had been repatriated to prove, at least for these people&mdash;and I believe for everybody else who has been repatriated&mdash;that no persecution has taken place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak about the appalling treatment being meted out by this government to the science and research effort in this country&mdash;specifically that aspect of science dealing with the basic sciences, the fundamental sciences and those sciences which, paradoxically, are fundamental to the applied science, which this government seems to think is the only science that should be supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On many previous occasions I have pointed to the way in which the present Labor government has run down the basic science enterprise in this country, how it has seen science merely as the handmaiden of industry and the economy and how it sees no intrinsic value whatsoever in science for the sake of its cultural and educational enrichment. It is my belief that Senator Cook has no understanding of science whatsoever and is so bemused by his superficial economical rationalist model of society that he is quite incapable of understanding the real scientific effort or what it is that drives science and drives scientists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1940s the CSIRO began the development of several genetically pure strains of chickens. These genetic lines have been continued ever since, and there is now a great deal of knowledge in their genetic make-up. This biological resource is extremely valuable. All wild populations of animals and plants have very diverse genetic make-up. For properly controlled work in a number of areas, not just in animal work, one needs a source of animals with a known standard and an invariable genetic composition. Such animals are not only invaluable for work directly on those animals but also as models for a large range of other species. For example, these purebred chickens have been used quite extensively for very valuable work on the immune system, and this work has been carried out by scientists working on the human immune system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These chickens, which started breeding in the 1940s, have been developed by the CSIRO Division of Animal Production and have been used for research purposes over a period of nearly 50 years. Through the failure of the government to provide adequate funding and to direct the CSIRO to acquire funding from private sources, together with its inability to appreciate the value of such a resource, this 50 years of painstaking work is about to go down the gurgler. The minister has refused funding, CSIRO does not have sufficient funds to maintain the genetic stock and both have said that private sources have to maintain this valuable stock if it is to be maintained at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both yesterday and today the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) made great play of the fact that 20 eminent scientists had reported on the French nuclear tests. Therefore, he was taking note of what they had said. A much greater number of eminent scientists have appealed to the minister for science for the retention of this genetic stock, but the minister has shut his ears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me read from this list. It includes: the Australian Genetic Society; the Australian branch of the World's Poultry Science Association; the Australasian Association of Animal Breeding and Genetics; the Australian Veterinary Poultry Association; Professor Kevin Lafferty, director of the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University; Associate Professor Richard Frankham, Macquarie University; Dr Trevor Baghurst, CSIRO Division of Animal Health, Parkville, Victoria; Dr Max Whitten, formerly chief of the CSIRO Division of Entomology, Canberra; Dr Stephen Prowse, CSIRO Division of Animal Health, Parkville; Associate Professor Frank Nicholas, Department of Animal Sciences, University of Sydney; Dr Tony Dellaporta, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong; Professor Stewart Barker, Department of Animal Science, University of New England; Dr Harvey Wesbury, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong; Dr Jim Peacock, chief, CSIRO Division of Plant Industry, Canberra; Dr Bob Pemm, Veterinary School, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland; Dr Phil Glass, Parafield Poultry Research Centre, South Australia; Professor John James, School of Wool and Pastoral Sciences, University of New South Wales; Dr Nick Tierney, Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly, Queensland&mdash;I do not know whether he is a relation to Senator Tierney, who I understand will follow me&mdash;Professor John Mattock, Centre for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Queensland; Dr Peter Young, Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly, Queensland; Dr John Dingle, Intensive Livestock Department, University of Queensland; Dr Roger Chubb, Faculty of Rural Science, and so it goes on. I could read 50 names from that list of eminent, well-qualified scientists who are supporting the retention of this very important facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to Dr Bruce Sheldon, who has been working frantically to maintain this genetic stock, the minister wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have an obligation to administer my portfolio in such a way as to give optimum effect to the government's policies . . . I am advised that the continuation of support for the research in question has been considered without success by the CSIRO and the private sector. In other words, I have put a straitjacket on the CSIRO funding and the minister then blames the CSIRO for not continuing the funding of this basic research and, by implication, also blames the private sector for not picking up the tab. But much of the research that may have been based on this material does not relate to easily applicable results. Much of it is likely to be of a more basic nature which may or may not have extremely valuable but unpredictable results many years down the track.</PARA>
<PARA>There is also a letter from the division pointing out that the division does not have the funds to maintain the stock. The corporate secretary writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although these poultry represent a great asset, the Division finds that it is not in a position to sustain this work and the birds in question. Thus the Division thought the stock was valuable, unlike Senator Cook.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Sheldon tried to get the executive director, Dr John Stocker, to take the matter to the board, but he refused to do so. Perhaps the letter from Dr Stocker to Dr Sheldon is the most damning of all. It may help to explain why the government appointed Dr Stocker in the first place. Dr Stocker wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can well understand your frustration and disappointment at this situation, particularly after such a distinguished and energetic career in scientific research, largely based on these lines of poultry. However, given the lack of industry support for continuation of the lines I can see no option for CSIRO other than to listen to the marketplace. I cannot offer you any ray of hope and therefore cannot see any benefit in raising this issue with the CSIRO board.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook in another letter to Dr Sheldon emphasises the same bald economic imperative that he and the government think should drive the research effort in Australia. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that research in CSIRO will be driven significantly by the needs of industry and other users with long term needs having an important part to play in decisions . . . Maintenance of the flock without industry support, as you suggest, is not consistent with CSIROs mission to allocate funds to research which is driven by the needs of its partners.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, goodbye basic research; the government is not prepared to fund you. If private industry, which by its very nature is not interested in this type of research because of its long-term nature, does not fund you, bad luck, you won't get funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There we have it. The basic research effort of this country is being rapidly strangled by government decree. That research which industry wants will get funding; that which it cannot see an economic profit from or use for will cease. In this way, the very basis of our applied research will dry up in a few short years. Unless there is a change of direction, even the applied research will wither away, for applied research depends fundamentally on that basic and strategic research without which the applied research simply has nothing on which to build. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about a meeting that occurred yesterday with small business people in this city. I had a delegation from the Hunter come to see me about their concerns with government policy in relation to the small business area. At lunchtime at the National Press Club, the head of COSBOA, the Council of Small Business Organisations in Australia, Mr Bastian, addressed over 300 people and the national press on their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was central to the problems facing small business in this country, as outlined yesterday, was that what we have been faced with in the last 13 years under this Labor government has been a growing set of policies that were distinctly anti-small business. Year after year, this government adds further and further burdens to small business. The latest, of course, is the unfair dismissal provisions. I will come back to that in more detail later. We also saw, in the middle of this year, wholesale sales taxes go up yet again. The government were a little bit sneaky about this; they announced that in last year's budget for two years running, so they could automatically add it without announcing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen increases in the FBT rate. We currently face upward pressure on interest rates. In this last budget the government increased company sales tax from 33c to 36c. In case people think that is hitting only big businesses, let me say that it is also hitting 300,000 of the 860,000 small businesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combination of these recent measures with all the other measures this government has added over the last 13 years creates a very hostile business climate, where it is extremely difficult for businesses to grow and for new businesses to establish. The five minutes of economic sunshine that John Howard alluded to, and so successfully encapsulated in that comment, is very much true for the small businesses of Australia, particularly in rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of fact, many parts of Australia are still back in that 1990-93 recession. Many areas have come out of it but many small businesses are still there. So, it is with some hide that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says, `This is as good as it gets.' If this is as good as it gets for many small businesses in this country, they will go to the wall very soon and Australia will lose a golden opportunity for further economic expansion. It will be a tragedy for the people affected, not only in their livelihood but, in many cases, in the loss of all their assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Hunter, this is happening consistently. One small business a day is closing down in the Hunter. We invited Minister Schacht to come up and speak to us last May. He got a very hostile reception because of the small business people's reaction to the policies of his government over the last 13 years. But he did promise to do some things. That was back in May; it is now nearly September. About six months have gone by. Remember that one business is closing down every day. You can do the maths as to how many businesses have been lost over that time. We are still waiting, in this time of economic crisis for many small businesses, for the minister to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did promise to try to do something about those areas which he can do something about. He keeps trying to fob this off as a local government or state government problem. But under the Trade Practices Act he can certainly do something about the abuse of market power and unconscionable conduct by groups like chain stores, particularly with regard to their use of predatory pricing. A lot of big chains are using these sorts of practices which the minister refuses to act against. They are increasingly gaining market dominance. Seventy-seven per cent of economic power is now in the hands of these very large chains, much to the disadvantage of many small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the Senate's attention an example of this sort of behaviour by chains. The examples are from the Hunter Valley, from the towns of Port Stephens and Singleton. I have here virtually identical ads showing the price of broccoli. In one town it is being sold for 98c a kilo, which one would assume is its proper price, and in the other one it is being sold for 49c. That is almost half the price. What happens to the fruit and vegetable shop opposite when the chain nearby charges half price and consistently charges low prices? When they have driven these people out of business, they put their prices back up again. That is what is called unconscionable conduct and that is what this minister has some power to do something about. But he refuses to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, this government, not content with not acting within its power to help to improve the lot of small business, introduces additional legislation to make it more difficult. I refer particularly to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. This is not only a tragedy for small business, because they cannot operate properly, but also it is a tragedy for employment because many small business people say, `If I've got to act under that sort of tough law, how can I survive, how can I put people on?' So they do not put people on, and that is an additional tragedy for unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the small business people who visited us yesterday told us the story of how he wanted to dismiss an employee under this provision. The employee worked in his fruit and vegetable shop. He noticed that she kept taking out boxes which had lettuce leaves sitting on top. He got a little suspicious so he checked what was under these lettuce leaves. He found chocolates, bottles of other products being sold in the shop and some of the more expensive fruits. She was taking these home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had observed her for a few days and then he uncovered this. What would normally happen? If it was 200 years ago that employee would get seven years in Van Diemen's Land for such action. But today the employer is fearful of undertaking any action against an employee because the employer can end up in court. The person whom he is charging, his former employee, can end up paying out very little, if anything. Not only does the employer lose a lot of money in this action; he also loses a lot of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a government that is making it very difficult for small business in not applying the laws that exist and also in introducing new laws that make it even more difficult for business. Probably that is the reason why we did not see anything of Minister Schacht yesterday at the National Press Club. We had 300 small business people, not just business people but representatives of their organisations. It was a golden opportunity for the minister to present the great record of his government and what he was doing for these people. But where was Minister Schacht? He certainly was not down there. He did not even show his head. The reason he did not show his head was the appalling record of his party and his administration and the way in which they have made it incredibly difficult for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia should realise what this government is doing to small business and to unemployment in this country. They should take this very much into consideration when we get to the ballot box. It is just one more reason why this government should be thrown out when we get to the election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some brief comments in relation to a document which has been circulated in recent times entitled `Community attitudes to violence against women, an executive summary produced by the Office of the Status of Women'. Few people within the community would do anything other than condemn domestic violence and violence towards women. Having been a legal practitioner prior to my entry into this place and having had experience of acting for both victims and perpetrators of domestic violence, I have an ongoing interest in this matter. It really is a very unfortunate social phenomena and one which is causing a lot of dislocation within the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see that this report indicates that the tolerance or acceptance of domestic violence is virtually non-existent and that attitudes to it are hardening within the community. The matter that I wish to address is not so much the bandaid section, although I will do so briefly, on how to deal with it. I want to deal with the causes. It is interesting on page 11 of this report to read about measures to reduce violence against women. This is what the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When asked about ways to reduce violence against women, the knee-jerk response is to change the laws and introduce tougher penalties. After consideration, however, community education and counselling for those committing violence are given a higher priority than legal measures as ways to reduce violence against women.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very cogent summary and indicates the stance we as an opposition took to another form of social evil and how to overcome it, and that is in relation to our attitude to the Racial Hatred Bill, which was discussed earlier today. The way to overcome these sorts of social problems is community education and counselling, rather than having a simplistic knee-jerk reaction of trying to toughen the laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is dealing with the measures that need to be employed to overcome the problem. What gives rise to these problems? On page 8 of the report we are told that a wide array of factors contributes to domestic violence. When people are asked, `What do you think brings about domestic violence?' the top rated issue was financial pressure. Financial pressure on the family is the sort of pressure that is brought to bear on families because of taxation regimes by the federal government and the lack of support this government has shown to families. If we want to deal with the question of domestic violence we can do so by supporting the family unit. We on this side of the House, the Liberal-</PARA>
<PARA>National Party coalition, are unashamedly supportive of the family unit and will continue to be supportive of it. One of the spin-offs of that will be a reduction in domestic violence. Also, there is the concern that there are problems with communication. We as an opposition would support extra funds to allow communication to continue within family units on a proper basis. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In the case of purchased programs, the ABC is involved after the production is completed and therefore can have no control of production details.

All programs are first viewed by experienced program assessors who filter product before it goes to relevant program departments and schedulers. Any program in which there is blatant and obviously deliberate promotion of product or which features a product in a way that is not essential to the theme or storyline is rejected. It is recognised that product placement has become an integral part of under-financed film industries so that a character, for instance drinking a certain brand of whisky may be doing so as part of the character delineation or as a contra to an investor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Justice has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of fraud against the Commonwealth is one that this Government takes very seriously and has addressed in considerable detail. As you will recall, on 8 December 1994, I tabled in Parliament the Government's response to two important reports on fraud. These were a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance, and Public Administration entitled Focusing on Fraud (the Elliott Committee), and Chapter 9 of the Review of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements. The review, undertaken at my direction, was a comprehensive examination of the then current law enforcement arrangements in place within the Attorney-General's Portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's response to these two reviews is one of the most comprehensive and significant policy initiatives taken in the area of fraud control, both nationally and internationally. That initiative is outlined in the Fraud Control Policy of the Commonwealth incorporating an Interim Ministerial Direction on Fraud Control which I tabled in December 1994 as part of the Government response. For the first time, the Commonwealth has a fully comprehensive fraud control policy which sets the framework for best practice standards in fraud prevention, fraud reporting, fraud case handling, and training of officers involved in fraud control activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Elliott Committee report and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Review both highlighted the lack of information available to the Government on the extent and nature of fraud against the Commonwealth. All Commonwealth agencies have had in place fraud control measures as a result of the Government's 1987 decision on fraud control, but the total cost of public sector fraud is unknown. Prior to the introduction of the new Fraud Control Policy of the Commonwealth no formal process existed to provide whole of Government data on the actual cost of fraud against the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to rectify this gap in information, the Government, in its Fraud Control Policy of the Commonwealth, introduced a series of requirements that will assist in identifying the scope, nature and extent of fraud against the public purse. The Government:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">introduced comprehensive fraud reporting requirements for all Commonwealth agencies that come within the scope of the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act, and entities within the scope of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act which are budget funded for their operating costs; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">established the Commonwealth Fraud Information Database (CFID), administered by the Australian Federal Police, to collate the fraud information reported by agencies. The CFID will provide information and intelligence to support agency and AFP investigations, and be a source of statistical reporting to Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the obligation to report fraud information to the CFID, there is a requirement on agencies to report information on general losses, overpayments and recovery of money which is not directly attributable to fraud to the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFP now has in place computer hardware and software to operate CFID, and agencies have been requested to report to the CFID cases of fraud detected after 1 July 1995. It will be some time before the CFID contains sufficient information to permit valid conclusions to be drawn about the cost, nature, and extent of fraud against the Commonwealth. The reporting arrangements are now in place to allow this to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board is also required to report annually to Government through me on progress on fraud control within the Commonwealth.

For the period 1983 to 1988 no figures are available but the Commonwealth did provide funds towards the National Tree Program for revegetation works. For the period 1989 to 1993 an average of 30 000 ha were established per annum by activities funded under the One Billion Trees Program. The annual revegetation figure could be expected to be significantly higher since there are a number of other Commonwealth and State funded tree establishment programs in operation. These include programs under the Murray-Darling Basin Commission's Natural Resource Management Strategy, and the Land and Water Program administered by the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government's northern basing initiatives will see the relocation of the 1st Brigade from Holsworthy to Darwin by the year 2000, with approximately 1300 Regular Army personnel being relocated. The effect of this initiative on the Holsworthy area is being partly offset by the progressive re-establishment of the 4th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, with a strength of over 700 personnel. In addition, other Regular and General Reserve elements will move to Holsworthy Barracks, predominantly from Ingleburn and Randwick. Vacant facilities at Holsworthy will be used to accommodate these elements where possible. There will, however, be a requirement for some new facilities to be provided, whilst upgrade of others will be needed. It is intended that, by the year 2002, some $90m will have been spent on new and upgraded facilities at Holsworthy. By that time, Holsworthy will house approximately 3000 Regular and Reserve personnel, which will represent a substantial increase over the 1995 strength at the base.

Any such disposal would be carried out under the normal Commonwealth procedures and future uses would need to be compatible with the continuing Defence presence at Holsworthy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Use of the Falcon 900 aircraft for special purpose flights is cost recovered from the agency requesting the special purpose flight.
