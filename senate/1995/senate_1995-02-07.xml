<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer again to the electoral fraud perpetrated on the Australian people at the last election when Mr Keating promised the l-a-w tax cuts, no new taxes, the removal of all pensioners from the income tax system, and non child-care cash rebates for all. Now that the true deceit of these promises has been laid bare for all Australians to witness, will you rule out the introduction of any new taxes such as a carbon tax, a hotel tax, an airline tax and a further rise in personal tax through the introduction of compulsory superannuation payments?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="569" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has made it perfectly clear, through statements by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, that we do not rule out certain revenue options. We are not in the business of identifying with any precision at all at this stage what those particular options might be. Obviously we want to keep any taxation increases to an absolute minimum, for reasons that have been spelled out fully and thoroughly by the Prime Minister. We want to place the primary emphasis on outlays reduction and we will do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in contemplating what revenue options are available to us, it is important to appreciate that we are genuinely one of the lowest taxed countries in the OECD, notwithstanding some highly selective alternative versions of the reality that have been recently published, including in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> this morning. We do have the second lowest tax burden in the OECD after Turkey, with lower taxes than certainly Japan, the United States and Britain. Total tax revenue as a proportion of GDP in 1992 was 28.5 per cent for Australia; it was 29.4 per cent for both Japan and the United States, and 35.2 for the United Kingdom. That is looking at the total tax burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one wants to talk about the tax burden, I think it is appropriate to contemplate what exactly was the record of this particular lot opposite when they last had a chance themselves to do something about the tax burden on the Australian people. If we look at government revenue now under Labor as a percentage of GDP, we see that the figure is 24 per cent. If we look at government revenue in its totality under Howard as Treasurer in the period 1982-83, we find a figure of 26.1 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr President, on the issue of relevance. The question clearly concerned the Labor Party promises at the last election, the promises that Keating made to the people. The question asked whether the Labor Party proposed to stick to those promises&mdash;in particular the promise that Mr Keating made that there would be no new taxes. What value, Senator Evans, a Labor Party election promise?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We made perfectly clear that there was no such promise&mdash;it was for no tax increases as a percentage of GDP and that was made abundantly clear on a thousand occasions. But if we compare the taxation options available to us, it is very important to do so in the context of the situation in the past, and when we look at the very successful record of this government in reducing tax revenues, and the options that accordingly exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax revenues as a percentage of GDP under Howard in 1982-83 was 24 per cent; under Labor at the moment it is 21.8 per cent. The top marginal tax rate under Howard was 60 per cent; under us, 47 per cent. The bottom marginal tax rate under Howard was 30 per cent; under us, 20 per cent. The company tax rate under Howard was 46 per cent; under us, 33 per cent. The taxation of dividends&mdash;double taxed under Howard; there is an imputation system under us. This is the reality of our commitment to reduce taxes. It is reduced as a proportion of total revenue. The taxation percentage itself is reduced. Every marginal rate is reduced. Company tax has been reduced and we have introduced a system of imputation, as distinct from the double taxation of dividends which applied under you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We keep being told that this was 12 years ago; this was the past. Let me say this: those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. That is what we remember and that is what the Australian public will remember about your performance. You were absolute frauds. You talk about assistance to business and you imposed tax rates upon business that were far in excess&mdash;13 per cent, 10 per cent, 13 per cent&mdash;of what we are imposing. You imposed a tax system which was a burden upon business. We have relieved that burden. You imposed a tax system that was a burden upon ordinary taxpaying people of this country. We have relieved that burden and we will continue to do so because we are responsible economic managers in a way that you could never have been and never will be now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is hard to imagine that this is the government that legislated away the l-a-w tax cuts, that imposed the new fuel taxes, that abandoned the pensioner promise and now clearly is going to renege on its child-care promise. The point is that there is one tax promise this government will keep, and that is the one that is now going to increase taxes. What Australians want to know for the present and the future&mdash;those in small business and those paying mortgages&mdash;is what new taxes will they have to pay and at what rate will they have to pay them. Why should you announce that you are going to increase taxes in January and tell them that they will not know the details until May? How do you expect Australians to plan for their future in that environment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I refer the minister to the opening last week in Chicago of an Austrade investment promotion office, run under the portfolio's investment promotion program. I understand that this is the third such office to be established in the United States, with others operational in New York and San Jose. Can the minister inform the Senate how this new office will contribute to investment promotion activities in the US? Does the opening of this office in the US reflect significantly an increase in interest from North America in investment options in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does reflect significantly on increased North American interest in investment in Australia. One of the functions of my portfolio is to promote both domestic and international investment in Australia. Last Wednesday, His Excellency the Australian Ambassador to the United States, Don Russell, opened an Austrade office in Chicago, Illinois. This Austrade office has as its key role investment promotion in the mid-west of the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade is, of course, part of the portfolio of my colleague the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan. My portfolio has contracted Austrade to deliver the investment promotion program on behalf of the Australian government. It is a good example of the two portfolios working very closely together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Working Nation last year, the government announced that it would extend the network of investment promotion services in the world. We announced a new office, which we opened in October last year, in Singapore and we announced this office, which we have now opened, in Chicago. The Chicago office is headed up by Mr Terry J. LaRocca, who was formerly the international marketing manager for Asia for the Illinois Department of Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the question implied, we now have three investment offices in the United States&mdash;in New York, San Jose and Chicago. The Chicago location was chosen because 170 of the Fortune 500 companies are located within a 500-mile radius of Chicago. That is the region this investment office will be serving. Of course, the mid-west of the United States is the backbone of the industrial element of the United States economy. It is in that region that we will be seeking investment for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the prominence of the United States as an investment promotion target for Australia is that the United States is, obviously, still the world's largest source of foreign direct investment. While it dipped a few years ago and fell off the No. 1 spot, the US is now back as the leading source of foreign investment in Australia of all other countries. Therefore, we are concentrating our efforts there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investment promotion program has been outstandingly successful. We have attracted a number of regional headquarters to Australia. Some have been relocated out of Asia to Australia because of the benefits of being located here. Some 94 regional headquarters have been located here over the last period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The investment promotion office will be drawing to the attention of United States business and commerce reasons for Americans to invest in our economy, such as very high growth and very low inflation. We have maintained a scenario of high growth and low inflation, which is indeed an outstanding achievement in terms of the world investment community. We also have high growth in jobs&mdash;nearly half a million jobs. We will deliver on our election promise of creating half a million jobs one year before our term is due to expire. So we will have done that early. It is a good achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment itself is growing in Australia, as we know. The 14 1/2 per cent forecast in the budget is now around 25 per cent&mdash;an outstanding performance. That the tax levels in Australia are the second lowest in the whole of the OECD, certainly lower than the tax burden in the United States, is another reason why investment is flowing into this economy. These good, positive selling points for why foreign investment should come here are supported not only by the government in this investment office but also by a whole raft of Australian businesses who support us in these endeavours. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. In your letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 3 February last, you defended the inclusion of compartment 2331 in the Glenbog State Forest on the original list of 1,300 coupes because it was `old-growth forest'. We now know that that compartment is bisected by a powerline, has been grazed since 1927, logged twice for sawlogs and half logged under integrated harvesting as recently as 1978.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really do think that Senator Alston again shows his ignorance about the objectives of the national forest policy statement in terms of having in place a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system in Australia for all types of forest. In developing the list of coupes, my portfolio identified areas of forest which are likely to be of high conservation value and, therefore, may be required for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. If we had had the task of doing this job some 200 years ago, I think it would have been very easy but, unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to do it within that time frame.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have now is a situation where many of our forests have been disturbed in one way or another. Of course, many of our forests have been lost forever. That is the reality. That is the situation we face. It is not necessarily an insurmountable problem because there is no reason&mdash;none at all&mdash;why areas that have been disturbed in some way cannot be considered for inclusion in a reserve system. I think these are the important points: what is the nature, and what is the impact of the disturbance that has taken place in any particular coupe?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are modern logging operations such as clear-felling, which obviously have accompanied the development of the woodchipping industry, that have a more significant impact on environmental values than selective logging does.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important point, Senator. I am aware that there is, of course, the presence in a number of coupes of structures that may have caused some form of disturbance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is aware of a range of inclusions in the 1995 coupes. In most cases they represent a very insignificant percentage of a coupe, a very small amount of area in a coupe. For example, the one that has been used often, whether it be a powerline or a small gravel quarry or the like, is very small in terms of its area in a large coupe. Of course, that does not suggest in any way that the remainder of the coupe does not have high conservation values and is not worthy of protection. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Your answer, Minister, four minutes worth, was nothing to do with what was contained in your letter where you tried to justify the inclusion of compartment 2331 as old-growth forest because it had something to do with the protection of arboreal mammals. I would have thought you would at least be able to regurgitate that one. But I ask you: doesn't the national forestry statement define old-growth forest as forest that is ecologically mature and that has been subjected to negligible unnatural disturbance, such as logging, roading and clearing? How can that definition possibly include 69 of the 249 listed compartments in New South Wales which have been roaded and logged at least twice?

There are national estate values, world heritage values, endangered species values, biodiversity values and Aboriginal heritage values.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The minister will be aware of increasing speculation about the possibility that the worst drought on record is about to break.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of those perceptions and, of course, primary producers, farmers, find them very frustrating in that, as soon as you get the first fall of rain, people immediately say, `Well, the drought's finished.' It clearly is not. I think with all those people, certainly those who have been dealing with me over the last 12 months, one of the things they will not do is try to put some sort of green gloss on what in fact is a dry paddock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do have to acknowledge that there have been good rains. For the first time in 12 months, and I am finally getting a little hopeful, the experts from the met bureau&mdash;and these days weather forecasting is becoming increasingly more accurate&mdash;are saying that there are real hopeful signs now, in terms of a reduction in the southern oscillation index, that we may have returned to more normal seasons this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I opened the ABARE Outlook `95 conference this morning. I was pleased to see that there were a huge number of delegates&mdash;well over 1,200; there is a lot of interest in this conference. ABARE will be providing information to the conference later this week that farmers can expect a significant boost to their incomes and production in the next financial year should the drought actually break. ABARE expects our major cropping industries to recover more than 50 per cent of the production lost this financial year. I am sure all coalition senators will join us on the government side in hoping that will happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perception, however, still seems to exist amongst certain sections of the community that rain immediately puts an end to drought and that the federal government's drought assistance scheme finishes at the same time. In both cases, that is not correct. One of the important changes that was made in the drought package that was brought down last year is that a statutory period of six months was introduced so that the exceptional circumstances payments will continue after the exceptional circumstances declarations are lifted. Of course, farmers will have access to interest rate subsidies under the normal rural adjustment scheme beyond that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the number of farming families who are in receipt of the DRP has now exceeded 8,000; there are 8,206 families receiving the drought relief payment. They will continue to receive such payments for a full six months after the exceptional circumstances declarations are lifted. The approval rates for applications are now running at around 88 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also misconceptions&mdash;and this must be said&mdash;on the farming side of the community about eligibility for exceptional circumstances. The true English meaning of the word `exceptional' has to be attributed to it; the circumstances have to be exceptional in order to receive these payments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to his statements on the Radio National breakfast program with Peter Thompson this morning. How does he explain the obvious inconsistency between a position recognising Indonesia's annexation of East Timor while at the same time continuing to profess support for a process of self-determination for the people of East Timor?  Does the minister believe that Australia has ever really pursued or campaigned for a process of self-determination for the people of East Timor? Will Australia now move to repeal the 1989 Timor Gap treaty, to genuinely work towards a process of self-determination for the people of East Timor and, when that is achieved, to negotiate a Timor Gap treaty which would give a fair share of the profits back to the Timorese people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a lot of misunderstanding about the concept of the right to self-determination, which it might be helpful for me to clarify at the outset. The right of self-determination of peoples is recognised in general terms in the UN charter in articles 1 and 55, but I think it is fair to say that it has always been a very imprecise concept. It is presently subject to quite a lot of international rethinking, particularly because of the proliferation of claims to self-determination by national entities within larger sovereign states, as distinct from the more familiar colonial context. It is worth acknowledging that at the outset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of what self-determination means in any particular case and how it might be exercised in any particular context is a matter to be pursued by the United Nations. There are a number of UN resolutions on this subject, and they make it clear that self-determination can involve a number of quite different outcomes, including of course the emergence of an independent state, but also integration, or some form of association within or with another state, or a degree of autonomy within another state. I think that is important background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of East Timor, Australia recognises that the people of East Timor do have a right of self-determination&mdash;to choose, in effect, how they are governed. This has been Australia's position since before the events of 1975, and it has never been reversed. The UN, in relation to East Timor, has certainly recognised that there can be no solution to self-determination and related issues without the cooperation of the Indonesian government; thus the consultations with Indonesia which are now being conducted under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General and which Australia fully supports, and has done since their inception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question about inconsistency, Portugal argues that Australia cannot both recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor and, at the same time, say that the East Timorese have a right to self-determination. Senator Bourne seems to want to embrace that Portuguese claim of inconsistency. The situation is that before 1975 Australia recognised Portuguese sovereignty over East Timor while, at the same time, simultaneously recognising the right to self-determination of the Timorese people. There is no difference between the situation then and now. A claim of a right to self-determination can exist with a recognition of sovereignty. We recognised Portuguese sovereignty then&mdash;and, in fact, up until 1979 before we formalised it&mdash;and since 1979 we have recognised Indonesian sovereignty, but we have also recognised right through that period the right to  self-determination by the people of East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the Timor Gap treaty, which Senator Bourne wants us to repeal, it is important to realise, because this too has got lost in the argument about this case, that Australia negotiated the Timor Gap treaty not to gain access to anyone else's resources but to our own share of the resources of the Timor Gap area. Australia could not do that before the treaty because there was no agreed international boundary line in that area. As Indonesia was in control of East Timor, Australia had to negotiate with Indonesia to settle the boundary issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Portugal cannot seriously pretend that it is now, or has been since 1975, in a position to give effect to an agreement on the Timor Gap. I have to say that generally, whatever might have been the situation before 1975 or before 1979, we simply do not accept that, in 1995, Portugal, the colonial power which governed that territory so lamentably and ultimately abandoned the territory, continues to have any right whatsoever over East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Australia has always tried to generate actual results rather than rhetoric for the people of East Timor. I have run out of time, but if you want to ask me how, I will tell you how in a supplementary.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the pleasing aspects about this is that the government has been able to assist by providing over $1 million in the Working Nation statement to help promote the Commonwealth Development Bank's programs and lending policies for the small- to medium-sized enterprises in the community. The Development Bank has discovered that many possible borrowers were not aware of the bank's available facilities. As a result of that work, and as a result of the Development Bank's own survey work, it will be able to provide an extra $300 million in the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the major increase in this lending will be to manufacturers in the small- to medium-sized area. The Commonwealth Development Bank conducted a survey in November and December of last year which showed that more than 90 per cent of the manufacturing SMEs expected to grow during 1995. The most interesting figure of all was that already 50 per cent of those manufacturing small businesses were exporting, another 10 per cent had plans to export and a further seven per cent were interested in exporting.

One of the reasons why families are in a far better position at the moment than they have been over previous years, the years of the recession, is that job security and family incomes are high. In fact, for the family unit disposable income is now at a quite high level in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the minister's recent magical mystery tour of Cuba. The minister will be aware that following his appearance on Friday before a Senate committee, contradictory reports have appeared in the media, and in particular about the outstanding debt by Cuba to Australia of around $17 million. As a result of Senator Evans's negotiations with the Castro government, has this debt in effect been written off? Furthermore, could he outline the terms of the new line of credit which will be granted to Cuba, and in particular how many Australian taxpayers' dollars have been committed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that some thoroughly confused reporting appeared in the media after the estimates committee hearing from a reporter who, despite, I am told, being thoroughly briefed, was utterly unable to grasp the distinction between a debt being written off and rolled over. The truth of the matter is exactly as I described it to Senator Kemp in the estimates committee hearings, namely the broad nature of the agreement that was canvassed during my discussions in Cuba and which I hope will be brought to consummation in a couple of months time is a result whereby the existing $17 million debt, a combination of capital and interest, would in fact be paid off&mdash;not written off but paid off, perhaps with some negotiated reduction as is common in these cases, but paid off&mdash;in order to clear the decks with EFIC. But it may well then be that a line of credit of an equivalent amount on a short term basis might then be established in order to enable the supply from Australia of other commodities much in demand in Cuba.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the broad basis of the agreement. That will be the subject of further discussion over the next few weeks and hopefully this will be resolved. It is an outstanding matter which has not been helpful to Cuba's commercial reputation in this country and is a matter which this government has made many representations about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My visit to Cuba of course was not simply designed to address that particular issue. It was also designed to advance Australian commercial interests because there is a very substantial mining investment of some $400 million to $500 million presently being contemplated that we hope shortly will be brought to fruition. Moreover, there are a number of multilateral issues of some consequence that needed to be addressed. I refer to the issue of Cuba's constant cold war preoccupied obstruction in international forums of arms control and disarmament negotiations, and indeed an obstructive attitude that it takes on many other matters of multilateral diplomacy. In those circumstances it is important, through dialogue of this kind, to try to encourage the country out of that time warp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, it is the case that Australia will be a candidate for the Security Council of the United Nations in 1996 and it is important to pay attention to what remain very influential members of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 developing countries. It was in that context also that this visit was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point of the visit was to make some very direct representations to the Cubans about their human rights performance. I was prepared to acknowledge, quite frankly, that when it comes to a number of the economic and social rights, the performance over the years has been good, particularly in the context of health and education. I was also prepared to acknowledge that a number of the steps that had been recently taken towards opening up the economy, developing a marketing pricing system, opening the economy to investment and so on, are also much to be applauded in terms of economic freedoms of people within that country. But there is an obvious continuing problem so far as political and civil rights are concerned, rights to freedom of expression, rights to free association, and free elections. These are matters which continue to give concern to the international community. I took the opportunity of that visit to make some quite strong representations about those particular matters. The choice as always is whether or not to seriously address these areas of difference, of principle and practice and to seek to persuade; or whether, rather, to impotently, feebly and noisily stand off, hurling insults in the way that has become so characteristic of this opposition. I make no apologies whatever for the role that I played in relation to that particular visit, and nor will I ever.</PARA>

<PARA>There are two lessons to be learnt from the Keating government's record on taxation. The first is that clearly and inarguably the Keating government is a high tax government. Labor is a high taxing government. The Australian people know it. If they had read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today they would have had it confirmed. Although it was dismissed by Senator Gareth Evans, in terms of income tax the survey by Ernst and Young&mdash;highly respected chartered accountants in our community&mdash;confirmed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that `Australians pay considerably more income tax than those earning similar salaries in Japan, the United States and Britain.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point in this whole tax debate is that Australians are paying a high level of income tax. The minister tried to compare the record of this government with that of the last coalition government. In fact, Australians, as far as it is particularly relevant, pay a lot more income tax now. Mr President, if you look at the marginal rate on the last dollar&mdash;which is what really counts&mdash;you will see that under Labor taxpayers pay 36.9c; under the coalition they paid 30.6c. In income tax terms, they now pay considerably higher tax on the marginal rate on the last dollar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under you, the highest rate on marginal tax rates on the last dollar, 36.9c; under us, 30.67c. It is much higher under Labor than under the coalition, which is consistent with the attitude towards tax of the party. The Labor Party is a high tax party. We have seen it time and time again through history. Let us look at income tax as a proportion of total earnings. Under Labor in the last year available, 1993-94, it was 16c; under the coalition in the last year it was in government it was 14c. In effect, income tax has gone up in the areas that particularly count for the Australian taxpayer and that has been confirmed by Ernst and Young today. It is something that every Australian taxpayer has known all along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second lesson, however, is that you cannot trust Labor's taxation promises. What did Labor promise at the last election? It promised that it would keep its l-a-w tax cut. In fact, it said it was more than a promise; it had been written into law, so the Australian people could totally depend on that. It could not change; it was in the statute book. Of course, Labor got into office and immediately broke that promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party said that it would not put up income tax. What did it do? It put up the fuel taxes as soon as it got in with that disastrous budget that was brought in. It had no concern about the promise that had been made at the previous election. That was irrelevant because all that was about was winning the election. It was not about a commitment to the Australian people, an obligation that would follow from winning. It was put to the Australian people as an inducement for their votes during that election. Broken promises, again and again. </PARA>

Now, of course, we have the child-care cash rebate scheme, which the Labor Party did implement without a means test when it got into government. Two years down the track there is no doubt at all that it is about to renege on that  promise and introduce some form of means test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do senators remember Mr Keating standing up before the women of Australia prior to the election and saying, `This is how we will be distinguished from the coalition: we can do it.

That is, a 2.1 per cent reduction in the total level of taxation has been effected under Labor from the level under the coalition when it was last in government.

It fails to include additional payments normally paid separately on  individuals' incomes in overseas countries, such as social security payments and payroll taxes. Whilst the Ernst and Young study includes the Medicare levy in Australia, it ignores the similar but much higher levies in overseas countries.

Then at the same time, as was so rightly exposed by Senator Hill in his question today, we are facing this prospect of additional taxes&mdash;taxes at all levels, whether direct or indirect. That is what is going to hurt every average Australian family to such a huge extent. That is the issue that this heartless government fails to address. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that ought to be asked is not what the government is going to do by way of further tax revenue increases but what the opposition is going to do to fund the gigantic pile of promises that are being thrown away by it already and which continue to be thrown away by opposition spokesmen. If you look at The Things That Matter, that ill-fated document, and you look at some of the expenditure increases, the outlay increases that have been flagged there, and you look at our preliminary costings of them, what do you find?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find tax exemption&mdash;this is by way of either outlay increases or revenue reductions to which you are committed&mdash;of interest that we reckon will cost around $3 billion; health care rebate that we cost somewhere between $1.5 billion and $3 billion; tax and family payment system changes which will cost somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion; and capital gains tax changes that you have foreshadowed which will cost something like $0.2 billion. That gives us somewhere between $6.7 billion and $9.2 billion for a start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, you have some other things on which we do not really have enough information&mdash;because you have not given it to us yet&mdash;to be able to even remotely put a costing on them. But these are things such as cutting public hospital waiting lists; increased participation in tertiary education; upgrading national infrastructure; increasing Australian Federal Police resources; and addressing the inadequacies of Aboriginal housing&mdash;God knows what it will cost if you honour those commitments you have made!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, you have the commitments that were made some time ago about regional policy: the creation of an infrastructure fund, which seems to imply expenditure of somewhere between $1 billion and $3 billion. You have little Mr Howard's income splitting proposal which, unless he is now going to renege and wander away from it, is something like $3 billion&mdash;that is the cost at which we have estimated that. Of course, you also have the universal pension scheme, as has been floated by your spokesperson Mr Ruddock just a few weeks ago, which will cost no less than about $5 billion. If you put a very conservative estimate on all those figures, and if you do not even take into account the ones that we have not been able to cost at the moment, you are talking about outlay increases or revenue reductions of the order of $18 billion, quite apart from the problem of what you do about the carryover deficit that already exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Come clean; what does all this mean? It could only mean one of the following four things. In the first place, it could mean that you are not serious about any of these promises; they are simply bribes, they are simply empty. You are not going to deliver on them; you are being utterly dishonest; it is all utterly fraudulent. It could mean that. Secondly, it could mean that all these things will occur but they are not going to be paid for by either outlay reductions elsewhere or by tax increases, in which case you would be adding massively to the deficit and behaving in a way that is utterly economically irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it could mean that these outlay increases or revenue reductions will in fact occur and that they will be paid for, but by massive outlay cuts elsewhere&mdash;cutting into health, education, welfare, infrastructure, transport expenditure&mdash;in a way that would be utterly devastating for the people of this country and the economy of this country. Alternatively, the fourth possible option is that these various outlays and increases that you have promised will occur and will be paid for by massive tax increases of your own&mdash;massive tax increases of the kind necessary to deal not only with these additional outlays of some $18 billion but also whatever is left of the deficit from us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was absolutely fascinating to hear the response to the question Senator Hill asked Senator Gareth Evans. The issue was broken tax promises. The issue at the last election was taxes. The government and Mr Keating made some specific promises in relation to taxes. These promises have been comprehensively broken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this chamber before that if any Labor member is prepared to stand up and say that Mr Keating's promised l-a-w tax cuts will not occur and that fuel taxes have increased by a massive seven to nine cents a litre, I would be quite happy to get up and apologise. Of course that will not happen. Mr Keating promised that the l-a-w income tax cuts would be in place and that taxes would not rise as a percentage of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said&mdash;and this is important&mdash;that there would be no new taxes. One of the issues Senator Hill raised with Senator Evans was: having broken all these other tax promises, can you tell us the current status of the promise on new taxes. We could not even get an answer to that question. It was intriguing that Senator Evans pretended that there was no such promise. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 7 October 1993, among other things, Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, it was made clear that while there would be no new taxes of an indirect kind and while the overall burden would be maintained at roughly its proportion of GDP, nothing more was said on that subject.</PARA>

You will not do what Keating tells you. You are the only minister in this government like that. I must admit that, if I have to give you credit, Senator Ray, I will give you credit for that. I can imagine Paul saying to you, `Now, come on, Robert. You get into the Senate and you start to defend me and try to attack those Liberals.' I know exactly what you would say to Keating. You would treat Keating with the contempt that most other people in this parliament treat him with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to bring to your attention, in light of the intervention by Senator Cook, a table prepared and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> of December 1993. It shows income tax as a percentage of gross earnings in 1992. Would you believe it? Of the 24 or so countries listed, Australia was the fifth highest country in relation to income tax paid as a percentage of gross earnings&mdash;based on the average wage of a family with two children. What is this nonsense that Labor ministers are trotting out? They have been told by Mr Keating to tell Australian families that they are low taxed and that they should presumably be delightfully happy that he is about to break yet another election promise and impose new taxes on them. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subregulations 6(8) and (9) provide for the refund or remission of export inspection and meat charges in specified circumstances at the discretion of the Secretary. The Committee wrote to the Minister on 1 December 1994 asking for advice on whether the discretions should be subject to AAT review. The Minister replied on 23 January 1995 advising that review procedures were inappropriate as the issue of refunds was discussed and agreed with representatives of relevant industry groups prior to the exercise of the discretionary power contained in s.6(8) and (9).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has written again to the Minister asking for advice on the manner in which the discretion would be exercised where there was no agreement between the Secretary and representatives of the relevant industry groups; the manner in which the Secretary would ascertain the views of those persons who might be affected by a decision, but who are not members of relevant industry groups; and whether the amended regulation is capable of possible differential application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Military Superannuation and Benefits Trust Deed (Amendment) (No.2 of 1994) under s.5 of the Military and Superannuation Benefits Act 1991</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This instrument amends the Trust Deed in relation to the payment of employer benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to Rule 51 of the Deed authorise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to approve payment of part of the employer benefit included in the preserved benefit "because of particular circumstances". The Committee has written to the Minister asking for advice on whether the exercise of the discretion is subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument also amends the Trust Deed by including a new Schedule 4A. This Schedule enables the calculation of the National Employer Benefit in any year by reference to CPI increases as published by the Statistician. In its 1993-94 Annual Report, the Committee expressed the view that, where regulations made under one Act defined a matter in relation to a register kept under another Act, "the incorporation would be valid only if it referred to the register as existing when the regulations were made". This was the Committee's preferred view of s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act. The Committee has also asked the Minister for advice as to the effect of s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act on the validity of the incorporation of "CPI increases published by the Statistician" in the present amendment to the Trust Deed.</PARA>

<PARA>All these questions were put on notice on or before 29 November 1994. This means that Mr Lee has had over two months to answer them. On 30 January, the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee informed my office that it had been told that a significant majority of the questions had been completed and were awaiting the minister's approval. The committee set a deadline of 23 January for the receipt of these answers. Usually departments are given a month to answer questions on notice and sometimes even less for estimates questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told by the committee that all the answers have been received to questions on notice put to all other portfolios in the estimates hearings. There has not been one single answer provided from the communications and the arts portfolio. This is despite the minister writing to the committee saying that the answers would be provided as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Usually answers are provided to estimates committees in batches. I understand that some answers may take longer than others. However, this minister's failure to answer even one question in over two months is a blatant and arrogant thumbing of the nose at the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the acting chair of the committee on 30 January expressing concern about this matter. The chair then wrote to the minister on 31 January conveying my concerns. That was more than a week ago. Despite this reminder, we are now told&mdash;as communicated to my office at around lunchtime&mdash;that only 10 per cent of the answers could be provided by tomorrow, 50 per cent by Friday and the rest by Monday, 13 February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is totally unsatisfactory. The committee is due to reconvene on Thursday, 16 February. Under the standing orders, the last day for reserving matters to be examined in the supplementary hearings is 13 February. How can we know what to reserve for the supplementary hearings? The only option is to reserve all matters that relate to questions placed on notice in the first round of hearings. This means that these hearings could go on for days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if these questions are not of some significance. Anyone who looks at some of the questions that are on notice will very quickly appreciate that they are not simply point scoring questions. They are designed to elicit information which ought to be on the public record and which is very necessary for the formulation of broadcasting policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example: why was the payment to the Public Broadcasting Foundation in support of ethnic news radio reduced from $1.9 million in 1992-93 to $140,000 in 1993-94? How much funding is the Commonwealth providing to subsidise the cost of modifying decoders to allow people in remote areas of Queensland to continue to receive ABC and SBS broadcastS? On how many occasions has the ABA examined whether Canwest's involvement in Channel 10 is in accordance with the Broadcasting Services Act? To what extent does Telstra enjoy a monopoly in relation to the operation and maintenance of National Transmission Agency facilities? How does Australia Post ensure that its non-core services, such as the sale of stationery through its retail outlets, remain financially separate from its core mail and parcel services? Which, if any, current Commonwealth funded programs and activities will be subsumed into the Gallery of Aboriginal Australia? How will Australian media enterprises finance the development and commercialisation of multimedia and interactive media products? Another question asked was: For each recipient of an Australian artist creative fellowship since its inception, please provide the purposes for which the artist claimed in his or her application the fellowship would be used and whether the stated objectives of the application were achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those questions go to the heart of the process of the parliament because, unless those answers are known, then this government is able to make do with propaganda churned out by Mr Lee on a regular basis&mdash;without being held accountable in any form, without being tested as to the merits of the propositions and without any questioning of government policy. That is tantamount to saying that we ought to simply ignore the parliamentary processes and allow the executive to get on with government. I have heard Mr Keating say that on a number of occasions, and I have no doubt that that is his view. In fact, I think as recently as yesterday he said something like, `The House of Representatives ought not to worry about the budget, and when it arrives in the Senate we ought to just give it a tick.' That is typical of the attitude of arrogance that is no doubt second nature to the Prime Minister. I am surprised that his puppet adopts the same approach; I would have thought he was trying to make his own way in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lee has been notoriously slow in answering questions on notice and, in particular, correspondence. I have a number of examples of letters I have written to him over the last year which have either not been answered or which he has taken an inordinate length of time to answer. I wrote to him on 8 December 1994 making representations on behalf of the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association&mdash;no answer received to date. I wrote to him on 26 September 1994 urging him to consider including the four state opera companies in the proposed major organisations board&mdash;no answer. I wrote to him on 10 March last year requesting urgent attention and assistance on behalf of Hitz FM, a non-profit community youth radio station&mdash;again, no answer to date. I wrote to him on 7 June in relation to a large number of complaints regarding the telecommunications carrier special exemptions under the draft telecommunications national code&mdash;it took him more than four months to reply to that letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister has a long history of prior convictions for refusing to answer correspondence and for refusing to comply with requests from the committee. In those circumstances, we should treat the contact by his office with my office this afternoon as simply no more than an attempt to stall for no good reason. They have obviously had all the time in the world; they have had letters of request; the minister received a letter more than a week ago. Yet on we go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most ministers in this chamber make a reasonable effort and, if they are dilatory and are asked to explain their behaviour, then they often come in here and explain it&mdash;I suppose, mea culpa&mdash;and we accept that they are acting in good faith. I have no reason at all to think that Mr Lee is doing anything other than giving effect to the views of one of his staffers whom my office contacted some months ago and asked for information, and the reply was, `Why should we help you in any shape or form; your job is to get us.' I take that as truthfully reflecting the attitude of the office and no doubt the minister.</PARA>

You get these feeble little efforts on the part of Mr Lee to try to somehow suggest that our policy approach is not quite as good as his.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not once has Mr Lee ever landed any blow of substance. It is simply an attempt somehow to flex some very small muscles. I find it not even irritating but virtually laughable. It is a concession on Mr Lee's part that he is floundering and cannot handle the heat of the political game. At the very least, when he has a massive bureaucracy behind him, I would have thought he would be capable of responding to questions on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The summary of Senate questions on notice for 1994 also makes interesting reading. It makes the point that since Mr Lee became minister at the end of 1993, he has been asked 66 questions on notice by senators relating to the communications and arts portfolio. Of these questions he has answered a mere 10 questions within the 30-day time limit set by the Senate. Answers have taken 107 days, 156 days, 186 days, 140 days, 148 days, 106 days and 130 days&mdash;the last still remaining unanswered to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a pretty appalling track record. I would very much like to hear whether there is any explanation or justification. I have no doubt at all that Mr Lee would do a lot better if he applied his mind to these matters. Obviously he does not regard the parliamentary process as any sort of priority. I have to say that he would be one of the worst performers in that regard. The only conclusion I can come to is that he is running scared because he knows that the questions that have been put on notice will expose a number of deficiencies in his approach and will probably involve him in a lot more work as well. Well, if he wants to be paid for driving around in a big fat car, then here is his chance to earn his money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Tierney wants to get excited, if he wants to do something about his blood pressure, let him do it somewhere else. I am trying to speak about the issues that are before the Senate. The fact is that we have a person here who studiously avoided providing the facts against the background of an outrageous proposal involving a thousand questions to be answered over December and January. That task requires a huge collective administrative effort across several bodies within the communications portfolio. The minister, as do I think all responsible ministers, does not regard himself merely as a conduit of the department but rather as the person who provides the answers. I do. When answers come from the department to me, I seek within the limits of my capacity to check the answers myself. I do not just say `Here they are' and pass them on. That is the proper process. When you have a thousand, it takes a little time. As I am advised, some of them are cross-referenced. They are overlapping questions to different agencies within the department. Obviously a minister wants to make sure that those are consistent and would want to be satisfied with those answers. That is the proper thing for a minister to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to Senator Tierney's enthusiasm, my understanding is that the minister has not received all the answers as yet. He is currently examining those answers that have been forwarded. Senator Alston has acknowledged that he was advised of the minister's proposal, and his understanding is the same as mine. The minister's proposal was that, notwithstanding the mountain of material involved, some 10 per cent of the answers can be provided tomorrow&mdash;which does not sound a lot, until you realise that it is more than 100 answers&mdash;approximately 500 or more can be provided by Friday, and the remaining 500 or so can be provided by next Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate may pass a resolution that the material the minister does not have has to be supplied by tomorrow. The Senate is a very powerful body, but it cannot make things exist that do not exist. It cannot make documents be tabled that have not been provided. It is the sort of squeeze that ministers in this place get caught in from time to time. In this instance that is not the case. But in a motion of the same nature, requiring the minister to provide something that, as I understand it, has not been provided to him is a rather difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it very clear that there is no intention not to answer the questions. All the questions will be answered and they will be answered quite promptly from here. But you need to appreciate that, if you ask 1,000 questions, it will take a little longer to answer than if you had asked 100 questions. If you do not have the capacity to set priorities about the matters of which you are concerned and you seek to ask every question, then it will take longer than if you were not so slothful and set priorities and asked key questions. Most senators, and particularly most shadow ministers, take the trouble to do that. If you are slothful and say, `Here are all the questions everybody ever thought of about this issue,' it will take a while to get the answers. But to have the so-called nine weeks, including the week between Christmas and New Year, when I suspect not a lot of answers were processed&mdash;</PARA>

The Senate can pass a resolution saying that it all has to be provided by tomorrow. I am not sure what will follow from that, given that, as I understand it, the minister does not have some of the information requested. We have to calm our enthusiasm about whether or not somebody is trying to defy the Senate. We will have 1,000 answers by next Monday. If that is an unreasonable proposition, then I am sorry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator Alston on this outrageous matter of delay to answers to questions. I will deal with Senator McMullan's rather feeble excuses in a minute. What this demonstrates yet again is a curtailment of the powers for scrutiny of the Senate. In the chamber yesterday, on the Procedure Committee report, Senator Hill outlined a number of ways in which Senate power and the rights of senators to cast this government under scrutiny had been curtailed. We have here today yet another example of this in the delay in providing answers to questions. The end result of what the government has done is that the minister is now giving senators&mdash;with their very limited staff, as opposed to ministerial and departmental staff&mdash;very little time to actually look at these answers and work out responses to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I came into this place four years ago, we have witnessed&mdash;in addition to this curtailment of senators' rights, as Senator Hill said yesterday&mdash;changes in hours. We have seen changes in the amount of time senators can speak. We see increasingly, particularly since we have changed Presidents of the Senate, the rights of senators in this place to ask questions and to have matters taken note of in response to points of order severely curtailed. This has given the government a free run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great dangers to parliamentary democracy is the fact that we have in our system a tendency towards centralisation. You have the executive arm of government having an increasing amount of power. It leaves the members of parliament fighting battles on two fronts. First of all we have to try to get the government to come clean and to give us honest answers in this chamber. But then we have to fight on a second front against public servants who will not come up with straight answers to questions in estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many examples during the time Senator Alston and I were looking at the matter of the ABC. Senior public servants would sit there, go round and round in circles and never give you a straight answer. I asked the head of a department, when we were at a dinner in Canberra, about this and why we could not get a straight answer out of the Public Service. He said, `You've got to ask the right question.' In other words, we that are generalists are not experts. They are the public servants. They know what we are getting at. They know the answer. Instead of coming clean and saying, `Look, this is the situation. We'll give you the true and full picture,' what tends to happen is that they sit back and wait. If we do not ask the precise question that gets to the exact point, they will try to skirt around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an example with the ABC and its core activities and its non-core activities. I asked the secretary to the department seven questions before I got him to admit that, on the ATV matter, if their debt kept blowing out and the government really decided in the end that it would not continue with that activity, the money would not come as a supplement out of the Department of Finance but it would have to be met out of ABC funds&mdash;in other words, out of core activities. He did not say that up-front at first; it took about seven questions before we got to an answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan made much of the fact that there are 1,000 questions. What Senator McMullan is forgetting is that there are about 10 different departments and agencies in this area of communications and the arts. That averages out at about 100 questions an agency. I would have thought that, with these areas of government that have massive resources, answering 100 questions was not beyond them. The sorts of questions we put on notice tend to be ones which require factual information and should be easily found in government documents and other reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem here was not that they did not have enough time. They obviously had enough time because, even with Christmas, these matters have been on the minister's desk for some time. Senator McMullan said that they are not all answered, and that is probably right. But why has he spent quite a lot of time just sitting on those matters and not passing them through to senators' offices? In the end, he is putting us in a position where we do not have proper time for scrutiny. That is a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the area under consideration is the Department of Communications and the Arts. This is one of the crucial areas in the future development of Australia. We have had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) bring out a special policy and special budgetary supplementation to really help kick us off in areas like the information superhighway. For example, in the United States seven per cent of GDP is now in the communications industry. It is a large part of the future growth of Australia and the health of our economy is going to depend largely on developments in this area; yet constantly there are problems. Last year we had the example of pay television. The responsible minister at the time, Senator Collins, absolutely messed up the pay TV arrangements because he did not read documents. We had a major inquiry and an internal inquiry into the operations of the department and found that they were grossly deficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking past the central department to the various agencies, like the ABC, our recent inquiries show a huge number of problems there also. When we asked the departmental head, `How does this area come under scrutiny on behalf of the public?,' he said, `The Auditor-General looks at it.' That is fine up to a point. That will do something to look at the financial management of the institution, but it does not look at what it is actually doing in terms of fulfilling a charter, for example. There needs to be far greater scrutiny in this area because these agencies are not just parts of the Public Service; they are statutory corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here with massive areas of public investment. We are dealing with the ABC, which has over half a billion a year, Telecom, which actually makes a profit of $1 1/2 billion a year, and a range of other agencies in telecommunications, culture and the arts. There are a lot of areas that need scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these matters come before this parliament, the parliament is treated in a very shabby way, not only through the estimates process but also by the reports of this department. Senator Alston will recall that on one day at the end of last year, 11 reports in the communications and the arts area were presented on one day. As senators are aware, the Senate has half an hour to consider these reports&mdash;five minutes for each speaker. That means that six senators can speak. Even if everyone wanted to speak on communications, we would not get through half of the report. We are competing for time with every other department's report as well. I think on that day there were about 38 different reports to be considered. This is yet another example of this government's trying to avoid scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not be doing that in this particular case. It has had the material since the end of November. It has had eight weeks to look at it. Some of this material has been sitting on the minister's desk for up to two weeks, I believe. This government stands condemned for yet again trying to avoid the scrutiny of the people's representatives in the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From Senator Margetts. And we were supposed to go away and try to address those questions seriously. That was very hard. Unless we accepted all the assumptions in the questions on notice, we found it very hard to answer them other than in a desultory way, which we do not want to do. We want to give correct and proper answers. But if the questions are prejudicial, are not based on fact, are based on guess work or are misunderstanding of the budget process, it is very hard to answer them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second very difficult area is that of historical questions, which we are getting more of. That is where you do not ask about what the department has done in the last year but ask us to go back and research five to eight years. My attitude is that if that process is too complex and it costs too much money, I will not do it. I will say, `This costs too many resources to attempt to do because it is not relevant to the current year's expenditure.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next hurdle that often delays answers is that of answers having to be cleared through the relevant minister. No-one in this chamber would suggest that you send the questions across to the department, bring the answers back and send them straight to the committee without looking at and checking the answers, because sometimes departments make mistakes. Sometimes you are able to pick up those mistakes and have them corrected in the answer. Sometimes a few slip through, but most people cut a bit of slack there and understand that no-one is perfect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the point of cost. There is a view,  I think, amongst some senators that you can put hundreds of questions on notice and that there is no cost in answering them. Last year I costed the activities of one senator in relation to putting questions on notice. It went well into five figures. This year someone is going to pass that by a mile. That is a cost to departments. It is a cost of effort. It does divert officers sometimes. So a lot does go back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the nature of the questions? They usually fall into two areas. Some are Senator Alston or Senator Tierney seeking information to help them in their public life&mdash;that often happens&mdash;and some are simply a trawling exercise. Questioners throw the long line out to see what they can hook. They might ask 500 questions and get one fish on the end. That still has a cost to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that here we are dealing with additional estimates. Ministers have been very liberal in their interpretation of the questions they have been asked, but all have tried to answer them in one form or another, at the committee or elsewhere. But this is additional estimates. The questions should be to do with the additional money being spent only. Yet if you go back and have a look at the questions asked at the estimates committee and by way of notice&mdash;I am only guessing now, but I bet I cannot be proved wrong&mdash;you will see that quite a few of these 1,200 questions are not to do with additional estimates&mdash;</PARA>

Those opposite don't know and I don't expect them to respond, but would I be wrong in guessing at least 50 per cent were not on the additional estimates process? Nevertheless, in the tradition of flexibility of this place, ministers try to get answers because if they do not do it this time they will probably get asked next time. So why not do it?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, when John Hewson went to the last election, one of his great pleas was, `Give us a Senate majority.' All those points of interference that you call scrutiny and I often call scrutiny are sometimes just plain, blatant political interference. You do not want it done to you. You want a fair run. That is one of the reasons, when you did get the majority to increase the powers of the Senate, we put it in standing orders rather than sessional orders&mdash;so that you people could not ignore it the moment you won government, because that was your intention. You always go soft on Senate procedure, powers of the Senate, powers of committees and all the rest of it close to an election. You always go soft on it. I have seen that from Senator Hill and former Senator Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put one other matter on the record. If, in fact, this Senate puts timetables on answers, it may well affect the quality of the answers, for one reason and one reason only. I want to take you back three years when this happened to me as Minister for Defence. We were asked a question, I think on notice, about asbestosis. It is a fact in the navy. An officer of my department went to a lot of trouble to prepare an answer. He did not, however, check the records back to 1942 when this was first mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of your colleagues came in here and had him referred to the Privileges Committee for misleading the Senate. This chamber carried the motion to refer that employee of the Department of Defence, doing his job, trying to get the answer right, to the Privileges Committee. We had a debate on that but no-one listened. Everyone made up their mind beforehand. When the Privileges Committee looked at the issue, of course it found absolutely no guilt and dismissed the charge against him. The point I want to make is that, if you have deadlines and you rush public servants&mdash;I am not saying in this case&mdash;and you rush answers and then you do not like the answers, you should not take the poor officer to the Privileges Committee. It is just not fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that governments have to go through the process of estimates committees. Whilst none of us like it at times because of its irrelevancy and, on occasions, its stupidity, it is still a good committee process of accountability. There is no question about that. It is probably the best process in government, along with the Auditor-General, so we do not want to knock the chocks from under it in any particular way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to finish on is that the process of answering questions on notice should be complied with where it is practical. There is no dispute on our side on that. There is no dispute whatsoever. For those who say that this is an absolutely simple process of putting a thousand questions in and getting a thousand answers out the other side, the deadline that you set cannot always be met, depending on the complexity of the questions and what the questions go to. We, on this side, believe we should try to get those answers in as quickly as possible because I think it suits our own self-interest to do so rather than having all the material regurgitated at the supplementary hearings. It is not always possible in every circumstance to get every question answered in a timetable that suits you. It is simply not possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Ray for his contribution because in more than 10 minutes I do not think he, in any shape or form, attempted to argue against the merits of this particular case. I will just deal with a number of the points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, Senator Ray, that if you were genuine&mdash;and you purported to be genuine&mdash;about the desirability of answering questions, if you were fair dinkum, you would demonstrate your bona fides by providing answers progressively. You have had 70 days to answer a lot of questions from 10 different senators. If you were serious, when you were written to by the committee, as you were seven or eight days ago, you would have written back and said, `Well, the fact is to date I've had a lot of questions. I've managed to get through two-thirds of them. Some of them are still requiring further information, but this is what I have got to date and you can have that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I suspect the real reason why we have not got any answers at all is that Ken was overseas for the whole of January swanning around Europe. Of course, if he only got back at the beginning of last week, he did not give himself much of a chance to deal with what, no doubt, he would regard as a low order of priority. So, completely of his own making, he finds that he has all these questions piled up in his office and, because he prefers to run around Europe on vacation, he has not had time to do the work. Again, if he were genuine about all of this, he would have written back and explained where we were in the process and not come up with possible explanations transmitted through Senator McMullan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ray rightly said, one cannot hold Senator McMullan personally at fault in this exercise because, quite clearly, it is not Senator McMullan's fault. Senator McMullan is here responding on behalf of Mr Lee. That is where the blame resides. It was quite open to Senator McMullan to transmit a message from Mr Lee's office that, indeed, a number of these questions were fishing, vexatious, frivolous, irrelevant. All sorts of objections involved an enormous volume of resources and covered historical matters. We could have had all of that. If you were serious and genuine, you could have come in here and given us those sorts of reasons why it had not been possible. But we did not hear one word along those lines. There has been no attempt to suggest that the government has had problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ray says, it is desirable to get answers as quickly as possible. It is not possible to get all the questions in time. We have not had any questions at all, so you have to ask yourself: what is going on here? I think one explanation is that the minister has been too busy. He put his personal preferences, going to the other end of the world, ahead of his parliamentary responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, as you would know if you have been around this place for any length of time, there is also the other very transparent and utterly predictable strategy behind all this. I just noticed it on the ABC committee, for example. We have put down questions on notice, and each and every time those answers turn up a couple of hours before we are about to start the hearing. It is the oldest bureaucratic trick in the book. Quite clearly, Minister Lee has decided that he will deliver only half the answers to these questions from a range of senators. They have to go through them immediately on Monday, irrespective of what other commitments they might have, and, by the close of business on Monday, communicate to the secretary of the committee whether they have any further questions arising. Clearly, they have to consider all of those answers and their adequacy in a matter of a couple of hours on the Monday before they can then indicate, as they are entitled and indeed required to do, whether they want to take the matters further. It is a pretty transparent ploy, I would have thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have had 70 days to provide answers. You have provided none. You did not even, in response to the minister's letter, attempt to contact my office, for example, and provide any sort of explanation or attempt any sort of negotiations. You rang up about lunchtime, knowing it was coming on after question time, and you put forward this proposition: `It is all very demanding and we can't possibly comply. Here is our offer.' It is not much more than an ambit claim. It is not much more than pretty grubby, bureaucratic politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not blame Senator McMullan personally for this, although I would not like to say that he would be above doing that because I think it is pretty much standard practice on the other side that, wherever possible, they give the opposition as little time as possible within the general rules. That is what I think is going on here. This is a conscious and deliberate attempt to squeeze the process to the very end in order to minimise the amount of extra work. As I say, if we had received a number of these answers to date or if there had been any attempt to indicate that somehow the questions were unfair, too demanding or simply covering utterly inappropriate ground, one might have thought that we would have heard of that by now or during the course of Senator McMullan's response&mdash;but we have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think there are only two conclusions we can come to: firstly, that the minister, by his own actions and in choosing to be out of the country for about six weeks, has put himself in a difficult position; but secondly, and most importantly, he has made no attempts since that time&mdash;and I suppose he could have had the material faxed to him on the ski slopes or wherever he was, but he has not even done that&mdash;to come up with anything except simply an eleventh hour proposition which is very much along the usual lines of trying to put maximum pressure on. In those circumstances, I hope that the Senate will carry this motion in order to demonstrate that we do expect ministers to comply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say one thing finally: what we are asking is that the minister comply with a resolution of the legislation committee of 23 January. That committee had a majority of government members on it; in other words, they all took the view that the minister had had ample time to answer the questions&mdash;and he has chosen not to. He has made no attempt, since 23 January, to come up with any of the answers. All he has done is wait until five minutes to midnight to come up with some sort of feeble tactical response. That is not good enough. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">its stated roles and functions are predominantly administrative in nature, its operations are not subject to the scrutiny normally associated with the expenditure of public money.</PARA>
<PARA>In a sense, the government has conceded that this is a real problem in relation to the National Media Liaison Service because we read in paragraph 1.7 of the Auditor-General's report that it is expected that agencies such as the National Media Liaison Service will be covered under the new Audit Act in the regulations which will be brought before this chamber. The first point I would make is that we have a government agency&mdash;the National Media Liaison Service&mdash;which, according to the Crown Law Department, is not subject to the normal efficiency audits one would expect to be carried out on an agency disposing of such a large amount of government money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next step in this history relates to the estimates committee hearings which were held last Friday and at which Senator McMullan attended. I gave ample notice that I wished to ask some questions about the activities of the National Media Liaison Service. These questions had been asked before. Indeed, the Director of the National Media Liaison Service had, in the past, appeared before this committee. I have previously quoted an instance when in 1989 Mr Colin Parks was prepared to come before this committee and answer questions. I repeat: I gave ample notice that I wished to proceed and ask some questions relating to the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the committee resumed on Friday, Senator McMullan was sent in to open the batting. He said that the questions which I put to him should all be put on notice. Of course, this is quite contrary, Senator McMullan, to the very line that Senator Ray was putting to this chamber just some minutes ago as to how governments attempt to respond to questions rapidly and accurately, and how much better it is that those questions are put to the estimates hearing directly rather than on notice. So I played by the rules of the game, Senator McMullan. I indicated that I wished to ask these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan comes along and presents a letter from Mr Beazley which, in short, indicates that the Director of the National Media Liaison Service, Mr David Epstein, is not to appear before the committee. What is the result of this? I asked a series of straightforward questions of Senator McMullan: what is the budget of the National Media Liaison Service? Senator McMullan, `Put it on notice'; what are the objectives of the National Media Liaison Service? Senator McMullan, `Put it on notice'. So it proceeded. It was a total and absolute farce and it continued for over an hour. Senator McMullan was clearly pursuing a strategy, which had been worked out with Mr David Epstein and Mr Beazley, that no questions would be answered; these questions would be put on notice and carefully vetted before any response was given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a real problem here. It attempts to justify the expenditure of $1.5 million of taxpayers' money for a government information unit. The purpose of that unit, as set out in the material tabled some years ago by Senator Bolkus, is that it provides accurate and timely information on government policies. That is how the government attempts to justify the employment of 23 officers of the National Media Liaison Service; their job is to provide information on government policies. In fact, there is a sensitivity that somehow this unit should not be used for party political purposes; in other words, the $1.5 million is to be provided in order to promote government policies and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item (d) on the roles and function of the National Media Liaison Service states that `representatives will not work with local or state party branches'&mdash;and I stress this&mdash;`and will not be involved in party programs, nor electoral campaigning'. The government is careful to distinguish between the role of the National Media Liaison Service and the more political role that ministerial staff often perform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government justifies spending $1.5 million on a unit of 23 officers in order that this unit can promote government policies and programs. But when the Auditor-General tries to assess the work and performance of this unit&mdash;along with various other bodies that carry out government information and advertising programs&mdash;the walls are put up. Then when the Senate estimates committee appropriately seeks to ask questions about the role of this unit, again we have stonewalling and Mr David Epstein gets a note from the teacher saying that he does not have to appear. The government attempts to justify the $1.5 million spent on government information programs, then it hides behind the fact that Mr Epstein and his colleagues are employed under the MOPS Act and, therefore, according to Mr Beazley, are not subject to questions by the Senate committee. The government is trying to have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is this: if the government said, `We employ 23 officers at $1.5 million, and their job is to carry out political work on behalf of the government doing research on the opposition and putting out material on the opposition,' the government would have to provide Senator Kernot and the opposition with additional staff to do similar work. But, of course, it does not want to do that; therefore, it says that this is a government information program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government has been comprehensively caught out here. This does not establish any precedent that ministerial staff will be called before Senate committees. I give that assurance to Senator McMullan. This says that, if a government sets up an agency to carry out work on promoting government programs and policies, that is what it should do. We are entitled in this chamber, therefore, to assess how that work is being carried out, as is the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What everybody in this parliament knows&mdash;with the sole exception of Senator McMullan when he appeared before the estimates committee last Friday&mdash;is that Mr David Epstein is not carrying out the function which is specified and which taxpayer dollars are being provided for. Mr Epstein is carrying out altogether a different function and directing his staff&mdash;I suspect, therefore, improperly&mdash;to carry out an alternative function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise it briefly, this unit is a political hit-squad. We understand from the media that much of its work is designed to carry out research and analysis of the political opponents of the government&mdash;the Greens, the Democrats and the coalition. That is the dilemma that the government now has. It has justified spending $1.5 million and justified employing 23 officers right around Australia on the basis that they are carrying out work to promote government programs and policies. That is why this Senate committee is perfectly entitled to ask questions about the work of this unit, and that is why this Senate committee is perfectly entitled under our standing orders to summon Mr David Epstein to appear before the committee to answer these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no precedent being established here&mdash;except the precedent of accountability. That is the precedent which is being set, and the Auditor-General has indicated that there is a major loophole in that area. As I said before, this unit is justified by the government as being an information unit on government programs and policies. The government attempts to make it clear in the guidelines governing this unit that it is not to involve itself in political work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that, when Mr Epstein appears before this committee, Senator McMullan should be there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the roles and functions of the National Media Liaison Service, item (d) says that representatives of the unit `will not be involved in party programs, nor electoral campaigning'. The sort of question that the Senate committee wanted to ask Mr Epstein was whether he was involved in any way during the last election campaign. That is a fair enough question. You justified spending the money on the basis that he and his 23 officers would not be involved. We are entitled to see what sort of work Mr David Epstein and his colleagues carry out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is on the horns of a great dilemma here. It justifies spending $1.5 million on the grounds that this is a unit to promote government information and government programs. Then when we seek to inquire what Mr Epstein and his colleagues are doing in carrying out that work, the government suddenly ducks for cover and runs behind the MOPS Act. If Senator McMullan wants to be frank and say, `Mr Epstein and his colleagues are really doing party political work and the work of ministerial staff,' that is all right. You say that, but then the problem is that you have to justify why you should have additional staff for political work, and the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens are not granted a similar facility. That is your problem. </PARA>

Perhaps you do not know that, Senator Abetz, but Senator Kemp does. The fact is that some important questions have been raised. I do not deny that. The audit office is an important principle of our system of accountability, as is the parliament and the estimates committee system. Both those things are true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For anyone who is listening to this debate or who subsequently reads it, let us get one thing clear: the normal financial audits that apply to the proper expenditure of taxpayers' money to ensure that there are no misappropriations do apply, and always have applied, to the expenditure of this money. What we are talking about is whether the current law allows a performance audit of the National Media Liaison Service to be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of a ministerial edict saying it should not be conducted. The advice of the Attorney-General's Department is that it is ultra vires the act as it now stands. If the Senate does not like that, then it is open to it to deal with the legislation when it comes before it, as it is about to do as we all know, to ensure that that problem no longer exists. I do not want to get into the question of interpretation as to whether the bill, as it is now drafted, does do that. That is another question. If it does do that, you can keep it as it is and if you are worried it does not do that, then you can amend it. The proper processes exist for dealing with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enthusiasm of the opposition for performance audits of bodies such as this was not evident in the days of the Government Information Unit which it ran when it was in office at a much greater cost to the taxpayer, and which displayed not only blatant evidence of its partisan activities generally but also blatant evidence of its partisan and active activities within the Liberal Party. This was properly more of a problem for the then member for Kooyong than it was for us at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are the constraints that set down the role and function of the NMLS phrased as carefully as they are? We learnt the lesson of the abuses conducted by the Government Information Unit under the Fraser government which operated at a much greater real dollar cost to the taxpayer than the NMLS has ever cost. Is that ever acknowledged? No. Was the opposition ever enthusiastic about questions of accountability then? No. Let us not have any of that humbug. If the question of a performance audit of a body such as this is appropriate&mdash;I will come to my view about the appropriateness of at least some part of it later&mdash;then the legislative route is the way to go and we will, by 1 July this year, have in place a process to resolve that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: should the Senate resolve to require a ministerial employee to appear before a Senate committee, and where might that slippery slope lead us? It is not a question of whether the government is prepared to answer questions about NMLS. It may be frustrating for Senator Kemp, Senator Abetz and others to have to get their information on notice, but get it they will. It will be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will get the information that it has sought and, to the extent that it is within my power&mdash;and whatever you might think of my other performances, I think in this area my record is okay&mdash;it will be as prompt as I can make it. I am not the minister directly responsible, but it will be as prompt as I can make it. Notwithstanding previous resolutions, I am pretty happy to stand on that record. I will seek to get that as promptly as I can. I hope to be able to provide you with the information on those things that you asked for on Friday very soon. I do not know whether it will be all of it because I have not checked the list&mdash;I will do that before I send it&mdash;but certainly you will get a substantial amount of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are other matters that arise from that and you want to get some more information, I will seek to supply it as promptly as I can. It is not a question of whether I, as the minister representing the minister responsible, should have to provide the information. It is a question of the accountability of ministers to this parliament, which I will seek to uphold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who comes to assist me in the provision of that information? If you want to ask questions about the behaviour of people within the department, you might have to put them on notice. The information can be provided without calling a member of ministerial staff before the committee. In my view, ministerial staff are accountable to the minister and the minister is accountable to the parliament and, ultimately, the electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is how the performance audit is conducted on all of us. The performance audit of all of us is conducted by the voters, and so it should be. That is the way the representative democratIndustry Commission system operates. Ministerial staff are accountable to ministers, who are accountable to the parliament and, ultimately, you are not a minister if you do not get the support of electors. There is nothing special about ministers. It can equally apply to anybody employed by the opposition, minor parties, government backbenchers or ministers. This is a matter to which this parliament should give serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that Mr Epstein is not only the Director of the National Media Liaison Service but also&mdash;I do not have his title clear, but I will happily provide it because it is no big secret&mdash;the head of the Ministerial Media Group. He is the head of the Ministerial Media Group which is a very straightforward ministerial staff function, not dissimilar to that function conducted by any member of parliamentary, ministerial, opposition frontbencher or parliamentary office holder staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the issues? The first issue is: should there be a performance audit of functions conducted by people under the MOPS Act? My view is that there should not be. I am not sure whether that is the view of the government. I think it is getting the accountability equation back to front because it means that you can then have the executive scrutinising the parliament. It is not supposed to work that way. The government could have a performance audit of the opposition. That is absurd in my view. The outcome might be absurd too, but that is another question. That was not my point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a wrong principle. I think that you should not make that decision. I think you should think very soberly about that. It does not matter what you think about me, David Epstein or the NMLS; I do not think you should make that decision. If you do think there should be performance audits of ministerial staff, then you should fix up the legislation to ensure that that occurs. Secondly, I do not think the performance audit issue arises here. Nothing in this motion will resolve it even if you are concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we need to ask whether the parliament is entitled to information about actions taken at ministerial direction and the spending of taxpayers' money within the normal parameters of the things that governments have never answered such as cabinet-in-confidence matters and all those sorts of things. I am not trying to create a new principle here. The answer is obviously yes. To the extent that I can&mdash;often on notice&mdash;that information will be provided to the committee. As I said, that was done last Friday and we will seek to do it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we should proceed to create what Senator Kemp may not intend as a precedent. I do not impute a motive to him beyond that which he has said. But it clearly will be a precedent some day, some time, in a way that causes serious problems for the parliament and its relationship with the executive. In a sense, it will probably enhance the executive vis-a-vis the parliament, but I am not sure that it will do that in the way that it should. It may enhance the position of the government vis-a-vis the opposition, but I am not sure that it will do that in the way that it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say that this is not a step you should take on some sort of whimsy or because you think open government sounds nice and sounds like it ought to happen. The information should be supplied within the normal caveats we have always had. As I said, I am not trying to erect new ones or take down the old ones. I am working within the standard procedures of what is supplied and what is not. The question we need to ask is: who should be called before the parliament to supply it? I do not think this is the appropriate course of action, and I hope that the Senate chooses not to take it. </PARA>

I also wondered what questions about expenditure he wants to ask. I heard him say towards the end of his remarks that he would like to ask whether Mr Epstein was involved in an election campaign, et cetera.

As I understand it, the NMLS will be deemed to be part of a department for audit purposes. So I guess that for the future his concern is taken care of.

I agree with Senator McMullan's observation that Senator Kemp was at pains to repeat it so many times that it has become a point of sensitivity. I know that I raised it with him myself. We should be careful about this. I know Senator Abetz interjected that Mr Parks has appeared previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator McMullan alluded to, there is the problem of the parliament and its relationship to the executive. We usually talk about our desire to question the executive, which is a legitimate function of the parliament. However, I point out to the government that it does not seem to have taken any action on the Pearce report, when we looked into the processes surrounding the allocation of tenders for pay television  licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I remember so clearly from that report is the questions raised about the demarcation of responsibility between ministerial staffers and public servants working in the department. It is a very grey area. It is something that this government needs to address in terms of structural reform. That may be the way out of the dilemma we have whereby the government is saying that the National Media Liaison Service provides a service to government while other members of the Senate are saying that it seems to be serving a party political purpose in that ministerial staff cannot be required to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the way forward is some sort of restructuring from the government and some sort of demarcation and delineation of the purpose of both these groups. I personally think it is very legitimate to follow public comment about matters under ministerial portfolios. Ministers have a legitimate entitlement to know what is being said. Other senators have made a distinction between that sort of activity and party activities being funded through taxpayer money. Senator Kemp wants to ask questions about the NMLS role in the last election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we have to ask whether reconvening the estimates committee is legitimate. Does Senator Kemp have hundreds of questions?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief contribution to this debate. I will commence by commenting on the analogy used by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) when he referred to the road that we are going down in relation to this motion as being a slippery slope. The National Media Liaison Service is suffering from the greasy pig syndrome. You think you have caught it, but each time it slips out of your hands. We are dealing with a greasy pig rather than a slippery slope.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Robert Ray so eloquently put it to the Senate in the previous debate, the Senate estimates committee and the Auditor-General are two key elements of accountability by the executive to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the people of Australia. He spoke somewhat condescendingly. Nevertheless, he made the points very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the history of the National Media Liaison Service, commonly referred to as aNiMaLS, we as an opposition have been trying to get information. First of all, the Auditor-General independently sought to make an investigation into efficiency. He was blocked by the minister. Whilst I accept that the legal opinion was that it was ultra vires, the simple fact is that nothing was stopping the minister from saying, `Although there is a legal technicality, we welcome the Auditor-General looking at the performance of the National Media Liaison Service as part of our overall review in the particular area of government advertising.' So the government took the particular decision not to allow the Auditor-General in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the next step? The next step was the estimates committee. Senator McMullan's performance on Friday was, with due respect, not too flash. Most of the questions were answered by `I will put it on notice' or `I have no idea'; basically we were given non-responses. That was very frustrating, especially when we heard in the previous debate a senior minister, Senator Robert Ray, indicating how he seeks to instruct his department to give open and full answers at the actual hearing. There seems to be a different standard applied by the government in relation to the Department of Defence under Senator Ray from that applied in relation to the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being a suspicious opposition, I think it is appropriate for us to ask why Senator Ray adopts such an open attitude to the Department of Defence at estimates committees but the minister responsible, Senator McMullan, seems to have taken a bunker mentality in relation to answering questions about the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>

It is therefore unfortunate that this matter has to come before the parliament and before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to you, Minister, that if you are concerned about the dangerous precedent that is being set&mdash;I have to say that I accept what Senator Kernot said and it is a very dangerous precedent&mdash;the interesting thing is that a precedent has been set previously; namely, by Mr Colin Parks, who appeared before the Senate estimates committee voluntarily. If you were to have followed that precedent, there would have been no need for this motion before the Senate today. One can only ask the question: why is it that you did not want Mr Epstein to follow the precedent set by one of his predecessors, Mr Colin Parks?</PARA>

It seems strange that the minister did not want to get in to that area of debate to justify that this is an area where public moneys are being well spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that this question is one of accountability and it is an area that clearly ought to be dealt with by this Senate. Albeit, it might be setting a dangerous precedent but that was as a result of the minister and the government taking decisions not to allow the Auditor-General in and trying to frustrate the Senate estimates committee process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1330 standing in the name of Senator Ian Macdonald for this day, relating to an order for the production of documents by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) concerning the assessment of forest coupes.</PARA>
<PARA>I speak a little uncertainly because I am not quite sure exactly how this motion will be dealt with by the different parties. The Labor Party is obviously totally opposed to it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why I sought that information was based on last week's statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

<PARA>So on 2 February Mr Keating said that next week the government would start looking at each individual coupe.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I can reasonably take that matter too much further except to say that I think it is important in this whole debate that there be as much transparency as possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned by the way the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and his department are handling this whole process. In an exchange that occurred relative to this same matter but on Senator Faulkner tabling documents which were demanded by the Senate in a previous return to order, Senator Faulkner clearly advised on 2 December at the time he tabled the contracts&mdash;if I could put my hand on the transcript I would quote it, but I cannot; I showed Senator Faulkner and also Senator Bell the transcript of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> where Senator Faulkner indicated this&mdash;that all relevant and contractual acquittal processes had been complied with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner then privately indicated to me that he was prepared to make that information available when he got it. He said&mdash;and he also said this on the public record&mdash;that now was not the time because the time by which that acquittal report had to be tabled had not yet arrived. Senator Faulkner wittingly or unwittingly&mdash;I give him the benefit of the doubt by saying `unwittingly'&mdash;has misled the Senate. For misleading the Senate, he should take the honourable course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, not only did you on 2 February 1995 say that all relevant acquittal obligations set out in the contracts have been complied with; today you said the time has not arrived. Senator, if you or your advisers would care to have a look at the contracts, I will take you through them to show you that the time in fact has arrived. On that basis, that acquittal report should be here. You have misled the Senate by saying the time has not arrived. It makes one wonder what the purpose of this exercise is if the Senate instructs Senator Faulkner to table some reports and then he is not prepared to comply with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator, so that in the cooler light of day you or your advisers can follow this through&mdash;although you have not been well treated by your advisers so far&mdash;the contract in clause 2.4(c) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A final coordinated report must be given at the end of the seventh week or by 4 November 1994, whichever is the sooner.</PARA>
<PARA>The relevant date for the final coordinated report is 4 November 1994. The final instalment of the payments to the contractors, to the conservation councils in this instance of $3,818, was to be paid on the completion of the contract. I would suggest that that is probably being paid on 4 November. Elsewhere in the contract it is made quite clear that the project has to be completed on delivery, and there must be written acceptance of a satisfactory report no later than seven weeks from the date of receipt of certain material from the department or no later than 4 November, whichever is the sooner. Again, this report had to be completed by 4 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5.3 of the contract says that within eight weeks of the completion of the project, or some other happenings, the grantee shall repay all unexpended grant moneys and provide an acquittal report to the department. The contract makes it quite clear that the completion of the project is no later than 4 November. Eight weeks from 4 November has certainly passed by now. It coincides with the advice that Senator Faulkner was given and which he mentioned to us on 2 February when he said that the four organisations have complied with all relevant acquittal obligations set out in the contract. Now he is telling me and the Senate that those acquittal reports are not here. Either Senator Faulkner is lying or these people have not complied with the contracts. In that event, I want to know why. Over $100,000 of taxpayers' money has been paid to four conservation groups to put in these assessments. We want to see, as custodians of the taxpayers' money, what we got for that $100,000 and who was the recipient of all the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was flabbergasted in question time today when Senator Faulkner said that a lot of the information that these conservation groups provided in those reports was from a database. If it was from a database or from state conservation departments, why, Senator, didn't your department do that, at a very minimal cost, rather than pay these conservation groups $100,000-plus of taxpayers' money to do what your department could have done&mdash;simply call up the database of the state forestry and conservation departments&mdash;to get the information?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator, this web is a very tangled one that you and your department seem to have tried to create, but it is coming untangled very fast. It is becoming a matter of major scandal about what happened to that $100,000; what we as taxpayers got for that money; and why you cannot produce the acquittal report, which was supposed to be in by no later than 4 January 1995 and which, in spite of an order of this Senate to table the report, you tell me today you cannot table because the time has not arrived. The time has arrived, and you should table those acquittal reports if you have them. If you have not got them, you and your department are derelict in your duty by not enforcing those contracts and making sure that those people who received over $100,000 of taxpayers' money account to us for what they did for the money that was paid to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Senator Faulkner will curtail further more drastic action in the next couple of days of the Senate by explaining those things tonight. I can assure him that, unless we get a decent explanation on why those acquittal reports are not here, we will be bringing Senator Faulkner to account for his misleading of the Senate and for his incompetence and dereliction of duty in not enforcing the terms of those contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning more directly to the motion before us, I again say to my colleagues in the other parties and groups in the Senate that the information on which coupes Mr Keating was referring to on 2 February&mdash;when he said that they were going to be assessed by cabinet in this current week&mdash;is important. We, as well as members of the cabinet, have the right to know which coupes he is talking about. It is obvious that on 2 February 1995 Mr Keating knew which coupes they were.

Alternatively, I would hope that Senator Bell might realise that by agreeing to the motion he is not putting the government to any particularly onerous task. It is information that the Prime Minister had on 2 February and should be available to us. It takes no-one backwards a step, except perhaps the Labor Party; perhaps it would make it look even more foolish and incompetent in its handling of this matter. In the real interests of the forest industry people and environmentalists, it is important that we are all let into the secret. I urge the Democrats and the minor parties to concede the motion so that we can get that information before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I sought your call at this early stage because I could see that Senator Macdonald was racked with anxiety and trouble about the direction of this motion. I hope to relieve some of that tension that he is suffering from. While I would not in any way seek to shelter the government from the scrutiny brought by this motion in its initial format, I share Senator Chamarette's concern that the date is a little hasty and that an amendment to seek a later date would place this motion to a closer representation of what it in fact is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriately a question on notice. It is not a return to order, which is a device for the discovery of an existing document or documents. This motion is asking for the creation of documents or for the compilation or collation of existing documents into a format which is being asked for by the mover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things are normally done by way of questions upon notice and such a process allows fair time for such a collation. In fact, the Democrats have several motions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> at present seeking specific information but which allow sufficient time for an accurate answer to be given. That is as it should be if we seek to attach accountability to the government. We regularly follow that process as well as the process involving questions on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering Senator Ian Macdonald's motion, we looked at whether it was an appropriate device for following matters in this chamber compared with other notices of motion. We have to be very careful in this regard. The purpose was to seek to bring the government to account. Often senators compete in the process of setting down notices of motion. Such competition is healthy but it is important that there be no unnecessary duplication. It is possible to see this motion as a subset of the information sought in Senator Gibson's notice of motion 1315 which asked for all documents relating to the granting of export woodchip licences. That motion was slightly amended before it was passed. It now seeks only to obtain those documents which were exchanged with the Prime Minister. Perhaps the coalition realised that a number of notices of motion were chasing the same rabbit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Ian Macdonald in asking for as much transparency as possible in the process. Having taken a careful look at this matter, the Democrats argue strongly that the whole process should be examined by way of an inquiry by a senate standing committee. We envisage that inquiry should be comprehensive and fully targeted at the process which took place&mdash;a process which in turn delivered the shemozzle that took place outside this Parliament in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that an inquiry fully targeted at that process should include examination of all relevant documents. We feel that it should neither duplicate nor omit any information that is necessary to deliver a process that will not continue the annual circus. Such a process has been rightly criticised by the industry, commentators, conservation groups and, most effectively, I believe, by the Democrats&mdash;indeed by all except government apologists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion will return some of the information asked for. I understand that Senator Chamarette will be suggesting another date, which we will support. If we are able to support such a proposal, I feel that it would allow proper compilation of the information sought and therefore would have a greater chance of being accurate. We give our reluctant support to this, recognising that it would be inferior to the setting up of a full inquiry into the process. </PARA>

Obviously the Greens WA support openness and accountability by the government, and particularly in this matter which is of very great concern to us.

We have no desire to rush the rapid assessment process in such a way as to hinder or jeopardise its proper operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bell has said, this motion requests not only a document that exists but seeks the creation of such a document. As to the three conditions sought by Senator Macdonald, I believe that one is impossible of fulfilment until the whole assessment process is complete. To know which of the 509 coupes identified for priority attention are currently being logged in accordance with licence conditions, obviously those coupes have to be visited and listed in terms of current activities. It is a chicken and egg situation; it does not concern a list that simply exists. We can undertake the other two conditions within Senator Ian Macdonald's motion without necessarily making that assessment because those issues are simply matters of fact. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the other issue raised by Senator Ian Macdonald, I have made two comments in regard to acquittals. One related to a tabling statement in response to a return to order.

On 6 February I also made a comment which may have been in answer to a question without notice. I said:</PARA>

<PARA>I have been advised by the department on this matter that it is completely the standard practice for the department to consider the project completed when the report provided complies with the standards set out in the contract. So that is not when the report is delivered. The acceptance of the report as satisfactory is signified by the department making the final payment. Therefore, the eight-week period from the completion of the project is from that date when the final payment is made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Information has been passed by Senator Ian Macdonald to those of us who have participated in the debate. I indicate to Senator Macdonald that it confirms the position the Democrats have taken on this. Senator Macdonald highlighted the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he said, `Priority attention will be given to resolving the status of those coupes which meet all three of the following conditions'. I would have thought it was quite clear that if priority attention is being given to resolving something, then it has not been resolved and the list does not yet exist. That was the central part of my concerns when I made my speech about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A return to order is essentially a discovery of an existing document. The Prime Minister is saying that it does not exist and that priority will be given to resolving that and to arriving at an answer which declares the status of the coupes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill proposes the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of proposed replacement legislation, namely, the Auditor-General Act 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Audit Act 1901 is a pervading, operational act that gives flesh to certain basic Constitutional requirements for the raising and spending of money by the Commonwealth; and, to that end, provides a procedural framework for day-to-day financial administration and audit across the whole spectrum of Commonwealth activities. Its repeal and replacement, therefore, has an extensive impact. This bill is intended to permit an orderly transition to the new framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, this bill provides for the formal transfer, as appropriations, of balances from the Audit Act's existing Fund accounting structure to the new structure established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act; the continuation in office of the person who may be the Auditor-General as at 1 July 1995; the continuation of the existing arrangements for the position of Independent Auditor as auditor of the Australian National Audit Office; the continuation for the time</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">being (until regulations under the replacement legislation come into operation) of the current safeguards, as agreed by Parliament, under section 70D of the Audit Act 1901, in relation to the nature of audit and financial reporting disclosures for the security and intelligence agencies; and the making of regulations to cover a range of situations, at a procedural level, should it be needed, to demonstrate legal certainty to other parties so as to support a smooth transition to the new legislative framework&mdash;eg, for the continuation of the myriad contractual and other arrangements entered into under the authority of the repealed act, such as operating bank accounts, contract audits in progress, debtors' repayments by instalments etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill's extensive impact, however, can be seen in the Schedule to the bill&mdash;in the proposed consequential amendments to the relevant provisions of the more than one hundred other acts which refer in specific ways to the current Audit Act 1901. The proposed amendments will replace those acts' "Audit Act" references with provisions that appropriately link them to the framework of the new financial legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to those Commonwealth Authorities for which the Schedule specifies consequential amendments to their enabling legislation so as to link those authorities to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies act, it should be noted that the list is not exhaustive. The authorities are only those whose enabling legislation reflects Part XI of the Audit Act 1901. A further transitional bill will be necessary to create the necessary linkages to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act for the forty or so bodies whose enabling legislation does not reflect Part XI.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the introduction of a bill to replace the Audit Act 1901 should be marked as an event of particular significance in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. Apart from the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Audit Act is the oldest law passed by Parliament that is still in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The long title of the Audit Act 1901 describes its purpose to be "An act to make provision for the Collection and Payment of the Public Moneys and the Audit of the Public Accounts and the Protection and Recovery of Public Property. . . ". It has, for 93 years, done the job. This country has been well served by the financial principles established through its provisions, because it has, indeed, kept every Commonwealth Government since Federation financially honest in more than just a rhetorical sense. Over nine decades, there have been countless departmental officials and Auditors, and not a few Parliamentarians, who have confidently looked to the Audit Act 1901 as both the shield and the sword of Commonwealth financial integrity. Mr President, I am sure that none of them, were they here today, could have any doubt that the framework to be created by the legislation that is replacing the Audit Act 1901 will not only preserve that financial integrity, but strengthen it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that spirit, Mr President, I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting of the winter sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994. </PARA>

<PARA>The government does have reasons for the urgent passage of this legislation. As the Senate is aware, in the immediate period leading up to Christmas, some eight boats containing almost 700 unauthorised arrivals from the People's Republic of China arrived in northern Australia. On 30 December I announced that the government would move forthwith to introduce measures which would prevent any people without claims on Australia from abusing our refugee processes and tying up considerable public resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An overwhelming number of the recent arrivals from the PRC are refugees from Vietnam who were granted protection in the People's Republic of China. I announced that I would be initiating steps to ensure that the safe third country legislation, which was passed by the parliament last year, could be applied to these people. Since 30 December and, in fact, before that date, we have had extensive bilateral negotiations with the PRC, together with the cooperation of the UNHCR. Those negotiations have resulted in the conclusion of a safe third country agreement covering the refugees from Vietnam who have been given protection by the PRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I must put on the record my appreciation of the good work that has been done by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs&mdash;by Dennis Richardson and others both here and in China&mdash;and also the Department of Foreign Affairs in working on this agreement and achieving agreement after negotiation with the People's Republic of China, with the cooperation of the UNHCR. That agreement has now been given effect under the safe third country legislation by way of the regulations that were tabled last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), however, will be to give the agreement and its operation under the safe third country provisions effect from the date of my announcement, being 30 December 1994. This of course was foreshadowed in my statement at the time. It is essential to the government's stated intention that we do this&mdash;that is, apply the safe third country provisions to all of the recent arrivals falling within the terms of the agreement. To do so, we have to pass this bill as soon as possible. Were the Senate not to deal with this bill until the next session, a number of the recent arrivals who have lodged refugee claims since my announcement of 30 December would be able to pursue those claims, notwithstanding the fact that they had already been granted protection by the People's Republic of China and had already been put on notice of the government's intention that the safe third country provisions should apply to them. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to very briefly canvass some matters which are of great concern to me in relation to Aerospace Technologies of Australia Ltd. Of recent days, we have learnt of the failure of the Blackhawk helicopters, which are produced by Sikorsky, owned and run by the Australian Army but maintained by ASTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put some questions on notice about the Blackhawks. I expect and hope that I will get answers from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) very quickly. It is a serious matter when 23 out of 27 of the Blackhawks at Townsville are not operational and, apparently, a number of them have been in that state since about September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is focused on a number of matters, but particularly on the question of maintenance by ASTA. In 1992, my colleague Senator Baden Teague asked a question in estimates about the progress being made in the commercialisation of the maintenance of Blackhawk helicopters. He was told that the army had negotiated a maintenance standing offer with ASTA Defence for the highest level of Blackhawk maintenance. That agreement allowed for an estimated 15 R3 services&mdash;that is, periodic services&mdash;every 500 flying hours to check all major items for airworthiness and associated repairs every year. The standing offer was a firm priced agreement for a period of three years with a two-year extendable option. The estimated total cost per annum was $1.05 million. As I understand it, ASTA maintained five aircraft in the first year, and it was anticipated that it would reach optimum capacity of 15 aircraft a year in early 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems being found with the Blackhawks are corrosion and cracking. We have been given various reasons for why these might have occurred. I am concerned as to why it has taken this long for us to be told about this matter and what ASTA's role was in the checking and maintenance. It was up to ASTA to look at the cracking; it was up to ASTA to advise that it was going through spares at an unacceptable rate. It is surely the responsibility of the contractor&mdash;as ASTA was&mdash;to keep these aircraft in the air. Although I recognise that the army may well have been responsible for field maintenance, these aircraft were to be kept in the air by ASTA Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My special concerns are that only recently I tabled an ombudsman's report in the Senate into the death of an RAAF pilot flying a Nomad. You may well recall that the ombudsman focused very harshly on ASTA's failure to maintain the aircraft which that young pilot was flying. Once again, we found that the board of inquiry had reported on the failure of ASTA to detect cracking by visual inspection, compared to the use of current techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have ASTA failing to do its duty by the air force in relation to the Nomads that were on loan to it and that went back to the air force. We now have problems apparently with ASTA not doing its job. Certainly, there are big question marks over the job ASTA is doing under contract for the Department of Defence on the Blackhawks. These are questions which must be answered urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in relation to the Nomad pilot, ASTA has chosen, despite damning evidence at the board of inquiry which was repeated by the ombudsman, to contest the dead pilot's family in the courts as to its responsibility. We are lucky that we have not had any cases at this stage of army pilots going to their death as a result of failure of checking and maintenance. It is no good for Australia's defence capability to have these expensive aircraft sitting on the ground, although I would prefer them to be on the ground if the lives of our airmen are at stake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate must be concerned at the role of ASTA. If it is to be privatised, who is going to queue up to buy an organisation which appears to have let the defence forces of this country down in the maintenance role which it contracts for?</PARA>

<PARA>This report is to do with the National Road Transport Commission. A bill that went through this parliament four or five years ago was charged to create uniform traffic laws, uniform mass laws and uniform licensing laws for heavy vehicles right around Australia, and this document is virtually a progress report on what has been happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Quite a bit has happened since that time, mainly to do with getting uniform licensing of vehicles for the different sort of work they do. The Road Transport Reform (Vehicle and Traffic) Act 1993 that went through this parliament addressed vehicle standards, driving hours, road rules, mass loadings, and oversized and over-mass vehicles and combinations. There has been progress in lots of other ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later this week, we will be debating the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill in this parliament. I think it is a very sensible move down the line. I read only today about the ridiculous situation where a Western Australian bulk goods carrier of dangerous goods had a double-B with a triple 25-metre bulk carrier built in Queensland. It was built up there because it was probably the best tender available at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was not known at the time was that they had to get clearance from Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and, finally, Western Australia to have it examined for its dangerous goods carrying capacity, yet it had never had any dangerous goods put in it. It was simply an empty set of new containers, but it cost $10,000 in Queensland, $10,000 in New South Wales and $10,000 in South Australia just to get it home empty. The result was that they were able to avoid at least two of those inspections, in New South Wales and South Australia, by taking it on a back track&mdash;the Innaminka track&mdash;to get it back to Western Australia. This was a very ridiculous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it had a load of dangerous goods, then I believe it would have been reasonable to have it examined. But it was completely empty. It did not have anything in it, so I thought it was a stupid situation. This is something which the dangerous goods bill and the other uniform regulations for heavy transport, contained in the NRTC bill of some years ago brought about. I presume that if the dangerous goods legislation were in place, we would not have had that silly situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the NRTC has a lot more work to do. The Western Australian representative on the ministerial council for transport, which has representatives from around Australia, is the state Minister for Transport, the Hon. Eric Charlton. Even though Western Australia has a rather different agenda for the NRTC and uniform regulations for heavy transport, it mirrors the Commonwealth legislation in its own legislation without handing everything over to the Commonwealth. Western Australia wishes to have a degree of independence because a lot of things are unique to Western Australia. Senator Ellison and other Western Australian senators tell us this all the time. I believe the NRTC is progressing as it recognises Western Australia's unique situation, when necessary. I look forward to the completion of its task in years to come. The heavy transport industry will be far better for it in the final analysis. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I have been asked to present information which is important for this nation to hear and which is important to be tabled at this time. While neither endorsing nor condemning the information that I bring to the Senate, I think it is important that it be given the opportunity to be presented in this place. Therefore, I have agreed to present it on behalf of a group of people who approached me in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asked to imagine an Australia where all Australians enjoy perfect health, a long and happy life free from disease and the satisfaction of seeing their highest potential fully expressed in their lives. Imagine an Australia where education is enjoyable for teachers and students alike and where every student and citizen is trained to enjoy a mistake free life. Imagine an Australia free from crime and violence, where every Australian can feel safe and at home wherever they are and whatever they are doing; an Australia in which growth and progress are dynamic, balanced and sustained steadily decade after decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the components of an invincible Australia. These should perhaps be the ideal goals of this parliament and certainly this chamber. I present to the chamber the discovery of a body of science and technology that is unprecedented in the history of this country and which can achieve these goals to change life in Australia and, in fact, the planet. This science is Maharishi's Vedic science of consciousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would rightly ask: where does this science come from? Vedic science has been developed in its modern form by the enlightened Indian scholar Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Maharishi is best known for his development of the technique of transcendental meditation and, more recently, for his reconstruction of the traditional system of Vedic medicine known as Maharishi Ayur-Veda. Its importance can be demonstrated by listing four of its best documented achievements. The methods are not philosophical; they are practical. They are fully documented by many hundreds of scientific research studies. Later I will seek leave to table some of this material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the Senate examples of its results. Firstly, research shows that Vedic health science can almost eliminate the two most devastating diseases of our time&mdash;namely, cancer and heart disease. In 1987, a study was published in the journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Psychosomatic Medicine</EMPHASIS> showing that those engaged in the practice of Vedic health techniques have an 86 per cent decrease in heart disease and a 55 per cent decrease in cancer. The study showed a further 50 to 70 per cent decrease in all other illnesses and in hospital admissions and other medical needs. These findings indicate that, if the Australian population had universal access to these programs, over 1,200 lives would be saved every week. The savings in costs are estimated at 50 per cent of today's health budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Vedic education methods are the only methods that can significantly increase both intelligence and lateral or creative thinking. A large number of studies have demonstrated this in both children and adults. One of the best studies, on high school children, demonstrated not only increases in intelligence and creativity but actually showed that these children rose from average levels of performance to the top five per cent in their state in just a few years. These children are ahead in success, productivity, health, balance and happiness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance to Australia of this systematic development of mental potential, in particular creativity, cannot be overemphasised. Innovation and lateral thinking are the essence of our nation's future. In the past, these high level qualities were thought to be inborn and not capable of cultivation. Today, with Maharishi's Vedic science, it is possible for anyone to enhance creativity. The capacity for brilliant insight can be systematically cultivated to an extraordinary degree. In particular, the Vedic techniques of transcendental meditation, and its more advanced counterpart the TM-Sidhi program, are critical to this achievement. Australia's future depends on the development of creativity and innovation to provide new products and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would dearly love to see this country become the first in the world to achieve a true intelligence development industry&mdash;a true brain development industry. We know our future lies in Asia. What can be our best contribution to our neighbours? Surely it must be knowledge and an education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One country, Cambodia, has already used Australian expertise and finance to create a Vedic university. Cambodia's Maharishi Vedic University specialises in management, medicine, agriculture and architecture. The foreign minister of that country, His Excellency Ung Huot&mdash;and I must say that Mr Ung Huot has himself been an Australian citizen and communications technologist for 20 years&mdash;has declared Cambodia's Maharishi Vedic University as one of the greatest gifts Australia has given to his country and that this Vedic university has become a shining light of peace and harmony in the Cambodian nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third set of evidence is that scientific research in prisons shows that Vedic methods of rehabilitation can successfully reverse criminal behaviour. The studies show that recidivism rates reduced from as high as 80 per cent to as little as 10 per cent. This means a reduction of at least 80 per cent in the number of repeat offenders in our society. As we know, the cost is at least $40,000 per prisoner per year to maintain them in confinement, let alone the immense cost of damage, injury, detection and apprehension. This means a saving of untold millions of dollars per year in addition to the human cost to criminals, victims and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth set of evidence, and perhaps the most profound, is the scientific research which shows that Maharishi Vedic technologies for government administration can improve the quality of life in society as a whole within a few months. Research findings in that area include: firstly, reduced crime rates; secondly, reduced accidents; thirdly, reduced sickness and hospital admissions; and, fourthly, improved economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 40 studies in the past 20 years indicate that a very small number of people&mdash;even a few hundred or a few thousand individuals&mdash;in a group using the most advanced Vedic techniques of consciousness, in particular yogic flying, can achieve all of these results within months. Such a group is called a group for a government because it enhances government achievements in these ways. By creating coherence in collective consciousness, the group for a government program enlivens the very basis of governmental success; namely, the collective intelligence of the whole population. It is therefore a true and legitimate administrative strategy. It is one that operates on a level never before adequately addressed by any government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the area of crime reduction. The most dramatic demonstration of this technology took place recently in a large, formal and high quality research project conducted in Washington DC in July 1993, some 18 months ago. The Washington study was extremely rigorous. It was supervised by the District of Columbia Council, the District of Columbia Police and an independent board of scholars from local universities. The research team predicted that, with the introduction of the group practice of yogic flying by about 4,000 people, crime would be reduced by 20 per cent. In fact, crime was reduced by 18 per cent within a month. Furthermore, the research showed that, if the project had been continued for 100 days, the reduction in crime would have been at 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be seeking leave to table the study which demonstrates this information. I remind the chamber that Washington DC has the highest crime rate in the world, with losses of over $1 billion a year due to crime. A 20 per cent to 40 per cent reduction would be an enormous saving of human life, health and costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Washington is not alone. Liverpool in England has achieved similar results on a sustained basis by the same methods. It is estimated that over 130,000 crimes have been prevented in the Merseyside area over three years, resulting in cost savings of #650 million in that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that I am presenting here, which has been passed to me by the group interested in seeing this information being presented to Australia, is contained in some of the documents that I have. They also contain a summary of the ideas of Vedic science. I seek leave to table the documents which demonstrate that information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in the Federal Court at Perth a most important decision was handed down. It involved a case whereby the state of Western Australia and Malcolm Douglas, the proprietor of the Broome Crocodile Farm, took action against the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner. Early last year, the minister had issued a declaration which stopped any further development of the Broome Crocodile Farm due to the development allegedly occurring in an area which was sensitive to local Aboriginal cultural and spiritual interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister did not stop there. He issued a temporary declaration for 30 days. He then extended that for a further 30 days and then imposed a five-year ban on development. During that case, Mr Chaney, a former senator, was appointed as mediator for the parties. During the interim injunctions, mediation and consultation were carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early last year, I raised many questions with the minister and spoke on this matter many times in this chamber. One of the matters that I raised frequently was the question of natural justice and political accountability. It seems that the Federal Court agrees with me, because today all three declarations were declared invalid. They were declared invalid because of a breach of natural justice and improper process. The court found that the minister has breached his duty under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, in that he had not pursued proper process in consultation with the state minister in Western Australia. Furthermore, during the proceedings of mediation and consultation, various submissions were made to Mr Chaney without them being revealed to Mr Douglas or the state government. When Mr Chaney's report was forwarded to the minister, there was some suggestion that he did not read all the submissions that had been made to Mr Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you had was a minister exercising in the most powerful form an act which stopped the development of a private citizen's business. What is more, that was done without that private citizen having any knowledge of or input into adverse allegations which were being made about him. That is an affront to justice in this country; it is an affront to the rules of natural justice. The court found squarely against the minister in relation to all three declarations. That decision was handed down today by His Honour Justice Carr. I understand that the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Richard Court, has made appropriate comments about the Commonwealth riding roughshod over the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, it is a question of illegal use of power. It is an absolute abuse of power and one which is to be despised. I say to the minister: if you care one jot about conciliation in this country and if you care one jot about working towards the solution of Aboriginal problems in this country, particularly the question of the problem of land ownership, you will not go about it by abusing your powers; you will not go about it by denying private citizens the rules of natural justice; and you will not achieve your ends by improper process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the decision by the Federal Court. It vindicates what I have said in this chamber on many occasions. It vindicates the coalition's pursuit of this matter. Senator Campbell and I pursued this with the minister by way of question and comment. One can only question whether Mr Tickner adopted the same bullyboy tactics when he stopped the development of the bridge from Goolwa to Hindmarsh Island in South Australia which sent a private developer bankrupt. In that case, a declaration was made on an ad hoc basis which stopped the building of a bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the situation that I am referring to, the court has already decided squarely against the minister with some scathing comments as to the process that was adopted. I say to this government: if you are going to exercise your power in this arrogant fashion, then citizens will take you to court and you will be found accountable by the courts of this land. What is more, you will be found even more accountable when it comes to the ballot box. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to take note of some matters that have been receiving a lot of attention in the chamber and also in the media. The first of these is the criticisms of the high conservation value forest identification exercise that was conducted by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. The criticisms that have been made do not hold water and are largely a political exercise designed to remove what little protection the process had given to some areas of high conservation value forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my belief, the criticisms were designed, and are designed, to discredit the conservation movement, but they will fail. The reports that were put together by these conservation councils and bodies around the country were based on the work of eminent scientists and were sent to a range of federal and state departments for comment. In many instances, information on the value of areas was drawn from government agencies and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a major point which was already made by Senator Faulkner in question time, and I am very glad of that. It seems to have been overlooked in the public debate. When there have been attempts to discredit the coupes that have been set aside for protection by making statements such as that they contain airstrips and areas that have already been logged, there is a failure to understand that the boundaries of coupes and forests blocks are set by state agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservationists were not able to draw boundaries around areas of high conservation value. Consequently, coupes, compartments or blocks can obviously contain some form of disturbance. But this does not mean that other parts of the defined area do not have high conservation value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to these criticisms has been very ably expressed by the National Forest Summit, which met on 4 February 1995. For the convenience of the Senate, I seek leave to incorporate the two-page response to those criticisms, which is a very enlightening document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOW ACCURATE ARE INDUSTRY CRITICISMS OF THE HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE FOREST IDENTIFICATION EXERCISE CONDUCTED BY FAULKNER?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A position paper by the National Forest Summit&mdash;4 February 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forest industries and some politicians are at present claiming that some areas on the list of high conservation value coupes and compartments presented by the Prime Minister from Mr Faulkner's original list are not of high conservation value. Why is this misleading?</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most claims of this sort rely on the fact that a coupe or compartment contains some form of disturbance, such as an old air strip, quarry or plantation. This ignores the very simple fact that a coupe or compartment can contain a small area of non-high conservation value and still contain large areas of high conservation value forest. In such cases, a small area of low conservation value is being used to claim that a large area of high conservation value is of low conservation value. People making claims of this sort are either simply naive or are not scientifically literate.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry will also assert that many of these areas have been logged before, and ask you to make the assumption that this means these areas should not be on the high conservation list. What has to be realised is that within a set area, such as a coupe or compartment, it is possible to log part of the area, with the remaining forest still untouched. This is in fact common practice. It is a silly leap of logic that dictates this means that the untouched forest is also of low conservation value. The recommendations for protection were based on the value of the unlogged forest within such compartments, not the patches of regrowth. It is also possible that some coupes or compartments have been selectively harvested many decades ago. Those practices involved the removal of low numbers of carefully selected trees, and is very different to the far more destructive logging practices of today. While this past selective logging may have caused some damage to some of the area's conservation values, in many cases they still represent the last examples of those forest communities.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another interesting piece of misdirection is the insinuation that this exercise was meant to be the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories' (DEST) definitive exercise on the identification of areas of high conservation value. This claim is incorrect, but it is used in an attempt to make the exercise appear to be of a low standard by comparing it to other larger projects. In fact this exercise was never meant to be the end of the process, but simply an interim measure to prevent further loss of high conservation value forests until fully adequate surveys of all forest values could be completed.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What critics have further failed to realise is that the exercise surveyed a wide range of conservation values beyond just old growth, including wilderness, World Heritage, endangered species, water catchment values and Aboriginal values. It is essential that when assessing an area all these values are considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such criticisms in no way blemish the credibility of Faulkner's study. They are simply a desperate attempt to hold on to the high conservation value forests for logging and woodchipping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A list is included below of some examples of industry confusion on the issue:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compartment 2331 in Glenbog State Forest in the South East of NSW was reported in "The Australian" (18-19/1/95) as being a compartment that had been logged twice before and contained much regrowth. However, being 200 hectares in size, it also contains a significant area of old growth forest and is an important catchment supplying water to the dairy industry around Bega.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was reported in the Australian today that compartment 32 in Stewarts Brook State Forest in NE NSW is not high conservation value because it includes camping areas and a tip. They have failed to recognise that this compartment contains significant populations of two nationally vulnerable plants, a very significant swamp, and is unlogged. It is important not just for its natural values but also as a significant area for recrea tion.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry maintains that the presence of an airstrip in compartment 191 in MacPherson State Forest in NE NSW means that the surrounding forests have no conservation values. They have failed to recognise that this compartment is in the Warre Warren Aboriginal Place which is listed on the National Estate, and that two nationally vulnerable plants species and one nationally endangered animal species have been recorded in the vicinity.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Victoria, claims of pine plantations and other disturbances have not even been substantiated by industry or Government forestry agencies. As the information used by conservation groups in their original recommendations to Mr Faulkner were sourced from material provided by these very agencies, it would appear that any errors in the identification process were their own fault and so their criticisms are directed at themselves.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. My first point is that the criticism of the boundaries and what is contained within them is not at all valid if it is intended to cast aspersions on the very important process that was undertaken by the conservation movement when it was asked for advice by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I would like to relate the process that went on in Western Australia. In Western Australia, the list was provided by the Conservation Council and was not in any sense an ambit claim. Many areas, including heritage-listed areas, were not incorporated because of the lack of information available. The Conservation Council put forward a compromise list of 29 forest blocks. Senator Faulkner recommended that 21 of them be protected. The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) listed two. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has raised that number to 12. I might add that that fails to protect them, because access to them has not been protected by that response. Roads are being made and disturbance is continuing within those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CALM has scheduled 75 blocks for logging in the central and southern forest regions of Western Australia in 1995. Mr Keating identified only 12 for the temporary protection that may be afforded by his rapid assessment process. So we believe it is very serious that the process fails to protect even those areas that are supposedly being looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern in Western Australia is that the state environment minister, Mr Kevin Minson, has ordered Western Australian loggers to ignore the ban on logging in the Rosa forest block south of Nannup, which was one of the areas identified by Mr Keating. Yesterday CALM informed the conservationists from the local community of Northcliffe that they would stop work on a logging super-highway through Jane Forest near the town. Today CALM contractors were again felling trees to make way for the road with little regard for the protesters who are trying to protect that area of forest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point relates to a passing comment of Senator Abetz earlier today. Senator Abetz dismissed the phrase that forests could be lost forever. He made a joke of it and said that forests could only be lost if the areas were dynamited and destroyed totally so that nothing could grow on them. I must put on the public record and inform Senator Abetz that he is clearly displaying his ignorance as to the difference between forests and trees and the degree to which forests can be affected by logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A forest is much more than an area where trees grow. I particularly want to differentiate it from regrowth, or what grows after clear-felling has taken place. Forests have biodiversity. They have different species of trees and foliage growing in them. They form a complete ecosystem and provide habitat and a range of flora and fauna that makes them irreplaceable once they are logged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very beautiful area known as the 100-year old forest near Boranup in south-west Western Australia. Many people have been there. I have really enjoyed it myself. It took some education for me to realise that it is a karri forest that is the result of intensive logging. Instead of a real old-growth forest with diversity and a complete ecosystem being created, a monoculture has been produced. Because it is 100 years old, it is very beautiful and definitely evidence to support the argument which people often use that `forests or trees grow back'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who wanders through that forest will notice that in some places the very beautiful, tall karri trees are close together. On one walk, I noticed that four trees growing together in a very outstanding way were all growing out of one stump. So, in a sense, that forest is not the forest that was logged. It is a different forest that is 100 years old and which has a value of its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to protect&mdash;this is what the debate is about&mdash;those old-growth areas of forest that still remain. Those high conservation value forests that still remain need to be protected in a way that that area was not. It is not a question of their not growing again. Cleared land, which produces salinity and water catchment problems, will sometimes not grow again. We are not saying that the forest industry will prevent trees growing; we are saying that the forests that we so prize in our community will be lost forever. New  growth will occur, but it will not be the same. It is an irretrievable position. That is why it is very important that the federal and state governments do not lose the political will, which they have not demonstrated so far but which the community is demanding of them, to protect those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the shortage of time, I seek leave to incorporate a two-page statement by seven leading forest ecologists calling for the better protection of native forests and defining the process and their understanding of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAS LEADING FOREST ECOLOGISTS CALL FOR BETTER PROTECTION OF NATIVE FORESTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responding to the continuing debate over the future of the export woodchip industry, some of Australias leading forest ecologists have called upon the Commonwealth and State Governments and all parts of the Australian community to act decisively to protect the nations remaining old growth eucalypt forests and other forests vital for the long term conservation of biological diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiation of an export woodchip industry has led to the increased logging of Australias forests. This increased logging is largely due to clearfelling and is concentrated in forests which are largely undisturbed and contain large mature trees. Many plants and animals depend on large mature trees for essential resources such as food and shelter. Such species are restricted to forests that have had little or not disturbance from unnatural processes such as clearfelling. The impact on plants and animals living on the ground is also of particular concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over half of our native forests have been permanently cleared since European occupation, and the present rate of forest clearance in many Australian regions well exceeds that observed in the Amazon Basin. The current conservation reserve system is inadequate and fails to protect many distinct types of old growth forest and biodiversity. Australian Governments and the community must take action if these unique ecosystems and forest biodiversity are to be conserved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australias forests will never be managed sustainably if Governments continue with the present piecemeal approach of assessing individual compartments and coupes. Proper planning and management requires the comprehensive assessment of forests at a regional level. Australian Governments gave a commitment in the National Forest Policy Statement to undertake regional assessments so as to ensure the adequate protection of wilderness and old growth forests. This commitment must be followed through.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of comprehensive regional assessments, the most prudent course of action for the Commonwealth and State Governments to take is to immediately suspend logging in the 1300 compartments nominated by the Federal Environment Minister, Senator John Faulkner. The process by which Senator Faulkners department determined the 1300 areas <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">likely</EMPHASIS> to have high conservation values was a reasonable and valid process. These 1300 areas represent only a proportion of the native forest scheduled for logging in 1995. The conservation values of these areas, and particularly the 509 compartments to be fast-tracked, must now be determined by a thorough and independent scientific review involving institutions such as CSIRO and universities. Because of the known and potential ecological significance of these forest areas, this review must draw upon the best available information and will require collaboration between governments, scientists and the community.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Is the Minister aware that, only as recently as the week beginning 27 November 1994, members of the Forest Information Network documented no less than five breaches of prescription in compartment 13 of Croobyar State Forest with a district forester.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Is the Minister aware that these breaches included the logging of three habitat trees with obvious hollows and two examples of logging within a prescribed filter strip.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) State Forests of New South Wales has advised that the 5 alleged breaches related to the felling of two trees in an owl prescription zone and the felling of three trees into a prescribed filter strip. I understand that the trees felled into the filter strip were accidentally hit by other trees which were being harvested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Where export licence conditions have been breached a licence can be revoked or financial penalties applied. Specifically in the case raised by the honourable senator, State Forests of New South Wales have investigated the alleged breaches and have concluded that there were three breaches of logging prescriptions. I understand that State Forests of New South Wales is taking disciplinary action in relation to these breaches. I understand that the State's Environment Protection Agency is also investigating whether the breaches contravene the pollution licence issued to State Forests of New South Wales. Appropriate follow up action consistent with the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations under the Export Control Act 1982 will be taken in all cases where breaches have been demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The matters raised by the honourable senator in questions 1 and 2 relate primarily to sawlog operations in 1994 and given the action described above I do not believe action is required in relation Harris Daishowa's 1995 licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I announced in December that the 1995 export licences contained tough new conditions to protect the environment. I also announced that measures are being developed to improve monitoring of environmental conditions in woodchip export licences. I will be increasing the intensity of the Commonwealth's monitoring of compliance with licence conditions. I will require the Chief Executive Officer of each company holding a licence to provide a report to me at the end of the year of the company's compliance with the conditions of the licence.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Commonwealth has not issued a licence for the export of minor species sawlogs from Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that all sawlogs of the minor species are sold to sawmills. State approved timber classification officers inspect logs prior to chipping to ensure sawlogs have not been incorrectly classified. Forestry Tasmania also has a system of random checks to ensure a high standard of log classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The volume of minor species pulpwood exported from Tasmania in the last half of 1994 is not recorded separately by the Commonwealth from other pulpwood exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the value of sawlogs is higher than that of pulplogs there is an economic incentive for managers of wood production forests to maximise sawlog recovery rather than convert sawlogs to woodchips.</PARA>
