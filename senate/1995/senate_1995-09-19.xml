<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. The minister will recall that when the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, brought down his One Nation package, he promised to relieve the tax burden on middle income earners&mdash;particularly those on incomes between $20,000 and $40,000&mdash;by bringing in the infamous l-a-w tax cuts. Minister, I remind you also that today we learned that only Australians earning more than $70,000 a year enjoy a lower tax burden than they did in 1983 and that in fact low and middle income families are now paying more tax. Is this what Mr Keating meant when he said, `This is as good as it gets'? Or is this yet another broken promise and a further demonstration of why this government deserves a spell on the bench?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that Senator Hill, coming from the opposition, should raise the question of taxation, because when John Howard was Treasurer of this country, the tax system of Australia was a national disgrace. Wealthy people in this country paid tax if they chose to. The burden of taxation fell on middle and low income earners in this country. Sir Garfield Barwick in the High Court smiled on this system. It was a massive rort, and we remember the bottom-of-the-harbour as a national disgrace. That is your legacy; that is what you delivered. The report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is a report on our reforms and achievements held not against your model of disgrace but against an ideal model&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order on relevance. Consistent with what you have said to us in the past, we have given the minister time to introduce his answer. But now I remind him that the question is about his government's record and its broken promises on taxation. I invite him to answer that question for the benefit of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the other mistruth in this question is about l-a-w, law. We delivered the first tranche of those tax cuts six months ahead of time, and we delivered the second tranche of those tax cuts in the form of payment for superannuation in the last budget, and that is the most responsible way in which it can be done. So let us not have this cant and hypocrisy from the opposition about l-a-w, law. Our promises have been delivered, unlike your `fistful of dollars' promise in the 1977 election when you tried to bribe the Australian people by offering tax cuts which you did not deliver. We have provided seven rounds of tax cuts during the period of our government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn now to the subject under discussion, the report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Might I say that Treasury cannot confirm any of the calculations in the model. Treasury regards that as a flawed model, as misrepresenting and selective and not able to stand up to rigorous analysis in Australia. I remind senators that, under us, Australia has become the second lowest taxed country of the 24 OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, if we go to the report in today's paper, the biggest flaw in it is to include the superannuation guarantee levy as if that were a tax. If that were excluded, middle income earners would be much better off. Indeed, George Megalogenis, the correspondent for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, says in his own analysis:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those on average earnings of $28,348 a year are paying just $4 a week less in income tax now than they did in 1985 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are the remarks of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian's</EMPHASIS> own analysis, which do not support the premise of your question, Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But why should the superannuation guarantee levy be included? It is not a tax. It is certainly not a tax; superannuation is, of course, deferred income for ordinary Australians. It is money not provided to the government, like it may be in other countries. It is money not held by the government, like it might be in other countries. It is money that belongs to the individual and to the worker, not like in other countries. It is their money; not the government's. That is why the OECD regard the superannuation guarantee levy as not a tax. The opposition, who obviously want to use the argument presented in today's paper to suit their own conniving political ends, do not respect the OECD or, indeed, the true character of the superannuation guarantee levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 10 years since we introduced tax reform in this country, the overall revenue for individuals has fallen from 13.5 per cent of GDP to 12 per cent of GDP. That is the record: under you, 13.5 per cent; under us, a fall to 12 per cent. When the coalition was in government, as I said, the tax system in this country was a national joke and a disgrace. The wealthy paid tax if they chose. The burden was on the middle income earners and the low income earners of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Has the minister's attention been drawn to media reports claiming that the rural sector is not capable of sustaining high rates of growth? Can the minister inform the Senate about the state of the rural economy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="950" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen those statements claiming that the rural sector was not capable of contributing to Australia's growth. The statements were made by Senator Ian Macdonald and, of course, therefore, are flatly wrong. Senator Ian Macdonald does not know what he was talking about. As I pointed out to the Senate in some documents I tabled recently, even the State Director of the Queensland Liberal Party was constrained to write a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> saying that Senator Macdonald did not know what he was talking about when he was discussing the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald is equally ignorant about Australia's rural sector. The rural sector in many areas of Australia has been suffering from prolonged and crippling drought which has, understandably, undermined growth rates in that sector. But that is a very different matter to claiming that the sector is fundamentally unable to respond when external factors, such as seasonal conditions and prices, recover&mdash;that was the point Senator Macdonald was trying to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE today issued its latest quarterly outlook for the rural and resources sector. ABARE's main finding is that the rural sector will experience both rising prices and output levels in 1995-96 leading to a very welcome increase in export values for the rural sector. As a result of rising international commodity prices on the back of continuing world growth and a return to more average production levels locally after the drought affected outcomes of the past years&mdash;as a result of all of that&mdash;there will be a very positive outlook for the contribution the rural sector will make to Australia's growth in terms of both rising exports and prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, ABARE forecasts a rise of around two per cent, production up a healthy 13.9 per cent, and rural exports up 5.5 per cent. The minerals resource sector is forecast to put in a strong performance, with export values set to rise by almost 20 per cent, Senator Macdonald.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total value of commodity exports is forecast to rise by 14.1 per cent to $56.9 billion in 1995-96. Mineral resources are forecast to contribute $6 billion in increased value of these exports and rural commodities $1 billion. As I have just said, these ABARE forecasts published today do not reflect a sector with `little chance of contributing to national growth', as claimed by Senator Ian Macdonald. They make a mockery of his claims, although, in here, of course, we are getting very used to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABARE figures are underpinned by effective and clearly articulated government policies&mdash;something that the rural sector is still not getting from the opposition. Even in respect of such serious problems as drought, they are asking the questions and still getting no answers. Rural Australia is still waiting to hear any policy detail at all from this opposition, despite Senator Hill's boast, publicly made, that there are three folders stuffed full of opposition policies. Senator Hill, you have said publicly that you have got three folders stuffed full of opposition policies. It is about time you tabled them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can. A big improvement in grain production is expected in 1995-96, with total winter grain production forecast to be 26.4 million tonnes, some 84 per cent up on 1994-95. This follows a large increase in winter  plantings in Western Australia and southern grain growing areas. Dry warm weather with only patchy rainfall since sowing has unfortunately reduced your prospects for winter crops in Queensland and, as we know, despite recent rain, in northern New South Wales. These figures demonstrate that rural Australia is doing more than its fair share to contribute to national economy growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley. Minister, in 1985 when Mr Keating was a leading advocate of reform of Australia's tax system, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ordinary working people in Australia have . . . not only shouldered the entire burden of the increase in government spending, but they have also taken on board some of the burden previously paid by the upper income groups.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, isn't it a fact that, 10 years later, Australian families continue to carry the burden of higher indirect taxes, that families continue to pay higher personal tax because Mr Keating broke his promise on the l-a-w tax cuts, and that families continue to pay higher home mortgages because we have the highest real interest rates in the world&mdash;all as a result of your government's inability to manage your debt and spending? Minister, will you tell Australian families what has changed since Mr Keating made his statement in 1985?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="951" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, if this question is largely about tax, and it certainly seemed to be, it is wrongly directed to me and it probably should go to Senator Cook. Secondly, what does Senator Minchin mean by `Australian families'&mdash;Australian families this, Australian families that, with no distinguishing features about them at all?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are you trying to make distinctions, Senator, between families where two parents work and families where one parent is at home, or are you talking about different incomes? We have already heard Senator Cook refer to the complete errors in the claim in an article published today about Australians paying more tax. On that evidence already, you would know that Australian families are much better off under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But you ask what has changed since 1985 for families. Senator, let me start telling you a few of the things. We have thousands more child-care places that families with two parents working and families with one parent at home are now enjoying. That is one major change and benefit to Australian families. Secondly, as was the case in 1984 and certainly in 1985, none of the low income families in this country pay their Medicare levy. They are exempt from paying that, Senator, to assist them with the cost of health. Do you remember how those families could not go near the doctor before 1983 because two million of them were not insured? That is one of the other things that we have changed for Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you remember the changes in social security, Senator, with targeted payments for families, benchmark payments for children below 13 and above 13&mdash;benchmarked for the first time ever and indexed to change with inflation? These were enormous benefits for families. The introduction of the parenting allowance was a huge benefit to Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to talk about what is of benefit to families, just remember, since you asked me, that these are just a few of the items. Consider what has happened to Australian families since we came into office. When we came to office, about 36 per cent&mdash;in the thirties&mdash;of children finished year 12. Now, around 80 per cent of children finish year 12. That is another thing Australian families really want for their children. Also, as of about next February families will be eligible for a maternity allowance on the occasion of the birth of a child, which is in recognition of the costs at that time in a family's life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked: what has this government done for families? That is an excellent question. I have barely skimmed the surface. There are many things this government has done for families. If you pick out some of those items without looking at the whole comprehensive picture, you will get it wrong. You cannot look at tax without looking at payments. You cannot look at the benefits to families without looking at the implications of the Accord and the social wage, the benefits of Medicare and the benefits of education, as well as those targeted payments. This government now pays to Australian families over $12 billion in payments. That goes to those very Australian families you were citing a minute ago as being in big trouble. The record stands for itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian High Commission in Nairobi has reported that three Australians are among 20 foreigners being held in Baidoa in Somalia and unable to leave. They are being held by, as has been reported, the local faction leader, General Farah Aideed, who occupied the town of Baidoa on Sunday. The three Australians are an ABC journalist and two women NGO aid workers. Our reports are that the three Australians are presently safe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been exploring this morning avenues to secure the early release of the hostages, including the possibility of getting a personal appeal from me to General Aideed, whom I met in Nairobi last year, and also to Mr Ali Mahdi, whom I met in Mogadishu. Mr Ali Mahdi becomes relevant because, of course, it has been the subject of speculation that he may himself be imminently about to mount a military attack on Baidoa in order to recover the territory just lost to General Aideed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have settled the terms of messages which are now, I think at this moment, being sent through some quite complicated communications channels. The basic message is to urge the relevant factions to ensure the safe release of the hostages as soon as humanly possible and to refrain from any further action which may compromise their safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other contingency planning arrangements which are being made to keep lines of communication open and to assist in any way we can to ensure the safe release of the hostages. We will continue to work with the UN and other countries involved to try and get a peaceful solution of the immediate situation but the larger one as well. I should also add, finally, that the Somali aid coordination body has written to General Aideed seeking a guarantee for the safety of the foreigners and permission for them to be relocated from Baidoa by aircraft, which aircraft remains on stand-by in Nairobi for this purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some advance encouragement to give her a substantive answer is the way in which I would describe it. I can only partially meet that obligation. In relation to measuring unpaid work, however, I can say that Australia is very well advanced as compared with most other countries. The ABS conducts a five-yearly survey of unpaid work&mdash;the time use survey. The 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">System of National Accounts</EMPHASIS> recommends that the boundary of production could be extended by incorporating unpaid household work and voluntary and community work in so-called satellite accounts. The ABS supports this approach and is presently working towards its development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the kinds of estimates that have been made as to the value of that work, in 1992 the estimated total value of unpaid work was $227.8 billion&mdash;that is to say, nearly 60 per cent of GDP; 58 per cent in fact. Unpaid household work contributed $209.7 billion of that. The remaining $18.1 billion was comprised of volunteer and community work.

Equally, there is no doubt that conferences of this kind are extremely useful in getting a better appreciation of what is already going on by way of policy addressing these issues and also in opening up new items on the international agenda for us to pursue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Microsoft is going all right, thank you, Senator. The partnerships for development program was inaugurated by this government. It enables major international companies to have access to government contracts. It encourages them to form a partnership with the government in order to do research and development here, to locate manufacturing or other operations here, and to export from Australia and thus address some or our current account issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today IBM graduated with distinction from the partnerships for development program. It has been in the program since 1988. As a consequence of that program and the partnership during that period, IBM exported $3 billion worth of equipment and product from Australia. In last year alone, it managed to export $550 million worth of information technology from Australia. This is an excellent example of how the government, working with major private sector companies, can target and influence the shape and size of an Australian industry and how the industry, basing itself in Australia on a competitive basis, can achieve major exports in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, since the government launched its regional headquarters program just two years ago, 63 companies have now located their regional headquarters in Australia, with a total investment brought by them of $1.7 billion and the creation of just over 5,500 jobs for Australians. If we look at what has happened in the last three months, 21 information technology companies have committed $1.6 billion in manufacture and strategic investment to Australia.

Since then, to the year 1994, we have exported $2.4 billion in information technology products and services&mdash;a 2,400 per cent increase on what the coalition was able to deliver for this country  and, as a consequence, a quite dramatic increase for the industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

This represents a boost in exports and R&amp;D of around $8 billion since the program commenced.

Isn't that because the government fraudulently uses figures that include compulsory social security contributions in other OECD countries but do not include our compulsory superannuation charges? Isn't the OECD definition, which is not based on salaries confiscated by law, absurd in Australia's case? Isn't it really the case that we rank in the middle of the OECD in terms of our overall tax burden and that our position relative to other OECD countries has actually deteriorated since Labor's election in 1983?</PARA></TALK.START>

By way of an example is my own state of South Australia. Some of the areas with higher unemployment than the average, of course, are the northern suburbs of Salisbury and Elizabeth. I was delighted to see that Minister Crean visited that area and was able to detail a series of initiatives that will lead to over 1,500 job opportunities in South Australia with many employers in the northern region&mdash;work which is an excellent outcome for that area.</PARA>

In addition, he was able to announce the government's commitment of $11.5 million to new work opportunities programs, which will see up to 1,000 long-term unemployed people engaged in revegetation and other related activities developing the state's national parks and reserves.</PARA>

In view of strong criticisms by friends of Dr Flynn of what they say is the inadequate response of the Australian consular service to his plight, what action has the minister taken to ensure that the human rights of this Australian citizen, which are claimed to have been disregarded by Australian authorities, are given the full protection that strong diplomatic representations could provide?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not at all sure that the current very high profile media campaign being directed on this issue is really serving Dr Flynn's interests very well. I certainly have concerns&mdash;and I have had them for many months now&mdash;about his continued detention without trial under the relevant Indian legislation, particularly given his ongoing health problems. We share the concerns which have been articulated about many aspects of the handling of the case within the Indian system, particularly with regard to the delays in the High Court hearing of the case against his detention and some of the uncertainties and vagaries that have been involved on the criminal side of the equation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is simply utterly untrue to say that I, or my department, or the Australian High Commission in New Delhi, have been sitting on our hands, somehow lacking interest in this matter. I, for a start, raised the issue with one of my Indian counterparts when I was there in May. Senator McMullan did so as well earlier this year. High Commission officers have met with Dr Flynn on more than two dozen occasions, on top of numerous and often very long telephone conversations with him and his legal representatives concerning his detention, as you would expect in a matter of this complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian High Commission has itself made over 10 representations&mdash;a number of them at very high level&mdash;to the Indian authorities concerning his medical condition and the conditions of his detention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are extraordinarily complex legal issues involved here. For a start, there is the question associated with criminal proceedings under the Customs Act which were initiated only after a long delay, are very slow and which have not yet got to the stage of even committal for trial. But, at Dr Flynn's request&mdash;and this has not featured very largely in the media campaign or the public relations firm's accounts of what is going on&mdash;the High Commission has been asked directly not to intervene in any of the judicial proceedings under the Customs Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the other proceeding, which is the present authority for his detention, that is under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, which is a form of administrative detention and, as such, highly colourable in principle, one would have thought; although it is subject to procedures for judicial review applications and a number of things of that kind: we have supported his legal case under that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were in fact on the verge of initiating a further legal action, just prior to the media campaign which started last week, which did involve an application for parole and which would have been followed by further application under section 11 of the relevant act for the revocation of the detention order. We have been asked now by Dr Flynn and his lawyers not to pursue that particular action. I am not quite sure why that is the case. One reason for not pursuing the parole action that has been bruited about in public statements recently is the suggestion that to proceed with the parole application would somehow jeopardise his situation because it would represent a kind of concession to the validity of the detention order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all very well; except that Flynn's own lawyers made just such an application themselves under section 12 for temporary release or parole, which bid failed on 5 July. We were seeking ways, by taking our own legal advice to do so, in order to have another go at just that action which they themselves had taken and had failed. If they thought that was conceding the validity of the detention order then, why they have changed their minds now I am not quite sure.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not fuelling the French nuclear tests with our uranium. There is a small quantity of Australian uranium, representing about three per cent of the commercial power energy sources that are required, which goes into the civil side of the French system. That is subject to a bilateral safeguards arrangement. It is also subject, like similar arrangements of other nuclear weapon states, to a voluntary offer agreement which France has entered into and which enables the IAEA to verify that the designated nuclear material in France remains in civil use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole safeguard system, which as I said yesterday has been absolutely crucial to the maintenance of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty regime since the 1960s, depends on the operations of those particular safeguards. If some ill-considered and misguided statements by French ministers have called into question the French commitment to those safeguard regimes, then the French have bought for themselves a much more serious problem than the one involving the supply of Australian uranium. What they have done is thrown into doubt the credibility of their commitment to a safeguards system which is applicable world wide and which is of fundamental importance, as I have just said, to the integrity of the nuclear non-proliferation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have absolutely nothing to apologise for so far as the supply of Australian uranium is concerned. It is not just a matter of making a commercial return and not having anything to be concerned about so far as the use of that uranium for military purposes is concerned. It is more than that. As I tried to explain to Senator Margetts, I think it was, the other day, all of those countries around the world that possess either nuclear technology or nuclear raw materials have an obligation under the non-proliferation treaty, because of the balance of obligations that were struck in that treaty, to make available that material or that technology, as the case may be, for peaceful purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the bargain that was struck in the 1960s to ensure that the then non-nuclear weapon states would not acquire nuclear weapons. They said, `We're prepared to go down that track provided we are guaranteed a supply of uranium or a supply of nuclear technology and provided we are not going to be prejudiced, inhibited or disadvantaged in any way.' Those other countries&mdash;the weapon states&mdash;accepted certain obligations to eventually eliminate their weapons and do a number of other things. Countries generally, including those in the position of Australia which possess this resource, were also obligated to follow a certain course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we are sticking to our guns on this. Not only do we think that there is no reason for doubt about where the uranium is actually going because the safeguards system does work, not only because we think the French are being extremely cynical in the way in which they are advancing this particular proposition because they know perfectly well, as I said yesterday, that they stand to benefit commercially if we do go down this track because of the cheaper availability of spot uranium at the moment, but we stand by our position because it is a principled position and because it goes to the heart of the credibility of the nuclear non-proliferation system.</PARA>

But what he said about the direction of our uranium was absolutely false. If he is accurate, what he is doing is saying something much more serious than giving a message to Australia. He is saying that the whole safeguards system which has been entered into is a total fraud and a sham. I do not think he was saying that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that this is the third consecutive year of strong growth being maintained at an average four per cent over the last three financial years. That is what the growth rate has been. It came in at 4.8 per cent in 1994-95. It needed to be slowed down, for a whole variety of reasons which you and others were pressing upon us and which we readily acknowledged.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens thereafter remains to be seen, but we are confident that we can sustain growth at around about the four per cent level right through to the end of this particular decade, producing as a result the five per cent unemployment target which we have put up in neon lights as our objective and as our target and which we are well on the way to achieving, with 675,000 Australians put back to work since the time of the last election.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Minchin this day, relating to families.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the minister really avoided my question, which was about the situation facing Australian families 10 years after Mr Keating's tax summit. All we got from the minister was a little list of expenditure items, which was her basis for asserting that families are better off. What her little list boiled down to was an assertion that there were more child-care places, which is the case, although it is ironic that she should make that claim when this Senate is debating a bill put forward by this government to limit Australians' access to child care and limit it in such a way that it will hurt low income families the most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there are more child-care places really is a response to demand for more child-care places, a demand in part resulting from Australian families now needing two incomes if they are to survive under this government's economic policies. Survey after survey has shown that Australian families are now saying they cannot survive on only one income under this government's policies. That is why there have to be more child-care places and that is why the government has had to meet that demand. This government, through its economic policies, is basically killing off the single income family. We will only be able to see that in museums after 12 1/2 years of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the minister cited was the maternity allowance. Okay, that is coming before this Senate, but that does not come in until 1 February 1996. Australians might well be quite cynical about the timing of that&mdash;very conveniently placed at about the time the next federal election is due. The maternity allowance itself represents a massive broken promise that was made to the trade union movement about the nature of the maternity allowance. It is a very big retreat from what was originally promised to Australians and Australian unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She then also cited the parenting allowance. That was originally the home child-care allowance, which was nothing more than a name change from the dependent spouse rebate for families with children. All they did was a mirrors trick by changing the name and calling it something else. Now they have changed the name again. So it did not really amount to anything substantial in the way of an extra benefit for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is not much of a record. The record of the government is one of incredible adhockery and confusion. Australian families have no idea of what really is on offer from the government, because of the confusion and the changing of policy and the changing of names constantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister completely ignored the evidence of damage to Australian families after 10 years since the tax summit. This government deliberately engineered the worst recession in 60 years, which did massive damage to Australian families. One million people ended up on dole queues because of this government's deliberate policy of engineering a recession. Families and family businesses were ruined by what this government did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have the legacy of disastrously high youth unemployment&mdash;25 per cent to 30 per cent youth unemployment, which is a tragedy for many Australian families&mdash;which the minister completely ignored. We still have among the highest real interest rates in the Western world, which directly affect Australian families who are paying very high mortgage payments. Many of them are losing their homes as a result and many of them, as we have been reading recently, have negative equity in their homes after 12 1/2 years of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She completely ignored the tax record of the government. It is interesting to look at the budget papers for this coming year. We note that individuals' income tax went up 8.8 per cent in 1994-95 and is forecast to go up another 13.6 per cent in the next financial year. That is all paid by Australian families. What happened on sales tax, which is also all paid by Australian families at the end of the day? It went up 10.7 per cent in 1994-95 and is forecast to go up another 13.4 per cent in 1995-96. They are massive tax increases all paid for by Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Access Economics report today on the tax record, and I remind you what it said. `The total tax burden on workers is greater now than it was 10 years ago today when Paul Keating unveiled his tax reform package. Australians are paying more in indirect taxes than they would have under the coalition's goods and services tax,' that study reveals. The record is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had continuing wholesale sales tax increases. We had the disastrous increase in sales tax on vehicles&mdash;a direct broken promise in itself, a broken promise which will mean that Australian families now have to pay $1,000 more to buy an ordinary Australian vehicle like a Falcon or a Commodore as a result of this government's policies. The legacy of this government is $100 billion debt that this government has accrued which ultimately has to be paid for by Australian families. The record is a disaster and the record will mean that this government will be defeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I will tell you what you have done. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that sales tax on cars would stay permanently at 15 per cent. Now that we have the KST, the Keating sales tax, it has gone up from 15 per cent to 22 per cent. On luxury cars, sales tax has gone up to 45 per cent. On wine and cider sales tax has gone up to 30 per cent from 20 per cent. Domestic items like refrigerators, washing machines, heaters, stoves, toasters, mixers, kettles, percolators, fans, et cetera, have gone up 20 per cent in sales tax. Hygiene and health items like toothpaste, toilet paper, sunscreen, soaps and detergents are up 10 per cent&mdash;and you are talking about the great record of this government!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an increase of 6.7 per cent on videos, televisions, radios and tape recorders. They are all up from 30 per cent to 32 per cent. These are the items you have brought in. You are taxing families out of existence and you know that. That is what has come in as a result of the last budget. You have put up so many of these taxes that they will now rip another $14,000 million from Australian families&mdash;four times as much as in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures Senator Murphy gave before were quite false. We now have four times the sales tax that we had in 1982-83. Sales tax when Labor came to government represented only $17 a week for a family, but this year the Keating sales tax will rip that $14,000 million from Australian consumers. That is four times as much from every family since you came into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The KST, the Keating sales tax, is a consumption tax. He promised to oppose a consumption tax at the 1983 election. Since then tax has jumped by 50 per cent. Senator Murphy should not come in here telling us what the taxation was on families when we were in government, when the Keating government has lifted it from $17 a week to now $14,000 million. It is four times the amount. It is now $800 a head per year. If we had not blocked that plan, it would have been $200 million more than that. So do not come in here and talk about things that occurred 12 and 14 years ago. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Panizza this day, relating to taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>In taking note of that answer, Senator Evans supported the misconception, I believe, espoused by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) that the superannuation guarantee is not regarded as a tax. I wonder whether he has confused the superannuation guarantee and the superannuation levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he is talking about the superannuation levy he may have an argument. To work out which is regarded as a tax and which is not, apply the income tax test. If something is allowable against your earnings, then it is not regarded as a tax. If it is disallowed, it is defined as a tax. In the case of superannuation&mdash;it is added wages that an employer pays and sends off to a superannuation company&mdash;if the employer does not do that or there is a shortfall, then the superannuation guarantee comes in. That then becomes a tax and the employer cannot claim that as a tax deduction. You cannot have it both ways. I believe that whatever is taken off an employee and employer by law should be regarded as a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best I can do at this stage is quote from a letter from our Treasurer, Mr Willis, published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employer contributions to superannuation funds under the Superannuation Guarantee are not included in taxation revenue figures&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>even though they go straight to the tax department&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for Australia because the OECD defines taxation revenue to include only social security contributions which are paid to a government institution.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contributions under the Superannuation Guarantee are paid to private sector superannuation funds where they provide investment capital from which retirement benefits to employees eventually arise. These contributions are not available for the Commonwealth Government to use for its own purposes and are therefore, appropriately&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is in his view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">not defined by the OECD as taxation revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social security contribution schemes of other countries that you allude to are paid to government for the purposes of government providing social security benefits, on a pay as you go basis. They are no more than hypothecated tax, and are rightly treated as such by the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something I would like to question. The point is paying the levy to a private superannuation fund is simply like the government contracting out to the private sector, and the private sector generally does it better&mdash;in fact, I believe it does it better all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when this government, or any government, decides by law to take money away from an employer or an employee and put it in a private institution to do a job that the government eventually has to do&mdash;that is, provide pensions&mdash;then, by providing superannuation instead of a pension, that should be regarded as a tax. When you properly lump that together, you will find that we rank about the middle of OECD countries, no matter what sort of excuses the government makes in comparing us with any of those other OECD countries. That is where we finish up because that money is compulsorily taken from employers and employees and goes to those institutions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to French nuclear testing in the South Pacific region and the export of uranium to France.</PARA>
<PARA>I begin by pointing out that President Chirac has said that Australian uranium finishes up in French nuclear bombs. He asked, `If you are so concerned about our nuclear weapons tests, why do you provide us with uranium that finishes up in our bombs?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) has said that President Chirac is a liar. Actually, he said that he was misinformed but, essentially, he implied that President Chirac told an untruth. I believe that, on all the evidence, President Chirac is telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans is relying on a piece of paper, the NPT, when he knows very little about the actual administration of the NPT. For instance, as we will show later in the week when we get some more evidence to support this, France, as a nuclear weapons state, has a civil program which technically comes under the NPT and the International Atomic Energy Agency inspection process, but at the same time has a nuclear weapons program which is excluded from the NPT and the IAEA inspections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will produce evidence later in the week which will show that due to that conflict of activity within the same facility&mdash;that is, using low enrichment uranium for the civil program and high enrichment uranium for the military program&mdash;the IAEA inspectors are excluded from carrying out comprehensive inspections. It is quite conceivable, even theoretically, that under the NPT and the IAEA inspections, Australian uranium can find its way into nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want Senator Evans trying to confuse the issue by saying that we are trying to identify uranium atom for atom. We are well aware of the fact that when a batch of uranium goes in for enrichment, it may be 10 per cent uranium from Australia and 90 per cent from somewhere else. When it comes out, 10 per cent might go into civil programs. But based on the evidence we put before the Senate as long ago as 1989, we are arguing that after that process, uranium scraps from Australia, clearly labelled as such, were swapped with highly enriched uranium which went into the military program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have produced direct evidence to this Senate and I called on Senator Evans to pick up on that. Is he saying that the evidence we produced as long ago as 1989 was wrong? The evidence was well corroborated and well authenticated that at that stage Australian uranium was finding its way into the French military program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware that there are clauses in the NPT which, confusingly, require nuclear states, states with nuclear technology and nuclear facilities, to share those with states which do not possess that. Many of us in the anti-nuclear movement for decades have been pointing out the stupidity of having both an exploitative and expansive set of clauses built into a facility which should be actually controlling an activity. There is a conflict of interest in there. I wonder whether, in the recent renegotiation of the NPT, the Australian government sought to remove those clauses which so confuse the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out again that what the minister is saying is that he is not believing President Chirac, who has made a clear statement; he is believing the implementation of a signature on a piece of paper. I do not think that is justified. I think that Australia should desist from exporting its uranium to France, where it does find its way into French nuclear weapons. That is what concerns the majority of Australian people, and they want this government to stop that export. </PARA>

<PARA>What an extraordinary answer it was. Senator Crowley sought to tell this Senate that there was nothing wrong with child care in this country. Senator Crowley, against all facts, sought to tell the Senate that, in fact, Christmas carols were not being banned; grace was not being banned; there was nothing to worry about at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley disputed the fact that the government was seeking to have 560 child-care reviewers. She said that was garbage. Unfortunately, when Senator Crowley, the minister, put a message in the September issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accreditation Update</EMPHASIS>, she did not look at the page opposite her message. Her message was on page 2, and page 3 says `council needs 300 more reviewers to minimise delay in scheduling reviews'. They already have 260 reviewers; they want another 300 reviewers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simple mathematics&mdash;I know it might be very difficult for Senator Crowley: 260 reviewers plus another 300 reviewers makes 560 reviewers. That is a fact. Senator McGauran exposed that, and Senator Crowley had the audacity to come into this chamber and say it was not so. Either Senator Crowley does not have a clue what is happening in her portfolio, or Senator Crowley is trying to mislead the Senate. I am going to be charitable and say it is not the latter. I think the facts would suggest that it is probably the former, because Senator Crowley is absolutely abominable as a minister. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Statutory Rules 1995 No 55 being the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicle Standards) Regulations which are presently before the Committee. The proposed Regulations provide a set of standards, uniform throughout Australia, for the construction and performance of heavy motor vehicles and trailers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed Regulation 7 provides that the Minister may exempt a specified vehicle from a requirement of the Heavy Vehicle Standards on being satisfied after applying a number of criteria. Section 18 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act 1993</EMPHASIS> provides for the delegation of this power and the subdelegation of it thereafter. The exercise of the discretion may be of considerable commercial value. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether there is a right to an independent review of the exercise of this discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also draws your attention to the strict liability provisions. Proposed subregulation 9(1) provides strict liability in relation to the failure of a trailer to comply with a requirement in the proposed Regulations. Whereas it may be reasonable that the owner of the trailer and the driver of a vehicle towing the trailer should be subject to strict liability, the Committee notes with concern that "the owner of any motor vehicle towing the trailer" would be subject to the same liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that in some circumstances, according strict liability to the owner of a vehicle may be unreasonable. Under the proposed subregulation in its present form, the owner of a stolen vehicle which is then used to tow a trailer which does not comply with the proposed Regulations, would be guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of up to $2000, if an individual, or $10,000 if a body corporate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is similarly concerned about the strict liability accorded to "the owner of a motor vehicle forming part of the combination" in subregulation 10(1). Again, if the theft-and-unauthorised-use situation is applied it is possible that an unreasonable result may follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice in respect of the strict liability provisions. In particular the Committee would welcome your advice as to whether the strict liability of owners of vehicles in the circumstances described above may be avoided.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) has been in contact with the Committee about these matters. I trust the NRTC's response and proposed action adequately addresses the concerns of the Committee.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories are adopting national arrangements such as those included in the Heavy Vehicle Standards and Oversize and Overmass Vehicles Regulations into existing State/Territory legislation pending finalisation of the integrated road transport legislation. It is therefore important that the reform process continues to progress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In formally responding to the Committee, I would like to support the action proposed by the NRTC in relation to review arrangements and strict liability provisions of the Heavy Vehicle Standards and Oversize and Overmass Vehicles Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to clarify the procedures for the review of decisions to apply in the ACT and Jervis Bay Territory in the short term, appropriate provisions will be included in proposed regulations to replace the Heavy Vehicle Standards Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review arrangements in relation to oversize and overmass vehicles are to be included in regulations which are currently being developed. The new regulations will integrate the requirements of the existing regulations with those for restricted access vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the Committee's concern to provide protection against unfair consequences resulting from the application of the strict liability provisions, it is proposed to attach liability to the "operator" of the vehicle rather than the "owner". States and Territories will continue to apply existing prosecutorial and judicial discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments outlined above will be submitted for consideration by the Ministerial Council for Road Transport in accordance with the Heavy Vehicles Agreement. The Department of Transport will ensure that these amendments are progressed expeditiously.</PARA>

Nevertheless, the Committee would be grateful if similar undertakings and assurances could be given by the Minister for Transport who, the Committee understands, is responsible for the administration of the relevant parent Act. I would be grateful if you can arrange with your Minister to give the Committee such an assurance. The reason for seeking this additional assurance is that the regulations are part of a uniform national legislative scheme, which presents particular challenges for legislative scrutiny committees. These challenges have been recognised in the Administrative Review Council Report on Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies and in the discussion paper Scrutiny of National Scheme Legislation and the Desirability of Uniform Scrutiny Principles, drafted by a working party of Chairs of scrutiny of legislation committees throughout Australia. Also, both sets of regulations will commence upon notification in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> by the Commonwealth Minister.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary Secretary</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Statement to the Senate on scrutiny by the Committee of regulations implementing a national uniform legislative scheme</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among the instruments of delegated legislation scrutinised by the Committee to ensure compliance with personal rights and parliamentary propriety are instruments made as part of intergovernmental schemes, including those intended to implement national uniform legislation in a particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such legislation presents special challenges for legislative scrutiny committees. These challenges were recognised in the key Report by the Administrative Review Council on Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies, in the establishment by the Western Australian Parliament of the Standing Committee on Uniform Legislation and Intergovernmental Agreements Committee and in the circulation earlier this year by the Chairs of scrutiny of legislation committees throughout Australia of a discussion paper on Scrutiny of National Scheme Legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances scrutinised regulations which were made as part of such a uniform national scheme. The scheme in question was given effect at the Commonwealth level by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Road Transport Commission Act 1991</EMPHASIS>, which included as a schedule an agreement between the Commonwealth, all States and the Australian Capital Territory. The agreement recited that there should be improvements to road safety, efficiency and administrative costs; and that this necessitates uniform or consistent legislation throughout Australia, to be achieved by a cooperative legislative scheme. The agreement further recited that the essential element of the scheme was that the Commonwealth would make law for the ACT which would be the model for legislation by the States and Northern Territory, which in turn would enact laws consistent with the model. The agreement also established a Ministerial Council, the approval of which was necessary before the model law could be made. The approval of the Ministerial Council is also necessary for the amendment of the model law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first Commonwealth legislation as part of the scheme was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act 1993</EMPHASIS>, which expressly provided that it forms part of the national scheme envisaged by the National Road Transport Commission Act. It further provided that its purpose was to empower the making of laws for the Australian Capital Territory which are intended to be adopted by the States and the Northern Territory. The Act did not itself include any substantive provisions dealing with vehicles or traffic, instead providing that regulations may be made in respect of these matters. It was these regulations which are the legislative basis of the scheme as it affects users and which came before the Committee in the same way as other Commonwealth regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first module of the uniform scheme included the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicle Standards) Regulations </EMPHASIS>and the<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> Road Transport Reform (Oversize and Overmass</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Vehicles) Regulations</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">.</EMPHASIS> The heavy vehicle regulations include seven pages of what might be termed substantive legislation and one hundred pages of technical engineering standards. The oversize and overmass vehicles regulations include nine pages of substantive legislation and forty seven pages of engineering standards. Both sets of regulations apply to the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory only, but each expressly provides that their purpose is to provide a set of standards uniform or consistent throughout Australia. Both Explanatory Statements advise that the regulations will be incorporated into the law of each of the States and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee scrutinised these regulations in the usual way and found that several provisions were cause for concern. The most important of these were provisions under which vehicles may be exempted from the prescribed standards. Such exemptions, which may apply to individual vehicles, could have commercial benefit for operators. There appeared to be, however, no provision for independent review of decisions adverse to vehicle owners or operators. The Committee normally would consider that review of administrative discretions which may confer a commercial advantage is essential. In addition, one of the sets of regulations provided for strict liability offences, for which the Committee usually seeks an explanation. The Committee raised these matters formally with the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, the Hon Neil O'Keefe MP, responded to the Committee's concerns on 6 June 1995, attaching detailed advice from the National Road Transport Commission. The Committee considered the reply and requested further advice on the issues of concern. The Parliamentary Secretary replied on 29 August 1995, advising that appropriate review provisions would be included in proposed new regulations to replace the present provisions and that the strict liability provisions would be amended to meet the Committee's concerns. The proposed amendments would be submitted expeditiously to the Ministerial Council. In the meantime, the present regulations would not be commenced until the Ministerial Council agreed to the new regulations. The Parliamentary Secretary also arranged for additional material from the National Road Transport Commission to be sent to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Normally the Committee would regard this reply as entirely satisfactory and the Committee congratulates the Parliamentary Secretary on his commitment to ensuring that delegated legislation provides the highest possible safeguards for personal rights. In this case, however, the Committee wrote again to Mr O'Keefe. The reason for this is that while the Committee accepts undertakings from Ministers, who are answerable in Parliament for their actions, the Ministerial Council, which under the uniform national scheme must approve the amendments, is not directly answerable in this way. The Committee therefore asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he could arrange for the Minister for Transport to give similar assurances, both sets of regulations providing for commencement upon a date notified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> by the Commonwealth Minister. The Committee also requested a report in three months on progress with the new regulations. In addition, the Committee wrote to the Chairs of State and Territory legislative scrutiny Committees describing its actions in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Secretary then replied to the Committee, confirming that he had the authority to act on behalf of the Minister in this matter and that neither set of regulations would commence before the Ministerial Council agreed to the replacement regulations. The Committee accepted this reply but agreed to keep the matter under review, the present sets of regulations being only the first module of a number of successive modules to implement the entire national scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have reported to the Senate in some detail on this matter because of the unusual procedures mandated by the national uniform legislative scheme under which these regulations were made. These procedures, required by an agreement between the executives of the Commonwealth, States and mainland Territories, in effect oblige the Commonwealth to make delegated legislation under a Commonwealth Act only with the approval of a Ministerial Council and not to amend that legislation without similar approval. The Committee agreed that the agreement would not constrain its usual scrutiny of the regulations and, with the helpful cooperation of the Parliamentary Secretary, Neil O'Keefe, I am pleased to report to the Senate that undertakings have been given in respect of the regulations which ensure that the high standards of the Committee are maintained. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Radiocommunications (Multipoint Distribution Station Licences-Regional Licences) Guidelines No.1 of 1995 which were before the Committee at its meeting on Thursday 1 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Guideline 17, the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) may impose or vary the conditions of licences without regard to nearly all the other provisions of the Guidelines. Guideline 18 states that holders of licences are to be involved in the alteration and consent process and must agree before the Guidelines may be breached. The only holders who may be involved in the process, however,  are those holders of licences whose services, in the opinion of the SMA, may be affected by the variation or imposition of a condition under Guideline 17.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether the exercise of the discretion conferred on the SMA in Guidelines 17 &amp; 18 is subject to an independent review on the merits. Specifically, does a licensee, who is not invited to participate but who believes that it will be affected by any possible breaches of the Guidelines have a right to have the SMA's exercise of the discretion independently reviewed. The Committee notes that review of the exercise of this discretion by the AAT does not appear to be explicitly covered by sections 285-292 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radiocommunications Act 1992.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee draws your attention to further matters in relation to the Explanatory Statement and the attachment thereto. First, both documents refer to the Guidelines incorrectly by omitting a word, being the first of the "Licences". Second, in the quotation of section 108 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radiocommunications Act 1992 </EMPHASIS>on pages 2-3 of the Explanatory Statement subsection 108(3)(c) has two subparagraphs labelled "(i)" and no "(ii)". Third, it is the attachment to the Explanatory Statement, and not the document described as the Explanatory Statement, which actually contains the detailed explanations for each Guideline.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 1 June 1995 about the Radiocommunications (Multipoint Distribution Station Licences&mdash;Regional Licences) Guidelines No. 1 of 1995 (the Guidelines).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee sought information on whether the exercise of the `discretions' conferred on the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) in Guidelines 17 and 18 are subject to an independent review on the merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can advise that while the SMA does not consider it is exercising `discretions', the decisions it makes under MDS Guideline 17 can be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under section 292 of the Act. While a number of the Guidelines refer to the existence of particular facts or circumstances, the SMA does not exercise `discretions' under the Guidelines. Rather, under section 112 of the Act, the SMA is required to comply with the Guidelines when exercising its powers to impose or vary Multipoint Distribution Station (MDS) licence conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also sought information on whether the right to an independent review of a decision can apply to a licensee who believes that it will be affected by a decision of the SMA, but which was not identified by the SMA as an affected party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA advises that compliance with the Guidelines by the SMA is relevant to the exercise of the SMA's power under paragraph 107(1)(g) of the Act to specify particular conditions in an apparatus licence. The SMA's compliance with the Guidelines is also relevant to the SMA's power under section 111 of the Act to impose further conditions on a licence or to revoke or vary existing conditions. Under section 288 of the Act, any person affected by a decision under either of those provisions may request the SMA to reconsider the decision, and if dissatisfied with the result on reconsideration, may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under section 292 of the Act for review of the decision. This would include the holders of any type of apparatus licence whose services may be affected by a decision by the SMA, in reliance on Guidelines 17 and 18, to impose or vary licence conditions without regard to other of the Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee identified some typographical errors, in the Explanatory Statement and its attachment. These errors are noted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also indicated that it is the attachment to the Explanatory Statement, not the document described as the Explanatory Statement, which actually contains the detailed explanation for each Guideline. While the detailed explanations are referred to as an attachment, they form part of the explanation of the Guidelines and are not a separate document to the Explanatory Statement. The format adopted has been recommended by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for Explanatory Memorandums to instruments containing detailed technical material and is for the benefit of interested persons who require an overview of those instruments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter dated 22 June 1995 in which you responded to concerns raised by the Committee in relation to certain aspects of the Radiocommunications (Multipoint Distribution Station Licences&mdash;Regional Licences) Guidelines No.1 of 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 29 June 1995, about the Radiocommunications (Multipoint Distribution Station Licences&mdash;Regional Licences) Guidelines No. 1 of 1995 (the Guidelines). You asked how the words ". . . in the opinion of the SMA, may be affected by the operation of an MDS or other transmitter. . . ", which appear in Guideline 18, could be construed as anything other than a discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its letter of 1 June 1995, the Committee sought information on whether the exercise of the discretions, conferred on the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) in Guidelines 17 and 18, are subject to an independent review on the merits. In my reply of 22 June 1995, I advised that decisions made under these Guidelines were reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I also indicated that the SMA considers that it does not exercise discretions under the Guidelines. This means that the SMA does not exercise discretionary powers under the Guidelines; such powers are exercised under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radiocommunications Act 1992</EMPHASIS> (the Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA advises that the formation of an opinion such as that required by Guideline 18 is, generally speaking, of no import or effect if it is not coupled with some further action such as the exercise of a power, be it statutory or executive. It is for this reason that review provisions are directed at the exercise of statutory powers, rather than specifically at the formation of the state of mind that is to precede the exercise of powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the SMA drew the distinction in this case so as to make clear to the Committee the reasons why the Guidelines did not themselves contain the relevant review provisions. In other words, the SMA was seeking to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that, in the case of the licences that are the subject of the Guidelines, the criteria for the exercise of the powers in sections 107(l)(g) and 111 of the Act are contained in Guideline 17, whilst the relevant powers are contained in the sections themselves. This is a somewhat unusual circumstance but is one dictated by the form of the Act itself, as section 112 of the Act provides for statutory criteria to be imposed by means of disallowable instrument, in this case, the Guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA advises that, although it is conceivable that in some circumstances the formation of the opinion without a corresponding exercise of power could be of some import or have an effect, such circumstances would be relatively rare. For example, if licensees were to avail themselves of the statutory conciliation process to deal with alleged interference between services, the SMA could be asked to provide an opinion on whether one service might interfere with another. That opinion could then be of some importance in the conciliation process and directly or indirectly affect the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I advised earlier, the exercise of the powers of the SMA to impose and vary licence conditions under sections 107(l)(g) and 111 of the Act is reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is through this mechanism that the question of whether the statutory criteria for the exercise of those powers have been met, may also be reviewed. I trust that this explanation meets the Committee's concerns.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dire need for federal government and mining industry intervention to halt the death of wildlife, risk to groundwater and destruction of native vegetation caused by the toxic tailings dams of the gold mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I thank my colleagues for supporting the motion in a spirit of bipartisanship. Today I am calling for the federal government to act with urgency on the enormous environmental problems associated with goldmine tailings dams&mdash;also known as impoundment areas, concentrator residue impoundment areas or slime dumps&mdash;in Australia. There are at least 164 such goldmine tailings dams in Australia and a great proportion of them do not fulfil the federal government's own statement of best practice environmental management in mining projects. This is an inadequacy which can and does have enormous ecological consequences for wildlife, ground water, vegetation and human health in the area of the tails dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1.5 square kilometre tailings dam of North Ltd's Parkes goldmine in New South Wales, shown on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dam of death</EMPHASIS> on Sunday night, is only one example. At this tailings dam up to 2,000 protected native birds&mdash;swans, ducks, cormorants&mdash;were poisoned by the highly toxic cyanide gas, which is produced by an unstable tailings dam, which the birds ingested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The birds, being nomadic, tried to land in the water of the tailings dump, water that undoubtedly looked to all intents and purposes like habitat, comprising as it does a surface area of open water and wet mud, islands and remnant and regrowth vegetation. Cyanide levels in this dam were measured at 525 parts per million, despite company assurances that normal levels were 50 parts per million and never exceeded 300 parts per million. A dose of 100 to 200 milligrams of cyanide is lethal to humans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cyanide, also known as hydrocyanic acid or prussic acid, is most commonly recognised as the gas used for human execution in gas chambers. It is a fast acting poison and caustic agent that prevents animal cells from being able to absorb oxygen by inhibition of the enzymes that reduce oxidised cytochrome in cells. Once an animal&mdash;whether human, bird or otherwise&mdash;ingests cyanide gas, dizziness, nausea and finally loss of consciousness follow. Death&mdash;usually painful&mdash;occurs within minutes after contact with the gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lake Cowal goldmine project also proposed by North Ltd and featured in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> report on Sunday might is 100 kilometres south of the Parkes mine. This project, currently under environmental impact assessment, is proposing to build not one but four tailing dams, covering a total of 2.4 square kilometres, on the edge of one of the most internationally significant wetlands and bird habitats in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Windara mine near Laverton was the site of the death of 60,000 budgerigars killed by cyanide gas from the mine tailing in 1985. In the goldfields, toxicity problems are not monitored and could be a source of similar environmental catastrophe in the future if the problem is not addressed by this government immediately. International examples include the Ok Tedi case of the BHP goldmine on the Fly River, which is well known, and the Omai goldmine in Guyana, which on Saturday 19 August experienced a tailings dam collapse where huge amounts of cyanide and copper were leached into the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More accurately, the people of Omai experienced the tailings collapse. An estimated 90,000 cubic metres of cyanide loaded water from the tailings washed into the river per hour and then into the Essequibo River on which the people of Omai rely for drinking. The leakage was let run unchecked by the company for five days before it was sealed, by which time four million cubic metres of tailings water was in the river. Immediately, the World Health Organisation's health and environment adviser was called and warned residents along the river to stop using the water for cooking or drinking. Aquatic life along the Omai and Essequibo rivers was described by the adviser as being completely destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the cyanide problems involved in negligently constructed tailing structures, mine tailings dams are highly saline. One of the major discrepancies between the government's current best practice guidelines for tailings dams and the design of tailings dams in the field is the issue of the use of lining membranes on the perimeters of the dam. The great proportion of currently operative and proposed tailings structures are not lined. This problem was highlighted in a keynote speech to the Third International Conference on Environmental Issues and Waste Management in Energy and Mineral Production in Perth in August 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of being unlined, both the highly toxic cyanide compounds and the salt from the tails water soak through the floor of the dam and into the watertable. The ramifications of this effect are threefold. Firstly, salinity in ground water limits the possible uptake of water by vegetation on the perimeter and surrounds of the dam. It is reduced in the roots of plants, particularly tall eucalypts, because the salt concentration gradient between the soil and the plant root that is necessary for osmosis to continue is unbalanced or reversed in the presence of this highly saline soil and the osmosis stops. Often plant root cell membrane damage results from causing water to move out of the plant through the roots, and the plant dies and dries out. This occurs even in the salt tolerant plants found in the goldfields, and eucalypts can die within days of their roots coming into contact with the high concentration of salinity from leaked tails water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the cyanide contained in tails water absorbed by the soil pollutes ground water that may be accessed by nearby towns and mining camps, having potentially fatal effects. Thirdly, the leakage of cyanide in goldmining areas can have an economic effect, in that it chemically reacts with any gold in the soil and makes it unable to be extracted. If successfully managed, a tailings impoundment can be a relatively minor hazard. It is the instability of tailings dams that causes the leakage of lethal cyanide gas and the lack of proper containment facilities that creates the dangers of salinity and cyanide filtration into the soil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An awareness of these problems is outlined in the government's own statement on best practice, yet these practices are almost unanimously shirked by proponents of the mining industry. Although the mining industry is at present spending a good amount of their budgets on mine revegetation, little is being spent on addressing the issues of lifetime tailing stability, acid waste drainage, lateral and vertical leakage of contaminated water, and the dangers to fauna and birds that use the area as habitat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The North Ltd Lake Cowal proposal is only one example of the arbitrary lack of concern seemingly reflected by the mining industry with regard to the ecological dangers of goldmine effluent. Even proposing to build a tailings structure on a wetland such as Lake Cowal indicates this in stark relief. The issues associated with tailings dams in Australia are of such environmental significance that the Greens (WA) and their supporters feel a national inquiry into goldmine tails structures is necessary and will be pursuing avenues to begin this process immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this issue has arisen because of the segment on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program on the Nine Network on Sunday night which focused on a significant kill of native birds in a tailings dam at the Northparkes mine in central western New South Wales. That mine is operated by North Ltd, a major Australian mining company. I too am very concerned about the contents and the images on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes </EMPHASIS>program and about the company's admission that about 2,000 birds have been killed in the company's tailings dam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apparent lack of proper care for the environment at the Northparkes mine does give me cause for concern about the company's proposal to develop a new mine at Lake Cowal, which is some 150 kilometres south of the existing Northparkes mine. Lake Cowal is an important wetland, as it is a significant drought refuge when other parts of the state are dry. It is utilised by a large number of water birds. Many species of water birds actually breed at Lake Cowal. The lake also supports a commercial fishing industry when the lake is full. Lake Cowal is listed in the directory of important wetlands in Australia. It is not a listed Ramsar site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would be particularly concerned about the possible introduction of cyanide and other compounds into the water table or the surface waters of Lake Cowal. I understand that the Lake Cowal mining proposal would involve the use of tailings dams and cyanide, which would obviously clearly have the potential for damage. I understand from officers in my own department that there have been other significant kills of native birds from cyanide poisoning in tailings dams in other parts of Australia. Obviously, there are a lot of tailings dams associated with the goldmining industry in this country. In fact, some 100 tailings dams exist here. I understand that there have been native bird kills in the goldfields of Kalgoorlie and also in other goldmining areas as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have been informed, it is a relatively simple management procedure to prevent native bird deaths from cyanide in tailings dams by minimising the amount of water that is stored in tailings dams and minimising the concentration of free cyanide in the tailings dams to a level of less than 50 parts per million, which is not harmful to wildlife. Given the cost of cyanide, I would also assume that mine managers would be keen to recycle and reuse as much of this cyanide as possible. Two relatively simple procedures&mdash;bird deaths on tailings dams and a risk of bird kills&mdash;could obviously be significantly reduced. I hope that those with responsibility for mine management would take account of those measures and others that might be able to be utilised to ensure that we do not face the similar situation that occurred at Northparkes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear from the content of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> television program that these basic procedures were not implemented at Northparkes and, as a consequence, these bird deaths occurred. I am concerned that the industry&mdash;which naturally wants to be seen as environmentally responsible and wants to improve what I think is a relatively poor public image&mdash;is again being seen to be not doing the right thing, and I must say that that is disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues of ground water and Australia's goldmining industry are of great significance not only to those with an environmental consciousness but also to the community in general. I understand that with good design, construction, management and monitoring, tailings dams should not be a source of major ground water contamination in this country. Again, it is in the best interests of all responsible mine managers to ensure that their tailings dams are well designed, well constructed and well managed so that the industry does not leave a legacy of ground water contamination for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some native vegetation is destroyed by the construction of tailings dams and other infrastructure that is associated with mines, such as roads, workshops, processing plants and so forth. However, it is the responsibility of the Australian mining industry to satisfactorily rehabilitate all areas disturbed by its activities. We need to acknowledge that the Australian mining industry&mdash;in particular, the goldmining sector&mdash;is important to our economy, but mining does have an environmental impact. It is a matter for the industry and the community to work together to ensure that we have a sustainable industry that is environmentally responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to encourage the mining industry to improve its environmental performance, my department recently entered into a partnership with the Australian mining industry to encourage best practice environmental management in mining. Recently, I launched nine booklets and a video, and they have been well received by the industry and government and community groups not only in Australia but also overseas. It is unfortunate that we are debating an issue which should not have arisen and which can only harm the industry's reputation and have tragic consequences because of the wildlife that is killed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that this fundamentally is a responsibility of state governments. I have received some preliminary information from the office of the New South Wales Minister for Mineral Resources about the issue canvassed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program, and I will be writing to my counterpart in the New South Wales government to seek further details on this incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am very concerned about the incident&mdash;which I assume is the reason for this motion being moved&mdash;and about a number of other reports of bird deaths from tailings dams, I cannot agree with the words in Senator Chamarette's motion, which talks about, `The dire need for federal government and mining industry intervention'. I propose an amendment to the motion, which I hope will be acceptable to Senator Chamarette and other senators in the chamber&mdash;but time will tell. My proposed amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Federal and State Governments to continue to work together with the mining industry to avoid the death of wildlife, risk to groundwater and destruction of native vegetation caused by the toxic tailings dams of the gold mining industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the urgency motion proposed by Senator Chamarette and to endorse a number of remarks made by both senators who have spoken on this motion. Like Senator Faulkner, I have some concerns about the way Senator Chamarette's motion is worded. Again like Senator Faulkner, I too have a proposal to better tailor the motion to what I think the reality of the position is. However, the coalition strongly supports the sentiments behind the motion and the concern that Senator Chamarette has expressed about the effect that toxic tailings dams can have on wildlife, ground water and vegetation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion, as I said, could probably be better worded. It does not mention the responsibilities of state government, which, as Senator Faulkner said, does have the prime responsibility in this area, and it does not mention the responsibility that individual companies have to observe the law and the regulations under which they are established. So, as I have mentioned, I have slightly reworded the motion and I will seek to move an amendment at the end of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that the Australian community expects companies to observe the highest possible standards to protect our environment. Clearly, what we had at Northparkes mine was an environmental stuff-up of considerable magnitude. It should be recalled that the establishment of Northparkes mine came after an EIS, an environmental impact study. Under current state acts of parliament, the establishment of mines comes only after the appropriate EIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EIS, which is conducted prior to the establishment of a goldmine, typically sets out the conditions under which the goldmine will operate. The EIS stipulated, among other things, I understand, that the tailings dam would not contain toxic levels of cyanide. Unfortunately, it is now very clear that there was clearly a weakness in the company's environmental management system which led to toxic concentrations of cyanide in the tailings dam, the results of which were spelt out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is also worth noting that the company has taken, I understand, rapid remedial action. Among other things, it has written to the Minerals Council of Australia and indicated that it has changed the type of ore being processed to reduce the cyanide usage. It has purchased a hovercraft to commence daily monitoring of the dam and to rescue and deter birds from the dam. It has purchased a propane gas gun to deter birds and has investigated ways to reduce the cyanide levels in the dam quicker than achieved through the cyanide neutralisation plant. It is clear, as one would expect, that the company has moved to rectify the situation, which should never have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the incident at Northparkes mine was in breach of the agreement under which the mine operates. It may seem harsh, but in many ways, I suspect, you could say the company deserved to cop it&mdash;and cop it, it did. It is also worth recording that the company denies that it was involved in a cover-up of the situation which developed at the mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mining companies themselves have a prime responsibility to ensure that their own activities do not pollute the environment and, among other things, pose the types of risks that are set out in the motion. Apparently, at Northparkes mine in New South Wales, the cyanide content of the tailings dams reached high levels which resulted in some 2,000 bird deaths. Birds such as teals, ducks and seagulls alight on the tailings dams and, on ingesting the cyanide-rich water, have died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cyanide increase in the tailings dams apparently resulted from mining lower grade ores. The company says that, when it became aware of the problem, it stopped the process and put neutralisers in the dam to prevent more deaths. I am pleased to hear that the company has apologised for the deaths. The managing director, Mr Swan, has said that the company takes the issue very seriously and very much regrets the deaths. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The company has stated&mdash;and I do not know whether Senator Coulter will be able to add more to this&mdash;that none of the deaths were of threatened or endangered species. But none of this is to offer any excuse. There is no doubt that companies have to be eternally vigilant in these areas and the community expects no less. Even companies which believe they meet the higher standards cannot rest on their laurels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested when reading the press cuttings relating to this event that Northparkes copper mine was named as a winner of the 1994 award for environmental excellence in New South Wales and was presented with such an award. I think it demonstrates the fact that even companies that believe they have taken a lead in this area and have set high standards simply cannot rest on their laurels. Clearly, we can assume that is what happened with the resulting deaths of those birds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue was also raised by a number of other speakers that there have been deaths of birds at other tailings dams. I think Senator Faulkner drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that cyanide in tailings water at goldmines located near wetlands can be a threat to migratory birds. Desert wildlife and bird life generally remain close to permanent water supplies but, in times of drought or bushfires, the birds sometimes have to find other supplies of water and feed, otherwise they would die through lack of water or starvation. Therefore, they are sometimes attracted to tailings dams. If they go to tailings dams which are toxic, death can result as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that previous deaths have been recorded at the Granites, Tanami and Warrego mines in the Northern Territory, so it is not a problem which is confined entirely to this particular site. It is an issue which mining companies have to effectively address. The industry itself has to make sure that it works with state governments and other responsible people to ensure that deaths of this type are minimised, if not entirely eradicated. I am pleased to hear that the Minerals Council is looking at a number of ways in which it can better address the question of cyanide and its effect on wildlife management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there is an issue which Senator Chamarette has brought to the attention of the Senate. I think companies these days that do not observe high environmental standards do pay a community price, and that price has been paid by Northparkes mine. I think all of us would agree that these things must be avoided in the future and that companies themselves have to be eternally vigilant in this regard. I now foreshadow the amendment I will move to Senator Chamarette's motion. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the vital need for Governments, mining companies and the mining industry to ensure that tailings dams of the gold mining industry do not lead to the death of wildlife, pollute ground water and unnecessarily destroy vegetation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several issues that come out of this matter of the death of birds, not only at this particular site in New South Wales, but, as Senator Chamarette has pointed out, in a number of other sites around the world. Of course, it impacts on human health as well in Guyana and a number of other places. The level which was mentioned in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program, which I think both Senator Chamarette and Senator Faulkner mentioned, of 520 parts per million of course would be low compared with the original level in the water. Cyanide is one of those things that classically are quite easily oxidised and almost certainly the levels would have been much higher than that had they been mentioned earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are a couple of things that come out of this matter, though. The first one is that, no matter how well you do EISs, when companies do EISs and present them, there is no guarantee whatsoever that the information contained in those EISs is even reliable, let alone that the imposition of standards through the EIS and assessment process will in fact be observed. I think in this case we have probably seen a company that has been very slick with its advertising, has in fact won some awards and got away with it. Unfortunately for it, of course, it has got caught out and I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program showed that quite nicely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I make a plea; it is a plea that has been made often enough in the past. Environmental impact statements need to be made independently of the proposers of projects, they need to be independently assessed, and there needs to be independent monitoring, not monitoring by the companies of their own operations. I think that comes clearly out of all these cases of pollution of tailings dams with cyanide and the death of birds and the other environmental impacts that we have seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point I wanted to pick up this afternoon was touched on incorrectly, briefly by Senator Faulkner when he talked about the sustainability of mining. Of course, when we are mining minerals, we are in fact carrying out an unsustainable activity, by definition. These are non-renewable resources, and I think it is very interesting that we are having this debate today, the day after we saw the World Bank figures which showed that Australia, on a per capita basis, is the richest country in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at lunch time at that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program, I noted that the company was saying that the gold from its existing mine and its proposed new mine at Lake Cowal would net $250 million and $150 million, respectively. The point I want to make, the point I want to stress, is that those are not real figures. Those are the capital values of the gold whether it is in the ground or whether it is taken out of the ground. There is no value whatsoever in mining that gold. That gold will still be there in 10 years, in 20 years, in 100 years time if our children or our descendants want eventually to mine it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Senator Gareth Evans an important question yesterday, and in response he gave me this booklet `National Balance Sheets of Australia' which shows that the Australian Bureau of Statistics had attempted, quite incorrectly, to make some assessment of the capital value of Australia's assets. The whole point about this is that we should be keeping different accounts. What we have seen in this case is massive pollution, massive environmental damage in an area which could go on producing benefits for generations of native animals, of native plants, of Australians for thousands and thousands of years, measured against the immediate exploitation of a non-renewable resource which, if the accounting was done properly, would simply show that we had shifted $250 million out of our bank balance as a resource in the ground into cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the accounting done properly, the accounting done as every business in this country would do its accounting, namely, keeping a capital account and a cash flow account, one can readily see that in this particular case we have the exploitation of a non-renewable resource for very, very little value whatsoever&mdash;actually, the value added to the gold in extracting it, not the value of the mineral in the ground, and at the expense of enormous environmental damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the accounting done in that proper way, we see that we should not be engaging in these mining operations. So we support the motion. We support it for perhaps stronger reasons than have been adduced so far and we strongly recommend that, coming out of this whole exercise, the EIS process be revisited.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few brief words to say about this matter. I support the amendment but I also have some concern not only about the mining industry but also some other industries as well. I think this particular case demonstrates how some people in this industry do not follow the rules. North Broken Hill, I think, are a classic example. From my point of view, it not only demonstrates their lack of concern for the environment; it is a bit like their effort in terms of industrial relations. They recently were caught out cutting down National Estate forest in Tasmania&mdash;and it would not be for the first time either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the companies do know the rules of the game and the government, or governments&mdash;really, this is a responsibility of state governments&mdash;set down rules for environmental purposes and they ought to be followed. Even if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program was only half right&mdash;probably it was only half right&mdash;it gives cause for concern about the fact that this company allowed the wildlife, in this case birds, to continue to die without really following it up to any great degree. I think that is a sad reflection on the industry, which is a very important industry to this country. We have to get from our industries more responsibility in environmental matters. Whether or not it is the correct thing to do to try to lay the blame on the federal government or at least to say that the federal government ought to do something about it, we have to have a wider look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not that long ago that there was an environmental issue raised on Groote Eylandt in respect of BHP. In the whistleblowers committee a number of submissions were made on environmental matters. That raised a serious concern about how companies operate. Effectively, companies are given a very significant right in this country which allows them to either mine or harvest certain natural resources and it is about time that they followed up that right that is given to them by giving some respect to the environment and demonstrating that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are some companies, probably the majority, that clearly do that. They do act in a proper and appropriate way. But there are those others, such as the one I have mentioned, that would seemingly not do that. I think it is very unfortunate that a particular company, one of the largest resource companies operating in Australia, would choose to be so defiant or would choose to act in such an improper way that it would lead to a motion being moved in this place about the risks to wildlife, ground water or about the destruction of native vegetation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time something was done about it. We do have to bring about greater responsibility. I do not know that any inquiry Senator Chamarette is proposing would achieve that. I think, as Senator Faulkner outlined, it is the responsibility of state governments. I think there is a role for both governments to try to ensure greater adherence to environmental laws and to the requirements in terms and conditions of leases that are set down. I hope that as a result of the program shown and others there may be a greater effort to work towards that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to contribute to this debate because I share with Senator Chamarette two things. The first is that we both have the privilege of living in Western Australia, which is a state that has in many respects been built on the back of a very significant gold industry. The second thing I share with Senator Chamarette is a very serious and long-term interest in ensuring that our environment is protected from degradation and spoil in the course of economic development. I have always been committed to that and believe that most of the Australian society demands a very sensible balance between economic development and protection of the environment, unlike Senator Coulter, who has now left the chamber but who believes that goldmining is an unsustainable activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In what could only be described as fairies at the bottom of the garden type economics, Senator Coulter said that gold is worth the same in the ground as it is out of the ground. The reality is that you actually have to go through the process of getting the gold out of the ground to make it worth anything. In many parts of Australia and through generations of Australia's history, the balance between extracting gold from the ground and the price you get for gold is one of the crucial determinants in Australia's national financial success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the pleasure over the Christmas-New Year period of 1994-95 of reading a book my dad gave me for Christmas, that being the most recently updated book by Geoffrey Blainey entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rush That Never Ended</EMPHASIS>, which is a history of Australian mining with a specific reference to gold. From just flipping through it in the minutes I was waiting to make my contribution to the debate, I picked out a few paragraphs from Geoffrey Blainey's 1963 introduction to that history that I think should be placed on the record and placed in stark contrast to Senator Coulter's contribution that mining is unsustainable. Mr Blainey says in this introduction:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of the ground came wealth that created new industries. Humble silver and copper companies so prospered that they founded Australia's heavy chemical industry and one of the world's large iron and steel industries; they made paper and fertilisers and paints and built aircraft and ships. Wealth from Australian rocks created financial dynasties in London and Melbourne, and a fortune from Queensland gold was indispensable in finding Britain's rich oilfields in the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian prospectors found or pioneered new mining fields from the Rand and Rhodesia to New Zealand and the Klondike. Australian mining investors opened Malayan tinlands and New Guinea and Fiji goldfields, and there is hardly a mining field that has not used Australian innovations in metallurgy.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect Senator Coulter would not have wanted some of those important contributions to the world economy from Australia's goldmining and mining industries to have occurred anyway. He probably would not want a heavy chemicals industry or, indeed, oil exploration in the Middle East. The reality in world history is that Australia has been a leader in mining. Mining technology that has been founded, created and innovated in Australia's goldmining industry has been exported to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the silver linings to the cloud of North Ltd's Northparkes mine is that where you do have a catastrophe&mdash;that is the only word that can be used to describe the loss of so many thousands of native birds and the risks to other important parts of our native vegetation&mdash;it is ensured through this sort of focus, and I congratulate Senator Chamarette quite sincerely on raising the matter in the Senate, that public awareness is raised. Also, there is an increase in the pressure on those who do seek to exploit Australia's mineral resources to do so in a very responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the Australian mining industry has been able to export to the rest of the world is the technology the minister was talking about earlier&mdash;the engineering expertise to ensure that, when you build things like tailings dams and when you do things like creating all sorts of mines, you have the technology and the engineering expertise in the environmental sciences, which are flourishing in Australia. You build up an enormous store of knowledge and information that is an exportable commodity. Australia's mining engineers and environmental scientists are now winning enormous amounts of work all across the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another reason I support the now entirely agreed set of words. It is important that the mining companies themselves&mdash;I think Senator Murphy made this point very well&mdash;have a very strong sense of responsibility. I am sure they do. I do not think North Ltd would have set out at the EIS stage of the mining operation or at the feasibility stage, or at any stage of the development of this mine, to have a tailings dam that would have the environmental consequences that have very unfortunately occurred during the past few months. I am sure they earnestly sought to ensure that such devastation did not occur. I am quite sure that with their proposed dam at Lake Cowal their good intentions will also be there. Good intentions are simply not enough when you are dealing with sensitive environmental matters. There is no doubt that in a wetlands situation the potential for environmental damage is very high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important that the governments of Australia participate. In that I refer to all levels of government because I know that in my home state of Western Australia local government, particularly in the Kalgoorlie area, does have a very specific interest in environmental matters relating to mining and exploration developments. The mining companies these days do have a number of matters they need to take into account. I think the market is very well informed about the potential financial impact on mining companies of these sorts of environmental disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my research for this debate today, I came across a press clipping from 24 August. It related to an enormous cyanide spill in Guyana in southern America. Something like 1.25 million cubic litres of cyanide spilled into the Essequibo River. That created an enormous threat to not only the wildlife, the fish and the other life in and around that river, but also the population of something like 18,000 people who live on and around that river and who rely on that river not only for drinking water but also for the sustenance of their farms and animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The share price of the US and Canadian based companies that were the major shareholders in that mine plummeted by 24 per cent on the first day of trading after that mining incident took place. That shows the market is aware that when a company is involved in an environmental disaster it will be required to invest enormous sums of money in either a clean up or in future activities to ensure that such things do not happen again, that that has a massive impact on the company's financial environment. There is an enormous financial responsibility on companies to be responsible to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments do have an important role. State governments have the prime role in these environmental impact statements. The federal government, as the minister has said, has played a constructive role, and I congratulate the minister for the work that the CSIRO and the Environment Protection Agency, which brought out 10 best practice and environmental management papers in a series, have done. They can have a constructive role and, as I said, local government has a role, too. Companies have a role and the industry has a role. I think the Australian mining industry has, as the minister said earlier, done a lot in recent years to ensure that it overcomes what has been a very poor public perception of its environmental management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Western Australian senator, I have had the opportunity to go to many mining operations in Western Australia, both as a private citizen prior to coming into parliament and as a senator on a number of parliamentary inquiries. Recently, I think we have all seen&mdash;I have certainly seen&mdash;the enormous effort mining companies have put into environmental management. As I said earlier, that technology is intellectual property that Australia can export to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution of these matters as pertains to the disaster that took place at Northparkes recently will, as I said, have a silver lining to it. It will ensure that management of tailings dams will need to be better in the future. It will ensure that, where a company is required not to allow cyanide levels to reach toxic states, that will have to be more closely monitored. It will ensure that when tailings dams are built the floors of those dams, whether they be clay or some sort of plastic, are not going to be penetrated and cause risk to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the sorts of things that happened at Northparkes should never have to happen, but in the real world they do happen. It is a matter of how we can learn from these things and how working together with industry, with companies and with other levels of government can ensure that they do not happen again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few brief remarks on this particular matter, first of all, because these events occurred in my home state of New South Wales but, secondly, and more generally, because I believe we can learn something about the development of environmental policy in all areas from this unfortunate incident at Northparkes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said to the Senate many times, but it bears repeating, that goldmining is an extraordinarily valuable industry as far as this country is concerned. If you take steaming coal and coking coal together, they are our No. 1 export at $8 billion, but gold is our No. 2 export at $5.3 billion every year. It is a major industry and one that is certainly not going to go away and one that we should be quite rightly concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been enormous growth in gold mining. For example, in Australia in 1987-88 there were 119 tonnes of gold mined. This has gone up to about 260 tonnes of gold in 1994-95. There is tremendous growth in goldmining in Australia, quite apart from its significance as an export. I think some history will help us better understand the unfortunate circumstances that happened with North Ltd's Northparkes mine where some 2,000 birds, the company itself has admitted, were killed by its tailings dam&mdash;2,000 birds which included significant numbers of endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to go back to the introduction of the gold tax in 1986, something which I remember very clearly because I was working as a stockbroker at the time and I was buying and selling mining company shares. What happened in 1986 when the Labor government decided to introduce a gold tax or proper taxation on gold companies was that there was an enormous scramble amongst gold mining companies to mine very high grade ore. That rush continued from 1986 until 1990 when the tax was finally effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What then happened was that these companies had to find some way to maintain their earnings for their shareholders and they had to mine lower and lower grades of ore. To give you an example of that, in 1986 it was reasonable for a mine to be mining some five grams per tonne of gold in its ore. That is a very tiny amount of gold and a very large amount of ore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at what is happening today, the Telfer mine, which is a major mine, is now operating on just over one gram per tonne and it has been able to do that with the increasing use of more sophisticated technology. In this case, it is cyanide leaching technology. Cyanide, to anyone, is a highly reactive substance and is very dangerous, indeed. There has been pressure, in other words, on the gold companies to use new technology and this has led to the sorts of risks we have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem will not go away. ABARE has forecast there is increasing demand for gold. It is a major source of export earnings. Companies have to maintain their dividends so it is natural that there will be an increasing use of technology to deliver these sorts of results. I think that is the point from which we should take some lessons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to do is better understand how industry works to come at these problems not just from the environmental protection angle, which is where this problem has landed in our lap, or from heritage considerations where people are concerned about the value of the natural environment but also to anticipate what companies are going to do&mdash;what sort of technologies they are going to use which are going to lead to these sorts of degradations. In that respect, the motion before the Senate is entirely appropriate because unless we address things in this fashion what we will have is the perpetual situation where we are closing the door after the horse has bolted and that serves no-one any good at all. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about today is not an isolated incident. We have had mentioned by a number of people other dams in which birds have died. I am a bit concerned about the comments of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) that he was aware of about 100 tailings dams throughout Australia because the reality is that in Western Australia alone we have about 164 known gold tailings dams. In parts of the Pilbara there could be many more that have not been traced or located yet because of the nature of some of the operations. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994 (the Bill) was introduced in the House of Representatives on 8 December 1994. On 8 February 1995, the House of Representatives referred the Bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities (the Committee) for consideration and an advisory report. The Committee's report was tabled in the House of Representatives on 2 March 1995. The House of Representatives subsequently amended the Bill to take account of the Committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Bill was introduced into the Senate on 23 March 1995. On 23 August 1995, the Senate referred Items 1 to 4, inclusive, of Schedule 4 of the Bill to the Committee for inquiry and report. The Committee's report was tabled in the Senate on 30 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The Government thanks the members of the Committee for their willingness to take the reference at short notice, and for providing their report in such a timely fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Together with the Committee, the Government acknowledges the valuable contribution made by those persons who appeared before the Committee to give evidence, and who provided written submissions to the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Items 1-4 of Schedule 4 to the Bill introduces a new distinction between large and small proprietary companies. The concepts of exempt and non-exempt proprietary companies are to be abolished. Currently, exempt proprietary companies must prepare annual accounts, but are not required to have them audited or lodged with the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). A non-exempt proprietary company must lodge audited accounts with the ASC. (A proprietary company whose shares are held by a public company or a foreign company is non-exempt.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The Bill will require large proprietary companies to lodge audited accounts with the ASC. A proprietary company will be `large' if it satisfies at least two of the following three criteria:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the consolidated gross operating revenue for the financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is $10 million or more</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the value of the consolidated gross assets at the end of the financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is $5 million or more</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the company and the entities it controls (if any) have 50 or more employees at the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Under Corporations Law subsection 313(2), the Commission may relieve a company from compliance with specified requirements of the Law relating to the audit of accounts. Corporations Law subsection 313(11) defines the circumstances in which the Commission may make an order under subsection 313(2). They include the circumstance where compliance with the requirements would impose unreasonable burdens on the company or a class of companies. Therefore, if to require certain large proprietary companies to comply with the audit requirements of the Law would impose unreasonable burdens on those companies, the Commission will be able to make an order relieving those companies of the obligation to comply with those requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The Committee noted concerns that the audit requirement to be imposed on large proprietary companies by the Bill may not be justified in some cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The Committee made the following recommendation to address this concern:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill be amended to provide that in exercising its discretion under section 313 of the Corporations Law to exempt a large proprietary company, or class of large proprietary companies, from the audit requirement the Australian Securities Commission should have regard to, but not be limited by, the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the expected cost or burden of audit;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the expected public interest or benefit of making this information available;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the number of creditors;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the nature and extent of a company's liabilities;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether it is the first year the company is required to prepare audited accounts;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether the company is one which is likely to repeatedly move in and out of the large proprietary category over a period of years.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation. It proposes that the Bill be amended to require the ASC to have regard to the matters identified by the Committee in the exercise of its discretion to relieve a large proprietary company of the requirement to have its accounts audited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. The Committee indicated in its report that it anticipates that the ASC will exercise by way of a class order its discretion to exempt large proprietary companies from the requirement to appoint an auditor. The Chairman of the ASC, Mr Cameron, indicated to the Committee that if the Bill were passed in its present form the ASC would engage in full public consultation to identify appropriate classes, which would in turn be publicly exposed for comment. The Committee made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the exercise of the ASC's discretionary power in the manner described in Recommendation 1 be made subject to a process of public consultation and scrutiny. The Committee also recommends that the ASC include in its Annual Report details of how it has complied with its procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. The Government agrees that class orders should be made following a transparent consultation process, and that the ASC should include details of this in its annual reports. The Chairman of the ASC has advised the Attorney-General that in the exercise of this discretion the ASC would adopt a process of public consultation and scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. The Committee considered that the small/large distinction and the criteria for granting exemptions should be examined in the light of their application in practice and of the need to ensure that companies of significant economic importance meet higher reporting standards. It also considered that the cost to the commercial community of the exemption process should be reviewed. The Committee made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three tests contained in the proposed section 45A, the criteria for exercising the ASC's discretion, the exercise of that discretion and the effectiveness and cost of the process be reviewed by the government and this Committee after a period of two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. The Government agrees that these matters should be reviewed after a period of two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. The Committee considered that a large proprietary company may face difficulties in meeting the audit obligation if the obligation is imposed some time after the commencement of the company's financial year. The Committee made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the delay in the commencement of the legislation, the Committee recommends that the Bill be amended to defer the commencement of the audit obligation on large proprietary companies until the 1996-97 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. The Government acknowledges the Committee's concern, and proposes to amend the Bill to provide that the first financial year for which large proprietary companies must have their accounts audited is the first financial year that starts after the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. Currently, exempt proprietary companies are not required to lodge their accounts with the ASC if they appoint an auditor. Some of these companies will be large proprietary companies after the Bill is enacted, and will therefore have to lodge audited accounts with the Commission. To avoid undue disruption to the commercial arrangements of these companies, the Bill proposes that existing proprietary companies which have their annual accounts audited, which are large and which elect to continue operating under the existing rules (`grandfathered companies') will not need to lodge their accounts with the ASC (proposed subsection 317B(3)).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. The Committee supported proposed subsection 317B(3) in its report of 2 March 1995. However, the Committee reconsidered the matter in light of the evidence presented during its recent reference. In its report of 30 August, the Committee referred to concerns that proposed subsection 317B(3) would allow a business already being audited, and coming within the large category, to be indefinitely exempted from lodging financial statements. The Committee made the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst not within the Committee's terms of reference, the Committee considers that the proposed section 317B(3) (the "grandfathering" clause) in the Bill be amended to include a sunset period of three years from the date of commencement of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. The Government notes that Recommendation 5 was not within the Committee's terms of reference, and that persons who would be adversely affected by this recommendation were not given an opportunity to comment on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason, the Government considers it would not be appropriate at this stage to amend the Bill to include a sunset period for proposed subsection 317B(3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. However, the Government recognises the need to closely monitor the impact of proposed subsection 317B(3) on affected persons and companies. The Government therefore proposes that the operation of subsection 317B(3) be reviewed after it has been in force for two years. This could occur as part of the same review, recommended by the Committee and accepted by the Government, of the operation of the small/large distinction for proprietary companies.</PARA>

<PARA>This bill is an incredibly complex area of legislation because it is an amending bill, amending a 1982 bill which itself has a number of schedules. Parts of this proposed legislation impact on other legislation. Some of it is picked up elsewhere, in matters not strictly before us today.

The clause in the amending bill proposes omitting the subsection, substituting words to the effect that the designated authority must from time to time, as soon as it is practicable to do so, prepare a document setting out a number of particulars, which it lists. Our amendment is to the effect that the designated authority must from time to time, but not less frequently than every 12 months, prepare a document setting out certain particulars. </PARA>

<PARA>Turning to page 57 of the amending bill which is before us, proposed subsection 53(2) suggests that we omit `in the person's possession'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand this amendment is proposed by the Democrats as part of a package to address the trade in oriental medicines within Australia and it aims to remove any defence of ignorance of the law as it would apply to the possession of oriental medicines. It is my view that the existing subsection 53(2) in no way offers such a defence. The defence that the existing subsection 53(2) offers is ignorance of the illegal importation. This is an ignorance of fact and not an ignorance of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised that under existing subsection 53(1)(a) all that the prosecution has to prove is that the defendant had a specimen in their possession that was imported in contravention of the act. The prosecution does not have to prove any fault element on the part of the defendant for a successful prosecution. To avoid conviction, the defendant has to prove that they did not know and had no reasonable grounds of knowing that the specimen had been imported in contravention. In other words, the defendant has to prove that they had no criminal intention in relation to the offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of Senator Coulter's amendment would be to remove this defence capability from the defendant, thereby leaving the defendant open to prosecution regardless of whether criminal intent existed in the mind of the defendant. Considering the high level of penalty that is available under section 53&mdash;five years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000&mdash;it would be most inappropriate to remove this defence provision from the act. I ask you to think about that as you consider the appropriateness of your analogy to a speeding fine, and I think you might think again.

However, these are maximum penalties. There is no minimum set in here. It is well within the discretion of the judge hearing a particular case to take these matters into account. Clearly, if somebody was acting deliberately and flagrantly in contravention of this act, then one would hope that the matter would be dealt with seriously and there might be a five-year gaol period, or a $100,000 fine, or both.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The particular concerns that have been raised with us relate very much to therapeutic goods, as has been mentioned, and the fact that there is still a very flourishing trade in relation to oriental medicine, particularly Chinese medicine. A number of the products which are offered for sale contain, or purport to contain, a number of CITES-listed species such as bear, leopard, musk, deer, rhino or tiger, and this has already been mentioned. Many species of these five groups of animals are listed in appendix 1 of CITES. The most demand for their body parts is by medicine. That constitutes one of the principal threats to a continuing survival of those animals in the wild. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of factors were found to be contributing to this illegal trade, including inadequate levels of targeted law enforcement effort, confusing non-comprehensive laws for the possession and domestic sale of illegally imported endangered species and the lack of a coordinated and culturally sensitive education campaign, which is something that Senator Chamarette has already mentioned, to inform the traditional and Chinese medicine using community of the legal and conservation implications of the continued importation and use of endangered species medicines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern here is that there is an element involved in the offering for sale of these materials, which is in itself a great stimulus to the continued exploitation of these species and which goes beyond the mere possession.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Kemp and I also agree with his sentiments that a new offence relating to the sale of illegally imported specimens would assist in the restriction of trade in oriental medicines. That is a laudable one. I say to Senator Coulter that it is unnecessary. I have been advised that the creation of such an offence would result in the prosecution having to prove more than is currently required under the legislation. The word `sale' includes the concept of possession. Possession is already covered under the present legislation and an addition would weaken the act. Such a section relating to sale of illegally imported specimens would require the prosecution to produce proof of the defendant taking action to dispose of the item for the purposes of reward as well as having to establish beyond any doubt that the item was illegally imported.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am always very loath to be involved in the creation of yet another criminal offence because I believe wholeheartedly that gaol penalties do not deter and they do not change people's attitudes and minds if they are deliberately engaged in criminal actions.

<PARA>These relate to the export of live native freshwater fish. Let me read from a letter which was sent to Senator Faulkner in March of this year by the Humane Society International. Michael Kennedy, writing the letter, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At our recent meeting with you in Canberra, during the Peak Conservation Organisations week, we discussed the issue of exporting live native freshwater fish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had explained that during the consultation process with conservation NGOs, almost two years ago, for the preparation of amendments to the `Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, 1992', agreement was reached to "Amend the Act to restrict the commercial export of live fish and invertebrates to material that has been bred in captivity" . . . This corrected an anomaly which permitted such exports, despite a longstanding Commonwealth prohibition on exporting live native animals. We stress, that this was accepted as appropriate policy by the Wildlife Protection Authority (WPA) of ANCA. The agreement to allow exports of "captive-bred" native freshwater fish was a compromise agreed to by TRAFFIC and WWF, in order to secure the export ban.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On February 1st, HSI received a draft proposal from WPA, prepared by the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries, for approval to export live native freshwater fish for commercial purposes (for the export aquarium fish trade). Apart from the fact that the application is for a "Controlled Specimens", and not for a full "Approved Management Program", which, in the view of HSI, is not acceptable for live native fauna, this appeared to be in direct contradiction with the agreed amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, currently awaiting passage through Parliament. As noted, these amendments, or so we thought, sought to plug an unintended loophole in live native fauna export laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANCA had often mentioned to us that they were concerned for the practicalities of implementing an essential ban of live native freshwater fish exports, though HSI did not agree that there were any insurmountable problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, during these irregular and brief discussions, we were never informed that the amendment had, as it now seems, been removed well over one year ago. Part of the reason for HSI's concern for the delay in the passage of the amendments, and for which we urged your intervention, was the need to see the freshwater fish export ban imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary reasons that ANCA now forward for omitting the amendment are as follows: 1. That it is not possible under the Act to differentiate between prohibitions on native freshwater fish and control methods for other marine fish species; 2. That such a prohibition would impede the ability of ANCA to instigate further export controls on marine fish exports; 3. That permitting such exports would lead to better conservation of native freshwater fish in Australia. ANCA now also renounced the previously and jointly agreed position that the current situation represents a legal and policy anomaly. They have taken a complete 180 degree turn in approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HSI rejects all these arguments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the support for these amendments. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TRAFFIC Oceania and the Worldwide Fund for Nature Australia, the two organisations that negotiated the amendment in question, also reject these arguments, as do the Peak Conservation Organisations. To briefly rebuff the ANCA arguments: It is entirely feasible, and indeed practicable, to list in the schedules to the Act, clear indications and definitions of the specimens of fish, freshwater or marine, that are exempt or not exempt from the operation of the Act; problems in dealing with the attitudes of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, or other state fisheries departments, are hardly a reason not to take appropriate conservation action; and suggestions that permitting exports will act as the best conservation mechanism are puzzling in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA>That last paragraph really is the summary of the arguments that have been put to the Democrats, and the arguments which we support in support of this amendment. That is the argument that the Humane Society International is putting and it is an argument accepted by the Democrats. It is evidently supported by a number of the conservation groups, and we see merit in it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banning the export of live native freshwater fish, although intended to address a supposed discrepancy in the act, will introduce additional anomalies. These arise from the discrepancy between the prohibition that would apply to the commercial export of live vertebrates and the fact that trade in live invertebrates and plants would continue to be permitted. It is difficult to see how the conservation of native vertebrates is dependent on a total ban on live exports while conservation of plants and invertebrates is not. </PARA>

Previously, leopard skin imports were illegal in Australia. As a result of the CITES management plans being completed for areas from which leopards come, we are now proposing to legalise leopard skin imports from these areas where there are the management plans. CITES recommended this. As it recommended that management plans should be in place indicating that leopards are listed as vulnerable by CITES, this amendment then says that they should therefore be available for imports.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hunting of leopards by Australians is usually in response to commercial safaris organised by Australian hunting and shooting groups, to send Australian people to Africa to shoot these animals in their natural, open woodland habitat for no other reason than what we would feel is gratuitous and barbaric sport. The money paid by Australian tourists in the country to take part in that activity more often than not goes straight into the hands of that country and the governments, not even to the local African landowners. We have to be aware that, while some people may say, `Barbaric though it is it assists those countries,' it does go into the hands of the country and it actually perpetuates a practice that I think on a global scale we have to evaluate in a different manner. </PARA>

While it may be that in a few small areas the leopard is being managed in a way which might allow some culling, I think, overall, this is a threatened species.

It is reducing the number of birds to two, but the schedule that Senator Chamarette is seeking to amend changes the period from three years to just immediately before export. It does seem to me, although I hear what the minister says, that that does open up the possibility that somebody might have acquired an animal from the wild immediately before leaving Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has not convinced me that the three-year requirement has been such an impediment. This amendment leaves a loophole for people to abuse the practice by labelling a native Australian animal a pet in order to engage in some kind of export trade. The minister has tried to reassure us that the limit would prevent that from occurring but, on the aspect of cruelty, if the minister wanted to dissuade me of this he would need to point out why three years is such an impediment. It seems things would be better left as they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We oppose the arbitrary definition that refers to the exporter having kept the animal as a household pet immediately before export. I know that as a lay person I am getting confused here but it seems to me that, while the minister is defending the transportation of a household pet, calling it an export only makes things more difficult. To be able to define as a household pet something you have in your possession seems to leave the way open for the transfer of native species overseas and cause the problems Senator Coulter referred to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some haste that I rise tonight to make a contribution to the debate on the adjournment, breaking a longstanding rule of mine not to enter into this debate. But in the course of doing some research into the Western Australian state government's workplace agreements&mdash;the industrial relations model that the Liberal state government has adopted in Western Australia which is based on individual contracts&mdash;I came across some quite concerning information with implications for this parliament and for the federal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian state Liberal government has been seeking to have workers in my state take up individual contracts and move out of the award system. The government has been driving a campaign to get those workers to take out individual contracts both in the private sector and in the government sector. They have been putting a great deal of effort into that attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that as part of that approach the Western Australian government has come up with a concept called `flexible remuneration packaging'. At first sight that would not seem to be a particularly big deal. Many employers offer salary packaging; there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that provided appropriate taxation is paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators would be aware that this government has a proud record of introducing the fringe benefits tax which helps to ensure that all elements of a remuneration package are taxed and that the tax avoidance measures that have grown up around salary packaging have largely been eradicated. If the benefits are not taxable in the employees' hands, the employers are taxed for providing that fringe benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have discovered that the Western Australian government has been offering flexible remuneration packages to many of its higher paid and senior employees within the health sphere. These packages are offered only to selected employees and the key element in this is that they are offered only to those who sign a workplace agreement&mdash;that is, those who are prepared to opt out of the award system and accept the individual contract approach that the state government has sought to introduce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those employees are allowed to sacrifice up to 30 per cent of their salary package. They can take their salary in other than cash benefits up to a maximum of 30 per cent. So, for instance, an employee who agrees to move out of the award system and sign a workplace agreement can sacrifice part of their salary and have their employer&mdash;this is essentially the state government&mdash;pay their children's school fees, mortgage repayments, superannuation payments into private superannuation firms or the lease of a private motor vehicle. There is a range of other options that are available. These benefits can be provided as long as there is no increase in costs to the employer. But the employer claims that this packaging will improve the employee's total remuneration package. So you have this situation where the employer says, `By salary packaging, you will be better off, but it will be at no cost to me, the employer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how is it that this inducement can be offered and a supposed advantage flow to employees without any cost to that state government, the employer of these people? Simply put, it is because of tax evasion. The state government is encouraging the avoidance of payment of tax by its employees. It has erected a tax avoidance scam. The scheme induces employees out of their award system into the workplace agreement on the basis of helping them to avoid paying the appropriate tax on their incomes. For those senators who would be&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator Panizza</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How do you work that out?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that, Senator, because they are quite blatant about it. The documentation that the state government are circulating to employees states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act and Income Tax Assessment Act regulates and defines the type of benefits that you can package and how they are treated for taxation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain Health Care Units in the Government Health System are exempt from Fringe Benefits Tax, therefore flexible remuneration packaging can be an attractive option for some employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act provides that Public Benevolent Institutions (PBIs) which include some Health Care Units are exempt from payment of FBT on benefits provided to their employees. This means that employees can receive the following benefits on a NO FBT and NO PAYE Tax basis.</PARA>
<PARA>So the state government are quite clear that this is an attempt to avoid the proper payment of tax offered to select employees who will enter into their particular ideological scheme. It is aimed at getting people under workplace agreements and out of the general award system. It is a clear abuse of the public benevolent institution status of these health care units that the state government controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government are encouraging the avoidance of the payment of tax by their employees. They are deliberately setting up a scheme that will allow those employees to reduce the taxation that they would properly pay to the Australian Taxation Office based on their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government use the example in their literature of an employee whose current salary is $55,000 per annum. They point out that the current tax payable by that employee would be $17,222. But they say that, under their remuneration package that they will offer them, the tax payable will only be $9,709. Therefore, as they put it, this will increase the net remuneration to the employee by $7,513 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you have to ask is: how is that acquired? It is acquired by the evasion of that very $7,513 tax by that employee by virtue of the scheme erected by the state government. What you have is a situation where the government is constructing a system which abuses the status of those health care units and allows the employees to benefit, but only if they are prepared to enter into the workplace agreement scheme that the state government is so desperate to encourage and to claim support for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of federal policy concerns here that I think ought to be directed to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), and I have today written to the Assistant Treasurer raising my concerns&mdash;firstly, about the abuse of the public benevolent institution status and, secondly, on the effect of this in terms of the reduction in taxation to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question of a tax evasion strategy being given the imprimatur of a state government, I think, is of serious concern. It reduces the federal government's ability in its fight to make sure that all income and remuneration is properly taxed and that tax avoidance schemes are prevented from occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important element of this is that it increases the burden on other taxpayers. It reduces the amount of tax that is flowing to the Commonwealth. That means that other taxpayers, people who are not entering into these tax avoidance schemes, are required to pay a greater share of tax to fund the social services that the Commonwealth provides. It really is a bit rich for a state government that constantly whinges about the perceived reduction in the federal revenue that flows to the states to be erecting tax evasion schemes for selected employees to pursue its ideological and industrial relations goals at the same time as complaining about the lack of federal funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think there is a range of issues that flow from this. There is also the question, I suppose, about whether this scheme is allowing people to benefit from other government benefits that otherwise they would not be eligible for. By reducing their income, they may well fall below thresholds that may make them eligible for other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, there is a range of concerns about this scheme. It is not, for my part, an attack on people who have taken up this scheme. The government make it very clear that, if there were any change in the taxation arrangements or status, they would immediately pass any increase in costs or taxation on to the employees. So they have covered themselves and, I think, left the employees rather vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a very scandalous situation that we have a state government encouraging tax evasion. I know the federal coalition opposes the fringe benefits tax, but I did not know that the Liberal Party in Western Australia would go to this extent in terms of trying to avoid the proper payment of taxation by their employees. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a letter here from another student. This one is from the Sacred Heart College Middle School, Mitchell Park&mdash;again in my home state. Robert Morrissey, a student, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a concerned student of Sacred Heart College. We need you to do something about the 100 Million landmines that are lying dormant in over 30 countries in five continents. Each year there are around 1500 people killed or maimed by landmines. The majority of the maimed are forced to become amputees, these amputees cannot get a job so they just become an extra mouth to feed. This is economically bad for the victims families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of the mines are not made to kill, they are made to injure or maim people. An injured soldier slows down an army and spreads terror through those armies. Unfortunately landmines produce the same effect on civilians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost to produce landmines varies from six dollars to seventy-five dollars per unit. Recent reports by the "Africa Watch" and the United States counted no less than 37 types of landmines. Disposing of landmines can cost as much as 1000Dollars per unit and this makes it difficult for Third World countries to dispose of mines in their own country, let alone help in other countries. This makes it extremely important for First World countries to help.</PARA>
<PARA>I just comment on how many people out there are now sending messages similar to these to government. The petition that was delivered today to members of government was from a delegation made up of people including Archbishop Francis Carroll, Catholic Archbishop of Canberra and Goulburn; Bishop George Browning, Anglican Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn; Reverend Niall Reed, chairperson of the Canberra Presbytery of the Uniting Church; Bishop Patrick Power, chairman of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission; Janet Hunt, executive director of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid; and Sister Patricia Pak Poy, Australian network coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's decade of the 1990s is shaping up to reveal a concerted attack on the provision of a public education system as a matter of right and community responsibility. I make it clear that the Australian Democrats regard the right to a publicly funded secular education system as a basic feature of our Australian culture. It is not just an obligation because Australia is a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; it has been and ought to remain a fundamental component of that which characterises Australian nationhood. It ought to be something for which we as a nation&mdash;a nation which espouses principles of egalitarianism and social, if not Christian, responsibility&mdash;hold proud and something that we will defend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. We have almost thrown it away in our collective greedy mania for embracing economic rationalism as we replace the idea of public responsibility with principles of user-pays and market driven decision making. As governments spend less and less on education, schools are closed, teachers sacked and class sizes steadily increased. As schools are placed into an ever increasing bind, they turn to sponsorship and fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cynically, we have state governments which are creating the legislative frameworks that are meant to facilitate public schools in becoming increasingly financed from a system of user-pays under the guise of providing greater autonomy for those very same schools. My own state of Tasmania is a good example, having recently passed a new education act. Although this act has been hailed as landmark legislation providing new opportunities for parent involvement in the decision making processes of schools, it has clearly built the slippery slope towards a user-pays education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 41.3 of this new Tasmanian education act of economic rationalism allows school principals to set and impose charges for incidental costs and expenses. The only restraint is that, where there is a school council, such levies must be approved by the council. At the time of its enactment, however, far fewer than half of the schools had school councils. Even now, few of the parents realise that one of the fundamental responsibilities of the school council is to approve the school budget, levies and charges. In the absence of such a council, the principal decides on the need for fees and how much they will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some respects this sounds quite progressive; it seems like a mechanism for participatory decision making. In fact and in practice, it is a device by which the state government can off-load some of the odium of fundraising on to school councils&mdash;which in effect means the parents. There is no limit on the amount that can be imposed as levies and charges. That is supposedly the responsibility of the council, which may refuse to approve a budget. But here is the deadly punch: if the principal and the council fail to agree on the budget, it is the council which can be sacked by the minister. Moreover, there is no definition in the act of fees, levies and charges. There is no limit on the amount that can be imposed and no limit on the scope of their applicability. As the squeeze on education resources becomes tighter and tighter, the pressure for increased revenue from this source will be irresistible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently such fees are voluntary, or termed as voluntary, although it is noted and indeed explained that parents are expected to pay. It is not clear just what is to happen if a levy is not paid. The act does not describe what will occur in that instance. How long will it be before these charges are regarded as compulsory? With no limit to their scope, the capacity for such fees to become an increasingly central component of school budgets is frightening for those of us who regard the provision of education as a government responsibility. Is it too cynical to predict that, just as Hilmer is potentially the vehicle for facilitating a major leap towards user-pays in all manner of local government provided functions and services, so too the new education act will signal the end of the public education system? I think that has to be a rhetorical question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reminding the Senate that the Democrats believe that the Australian government has a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of our various states are not hoodwinked by their state governments and led into situations such as the one that I have described in Tasmania. We believe that the Australian government has a responsibility to ensure that education is delivered to all Australian children on an equitable basis. </PARA>

The ATO-wide program is now called `Managing Productivity through Health'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) Government policy welcomes and encourages the use of existing range facilities within Australia by United States (US) forces. US use of our ranges contributes to the level of interoperability between the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and US armed forces, further strengthens the defence relationship between our two countries and by contributing to the support of a US presence in our region, furthers our shared interests in the stability and security of the region. In accord with this policy, US forces have used the Lancelin Range on a regular basis since 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The US armed forces have expressed interest in using Lancelin Range to conduct major exercises and have been briefed on the range by Australian Defence personnel. The visit to which you refer was that of the Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Clemins, who visited Lancelin Range, accompanied by members of his staff, on Wednesday 31 May 1995. Vice Admiral Clemins was escorted by the Lancelin Range Officer who briefed him on the facilities. After viewing the range from the air, Vice Admiral Clemins advised that he considered Lancelin Range not to be large enough to conduct any major exercises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) There have been no exchanges of notes, letters, or contracts with the US forces over the use of Lancelin as a bombing range. The majority of activities on the range have been conducted as, or associated with, combined exercises between Australian and US forces, or with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN), in accordance with the ADF's scheduled exercise program. Occasionally, US Navy battlegroups transiting the area may request unilateral use of this range. Such requests are approved by me as required. If approved, arrangements are then made directly between US Embassy staff and Headquarters ADF. Local arrangements are made between the range management staff and other Australian military agencies, as appropriate. Use of the range by US forces is subject to full cost-recovery procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) &amp; (c) The present level of activity is expected to be maintained and there are currently no plans to increase the US usage of Lancelin.
