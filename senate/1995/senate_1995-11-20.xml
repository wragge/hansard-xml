<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome back Senator Evans, visiting Australia, and ask him in his capacity as the Minister representing the Prime Minister, to the background of the industrial turmoil experienced by the Australian community of recent times under Labor's law and practice and the national coalminers strike which is continuing today: why hasn't the Prime Minister condemned this industrial thuggery of union bosses which is hurting the interests of all Australians well beyond the parties to the dispute? Does the Prime Minister have no influence with Labor's Accord partners, the ACTU leadership, or does he just prefer to abdicate his responsibility in favour of his predecessor, Mr Hawke? Doesn't real national leadership demand more than a few phone calls on the way to the airport?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3267" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister's concern throughout in this matter has been to try to get this dispute resolved and also to address its underlying causes, not to grandstand and make political capital out of something that is potentially very damaging to the Australian economy if it is not contained. That is exactly the way in which his involvement in the matter has been proceeding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His involvement, as I understand it, began last Tuesday when he talked to the unions concerned about the basic position they had taken and his concerns about the way in which they were seeking to escalate what was an obviously legitimate ground of industrial difference into a matter of much larger national significance. As a result of that, he later talked to the chief executive officer of CRA, on Wednesday of last week, and that led to conversations for the first time for some considerable time between the ACTU secretary and Mr Davis, all of which was important in creating the circumstances for what subsequently happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those discussions, negotiations were entered into between Tim Pallas, the assistant secretary of the ACTU, and the CEO of Comalco, Mr Terry Palmer. Together they drew up a basis for settlement for further negotiations between CRA, including Comalco, and the ACTU. Included in that basis for settlement, which was reached on Wednesday night following the involvement of the Prime Minister, were agreements on essential principles: agreement by the company to drop litigation against individuals on strike in Weipa; agreement by the company on the principle of not discriminating against workers who choose to bargain collectively; agreement by the company to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value; and from the CEO of Comalco, in the context of assuring the Prime Minister that `We will sort out the details tomorrow'&mdash;which was the way he put it&mdash;agreement to report to the commission by 2 o'clock the following day. Faxing this agreement to the Prime Minister on Wednesday night, the ACTU assistant secretary said that the ACTU was confident this constituted an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where it was on Wednesday night following the intervention of the Prime Minister. For the Prime Minister to express on that basis the optimism that he did last week is perfectly understandable. The point is that the Prime Minister kick-started a process which has now followed through into negotiation between CRA and the ACTU and, more importantly than anything else, it has resulted in the matter now being dealt where it belongs&mdash;that is, in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief executive officer of CRA said on Thursday that he `welcomed the intervention of the Prime Minister in seeking a solution to the unnecessary widening of industrial action related to Comalco's operations'. CRA added&mdash;this is on Thursday&mdash;that it was willing to respond immediately to the PM's suggestion that it should enter into discussions with the ACTU; it was willing immediately to start proceedings in the AIRC to address the disparities which had arisen between award conditions at Weipa and those applying to people on staff contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of all this occurring, the matter did find its way into the Industrial Relations Commission through the intervention and involvement of the president on Friday night. There was a compulsory conference on Saturday. It was foreshadowed that, if that compulsory conference failed to fully resolve the issues, it would be dealt with by way of arbitration commencing today, and that is the basis on which the matter has proceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hawke's involvement has been limited to being involved as an advocate for the ACTU on the particular question of equal pay for equal work&mdash;the substantive issue which is now before the commission and being addressed right now. In fact, I think Mr Hawke, in his address to the commission, started in 1891; he is probably up to about 1920 by now, and I am sure it will be a very helpful contribution. But to talk in terms of Mr Hawke or anyone else other than the Prime Minister being involved in actually bringing this matter to a resolution is to completely misunderstand and to wilfully misunderstand the course of events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU said that it would make its best endeavours on Saturday to stop the coalminers going out, but it was not confident about that. It did say that it would stop the maritime strike going ahead, and it did succeed in doing just that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, all you really succeeded in doing is demonstrating the failure of the Prime Minister, but what we want to know is: why won't he condemn the leadership of the coalminers unions who are continuing this national strike whilst the matter is before the commission? Why does he simply attach blame to CRA, the company which at all times acted within the law? Doesn't the Prime Minister understand that national leadership in fact requires acting in the interests of all Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Prime Minister wants to do, and is succeeding in doing, is get this matter brought to a sensible and quiet resolution in the commission, where it needs to be. After his discussions with the trade union movement, he has already succeeded, with the help of the trade union movement, in getting the maritime strike off, and it is to be hoped that that will be the outcome so far as the rest of it is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as CRA's role in all of this is concerned, maybe it has acted, technically, within the terms of the act. That has not been denied. But it has certainly acted against the spirit of it. Even that voice of capitalist Australia, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, made that absolutely clear this morning, that there was ground to be concerned about the way in which the system was evolving, when it said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Bob Collins, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The minister would be aware of claims over the weekend by the federal opposition that the Prime Minister's statements regarding the APEC free trade agreement were `absurdly boastful'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of those very silly statements made at the weekend by Mr Downer&mdash;the person that the coalition wishes to inflict on Australia as its foreign minister&mdash;regarding the Prime Minister's role in those APEC negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Panizza interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator Panizza, Mr Downer clearly indicated that he is one of those people who, if he won tattslotto, would whinge about the price of the ticket. It is a fact that all of these put Australia first advocates in the coalition were praying for two results over the weekend: one, the escalation and deterioration of the industrial dispute at Weipa; and, two, the failure of APEC. Fortunately for Australia, and unfortunately for the coalition, neither of those things eventuated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of agriculture in the APEC trade and investment liberalisation agreement does have the potential to provide a substantial boost in confidence for Australia's farmers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers, of course, well understand the positive implications of what was achieved at APEC, even if Mr Downer does not. The President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr McGauchie, has congratulated the government for keeping regional leaders up to their commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation has estimated that our farmers stand to generate another $2.9 billion a year from more liberalised trade as a result of this agreement. This is in addition to the $1 billion a year of additional trade that is expected to flow from the successful outcome of the Uruguay Round. The NFF says this will be a major boost to all rural communities and will provide all states and regions across Australia with much needed additional export income. Mr McGauchie says that we must turn the Osaka agreement into tangible trade reform and ensure that all sectors, including agriculture, and all measures, including tariffs, non-tariff barriers and export subsidies, are gradually phased out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantive statements that have been made by a number of our major trading partners following the Osaka agreement are very heartening indeed in terms of their commitments to make substantial tariff reductions early in the new year following the agreement.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, which led the push to resist rural protectionism at APEC, wholeheartedly agrees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement by leaders in Osaka over the weekend is another milestone in the development of APEC. The action agenda provides for comprehensive coverage without exceptions. The commitment to the 2010-2020 end dates has been reaffirmed, with flexibility within this process to determine the pace of liberalisation for sensitive sectors. The agenda covers all tariff and non-tariff barriers as well as export subsidies and trade facilitation measures. Countries will now prepare individual action plans for submission in 1996. This is without doubt a major outcome for Australia and, in particular, its primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad suite of agriculture reforms introduced by this government since the early 1980s are resulting in the development of more efficient and market oriented rural industries. These reforms have been achieved in close consultation with all the major stakeholders&mdash;in particular, the National Farmers Federation&mdash;to ensure that this country's rural industries are well placed to take advantage of this trade liberalisation in the APEC region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Prime Minister and Mr Brereton have both made it plain that the Industrial Relations Reform Act will not be amended as requested by the ACTU. Why, in these circumstances, is Mr Willis still suggesting that `the government will be out there changing the law' to facilitate collective contracts? Does this indicate that the government is intending to cave in to ACTU blackmail? You have just acknowledged that at all times CRA has been acting in accordance with the law, and presumably you also agree that the striking workers are doing so in defiance of the IRC. Do you now acknowledge that workers do have the right to remain in the union under the law and under the CRA staff salary arrangements? In those circumstances, how can it possibly be said, as you just said a minute ago, that CRA has acted against the spirit of the legislation? When is Mr Keating going to show some national leadership and stand up for the interests of all Australians&mdash;not just trade union bosses, but particularly those who wish to freely enter into workplace agreements which they clearly regard as being in their own best interests? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What CRA has obviously been about is trying to squeeze unions out of the play, doing so in a way which was not contemplated in the terms of the legislation, by forcing people to accept individual contracts less than the awards; rather, it has done it by the more subtle and circuitous route of offering returns that are well above what they can achieve in terms of the current awards. But the net result of that process will be, if it is followed through to fruition&mdash;and CRA has undoubtedly hoped this would be the case&mdash;to create a situation where union members, one by one, drop off from their union membership and the union ceases to be, for all practical purposes, an effective voice in the enterprise bargaining for that particular company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter in issue was very clearly spelt out, as I say again, by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. If anyone is the voice of the business interests in this country, if anyone would be thought to understand business psychology and if anyone might be thought to adequately or accurately represent CRA's motivations in its editorials, it could be expected to be the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. What the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> says&mdash;I say again that it may turn out to be a mistake for union members to decide that their union membership no longer makes any sense in the face of these generous contracts&mdash;is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since it is always possible that the company, once its workforce is largely deunionised, will become rather more parsimonious.</PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that. Of course it is possible. We were not born yesterday, any of us. The habits of hundreds of years, of millennia, do not change in the way in which business enterprises are conducted. Interests remain at odds with each other. You do need protections built into the system to ensure that workers who individually have no power, as against collective corporate enterprises, will in fact have some capacity to apply that particular power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that particular context that the government has been concerned about the way in which the legislation has operated. It is in this particular context that the government is concerned to see a sensible outcome achieved on this matter before the industrial commission. It is for that reason that we are very pleased to see this matter now being litigated before the commission of what equal pay for equal work&mdash;that well-established principle&mdash;means in this new context. This is the industrial relations context in which this particular issue is being now fought out and it is a perfectly understandable concern that the ACTU, the union movement, should have and it is perfectly understandable that the government should have taken the position that it has taken in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand the nature of the principles that are involved here. We want to see these issues resolved in a way that does not create unfairness, particularly in the longer term, for the ordinary working people. We want to see an environment created, at the same time, where this does not become an explosive industrial conflict which will work against the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for all these reasons that we have approached the issue, and the Prime Minister has approached the issue, in the way that we have. He has not been concerned to act stridently or in any posturing fashion. He has been concerned to work away behind the scenes to identify the true matters at stake, to dissuade the parties from taking unnecessary industrial action and at the same time to persuade the company concerned about the necessity of it playing a little bit more in accordance with the spirit of the rules, not just the strict black letter. Because it is only by playing in accordance with the spirit of the rules, as everyone has been doing to the great advantage of this country for the last decade, that we can continue to get the kind of productivity gains out of the work force and we can continue to get industrial harmony and stability maintained in the way that has done so much for the good of this country. That is the basis on which we have been approaching this matter this week. To approach it in the way that you would do if you were in office, with all the attitudes that you have to these issues and your absolute contempt for the underlying interests of the work force, would be to do no more than, as everyone knows, throw a lighted match into a petrol can. That is not the way to conduct industrial relations; it never has been and it never will. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This book is an account of cultural change within Australia and within Australian families. While it documents fascinating differences in cultural and family values, it draws on similarities and consistencies&mdash;for example, the strong attachment to family, the importance of children, the expectations of strong family support and respect for age.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Does the government believe there is scope for banks to further reduce home loan interest rates?  Has the presence in the market of mortgage originators like Aussie Home Loans and lenders like the superannuation members home loans scheme brought more competition into the home lending market and put pressure on banks? In view of this more competitive market, should borrowers for home loans shop around in the market?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3274" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is true that those seeking mortgages to cover their home loans should shop around in this market. It is a more contestable market. If consumers use consumer power to cause greater competition, they will reap the rewards of that greater competition. They are already doing so by virtue of how the market is now developing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, the existence in the market of mortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans and lenders like the superannuation members home loans scheme are bringing that much needed competition to this market. For our part, the government will continue to point out that this is a competitive market. With consumers using their power and us using our influence, I am sure that the level of mortgage rates can be further reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Falling long-term mortgage rates and the unprecedented competition in the home loan market are indeed, as I have said, pushing down mortgage interest rates now. Since December 1994 the variable home loan rate charged by banks has been constant at 10.5 per cent, but the average interest rate being charged on the stock of loans outstanding has fallen from 10.01 per cent in December 1994 to 9.67 per cent in September 1995. The fall in the average interest rate reflects the increasing pressure on major banks from mortgage originators like Aussie Home Loans and lenders like the superannuation members home loans scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mortgage originators are now accounting for a growing share of new loans and their variable rate mortgages are around 1 1/4 percentage points below that of the major banks. Indeed, one company on its own, Aussie Home Loans, accounted for $2 billion of the $11 billion growth in home loans by all lenders between December 1994 and September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, for their part, the major banks are responding by trying to compete in the new loan market through such things as honeymoon loans. While projecting their margins on the large existing stock of mortgages by maintaining standard variable rates of 10.5 per cent, so-called honeymoon loans now account for over 20 per cent of the housing stock and are freely available at rates around 2.5 percentage points below the variable rate. The rate on honeymoon loans has come down from 8.4 per cent in May of this year to 7.9 per cent in September. I might just note that the Advance Bank has just announced a honeymoon rate of 7.75 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fixed rate loans account for around a quarter of all outstanding mortgages. The rate on a three-year fixed mortgage fell from 10.3 per cent in December last year to 9.6 per cent in September. At present, home buyers can get a three-year fixed rate mortgage at 9.25 per cent. In those circumstances, it is clear that this market is a more competitive market. There are gains for mortgagees seeking new mortgages to make the institutions compete between themselves and that is bringing the major banks under pressure. I certainly hope that that will mean that they too will enter more full-bloodedly into this competitive market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The winners in all of this are Australian home owners and those who borrow money to finance the purchase of their homes. Creating a contestable market such as this is fundamental to government policy to ensure that home buyers get the best possible deal from the lending institutions in the field.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about this decision and the message that it sends around the world regarding the US position on drugs in sport.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the United States Olympic Committee is responsible for the implementation of the competition testing program for Olympic sports in the United States of America. A number of sports work with the USOC to conduct out-of-competition testing, which is the most effective means of deterring athletes from doping. Unfortunately, sports are not bound to work with the USOC. At present, only eight out of 41 sports participate in the USOC out-of-competition testing program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about this situation and am fully aware that Australian athletes have reservations about the lack of effective testing in the US.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the USOC's recent decision not to introduce a new and effective out-of-competition testing program is disappointing, this does not mean that US Olympic athletes will avoid appropriate testing programs.

But the point is, as the Prime Minister was saying yesterday and throughout, indeed, the negotiations leading up to the final passage of the Osaka action agenda, there is going to be an absolutely phenomenal increase in the demand for agricultural produce in this region as a result of the economic growth within the region, the improving standards of living flowing from that growth, and all the other consequences that we can already begin to measure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is, of course, the point about these APEC meetings: the real momentum for change has to come from within the domestic economies themselves. The best way of ensuring that that momentum occurs is for there to be top down driving of the process in each country, with the mutual support and reinforcement that flows from leaders having the sense that they are engaged in a common cause. That is what Mr Keating has added to the APEC process since he initiated this new series of leaders meetings in Seattle in 1993. That really will be where the real value, I think, is perceived in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The short point I am making though, in answer to Senator Coulter's question, is that there is going to be a phenomenal increase in demand for agricultural products from around the region. Somebody has to supply that demand, if it is to be met. We are very confident of our capacity to do so, and we want to be very much a part of that action. What will happen as a result of the reduction of trade barriers is that the some of the constraints to the more economically sensible sources of supply will be removed. That is the basis on which the Australian farmers are so confident about these outcomes.</PARA>

The present minister's reply has indicated that no environmental considerations have been given. Is the government totally ignoring the advice of the world's leading scientists on greenhouse, which indicates that increasing trade in bulk goods is inconsistent with an effective attack on rising CO(2) levels caused by the burning of fossil fuel? Has the government any concern that the climate change that these same scientists now say has already begun may lead to much lower agricultural production in Australia and may mean, like the last few years of drought, that average production in Australia may not even be achieved?</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask: is it not a fact that the budget's stated objective of a budget surplus this year of about $700 million is now likely to turn out to be a deficit which could be as high as $1 billion or more? What actions does the government propose to take following this further run-down by it of Australia's national savings to counter the inevitable additional blow-out of Australia's huge balance of payments deficit and the upward pressure on interest rates that will result?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why this government brought down a budget which was in surplus this year was to put downward pressure on interest rates in Australia. Every person who borrows money for home loans wants to see downward pressure on interest rates. One of the ways of doing that is to lift public savings. Lifting public savings means having a budget which is in surplus. That is what we brought down in May of this year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston this day, relating to an industrial dispute in Weipa, Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the tragedy of it is that when we have a peripatetic foreign minister who only occasionally visits Australia, he really loses touch with what is going on out there, particularly the issues that are of concern to ordinary Australians and, indeed, ordinary workers. It must be a long time since he had to deal with the trade union movement,  particularly with Mr Kelty. If he did, he would understand what has been happening in recent days. It is perfectly clear that what is going on is a power struggle. The trade union movement is not interested in the welfare of the workers; it is interested in the welfare of the trade union bosses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly their interest is to maintain as many people on the drip feed as possible and to negotiate on their behalf&mdash;in other words, you treat them like cretins, you take their membership subscriptions and you make sure you decide what is in their best interests rather than consider what is happening on the ground at Weipa. If this wandering minstrel did take a good look at what was happening in Weipa, he would know that overwhelmingly the workers there are very satisfied with the staff salary arrangements which have been negotiated and that there is only a very small number who are holding out&mdash;presumably the dyed-in-the-wool unionists who are not particularly interested in negotiating higher levels of productivity and do not know what is in their best interests. Ninety per cent of them on the ground do. They are the ones who have been getting up to a $20,000 wage differential as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question about equal pay for equal work of equal value. These people are getting more money because they are contributing more and are adding more to the value of the company. They are the ones who deserve to be paid on that basis. It is know as performance pay in common parlance. The tragedy of the situation is that you have lost sight of what workers are really interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the spectacle of the trade union movement desperately trying to stop workers from getting more than the award. They want to drag everyone else down to the award level. They do not want to get out there and persuade the workers why they should actually be more constructive, why they should not work in close cooperation and why these staff arrangements that have been so successful over the last five years in a variety of workplaces around the country should not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a quiet revolution that has been going on and yet clearly Bill Kelty has been asleep on his own watch. He has only just woken up to the fact that the trade union movement is seeing the ground move from beneath it and that the interests of the workers are not synonymous with the interests of the trade union movement. Indeed, the workers know that the old them and us dichotomy is not in anyone's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you go to Hamersley or the New Zealand site you will find time again the workers, some of whom still belong to trade unions I might add, saying that they have never had it better and they would never think of going back to the old regime. They are not interested in the mindless industrial conflict and confrontation that is now being promoted by Mr Kelty as a desperate last resort to cover the fact that the union movement is very unhappy with his intervention on behalf of Lindsay Fox and others in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kelty has lost sight of the main game. He is no longer interested in the welfare of the workers. That is why I thought it was quite extraordinary that Senator Evans had the gall to quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> editorial. Presumably his minders thought that no-one else in the chamber reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> or, if they do, they would not have the ability to quote from the editorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go to the very heart of what it was that Senator Evans thought assisted his case. He said that CRA was not acting in the spirit of the legislation because, as the editorial says, it may turn out to be a mistake that many employees appear to have decided that membership of the union no longer makes sense. Then it went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was Senator Gareth Evans who said last week, when he was decrying the contract system up at Weipa or anywhere else, that once you are in a contract, there is no going back.

With this round robin of ministers in here, you do not quite know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that it is a total lie. Everyone should know by now that you only need to be on a contract at Weipa for a month. If you do not like the contract after that time, you are quite entitled to go back to collective bargaining. In fact, there have been one or two who have done that in the past few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cry in this strike is equal pay for equal work. No-one decries that. But with a contract system, there is another ingredient to the formula that no-one over there has mentioned: equal responsibility. It is a question of equal pay for equal work and equal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government senators can look quizzical, but they have to work out what those responsibilities are. When you look at equal pay for equal work, you have to work out whether the hours are the same. In the contract, they are not. They are knocking off when they have finished the job. If a job is not finished by a certain time and the company wants it finished, under the contract system you finish it. Then there is the question of whether there is strike or no strike&mdash;whether there is a contract or no contract, with those responsibilities. Also, the contracts are enforceable at law, both on the company and on the employee. As you see, the responsibilities of those under contract are far greater than under the collective system. Mind you, as I have already said, if you are on a contract, after only 30 days you can go back to collective bargaining, but there are not too many who go back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do companies have contracts like this? It is not to squash the unions. The unions have lost the faith of workers right around Australia. I doubt whether anybody on the government side has ever been in business and have had to employ people from their own pocket instead of from the government pocket. Anyone who has been in business will understand that a company wants to know that if they sign a contract with an overseas company they are going to be able to deliver, and not wonder whether or not their work force is working. With a contract system, they know whether they are going to be available to work and fill that contract. That is the basis of this argument and this government has failed badly on all points. </PARA>

That really denies the fact that over many, many years it has been union members and their funds that have won all the basic entitlements that all working Australians enjoy today. You can run the counter argument and say that every pay increase that union members achieve when they go to the arbitration commission and to courts should only go to workers who are members of unions. I am sure you would argue vehemently that that was discrimination. You would say that unions are seeking to line the pockets of their members. But that is not so in this case&mdash;you say it is okay for some workers who do exactly the same work, on the basis that they have agreed to a certain set of company conditions, to get paid significantly more than their colleagues who have chosen to want to bargain collectively for wage increases and other conditions.

From my own experience when I was secretary of the timber workers union, I have seen the documentation that North Broken Hill Peko presented to workers, saying they would get significant pay increases if they became non-union members, if they would sign individual contracts.

If you don't want the job under that contract, there is somebody else waiting for the job who will take the contract and we will employ those people who will take the contract, not those who wish to either become union members or who are union members and want to bargain collectively.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston talked about mindless confrontation. In my years as a trade union official I experienced lots of confrontation. It was not always on one side; it was on both sides. None of it was mindless. It may have been bloody-minded, unflinching and maybe sad in many cases, but not mindless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us focus on the history of Weipa for a moment. One can imagine companies seeking a different form of industrial relations and a different relationship with their employees if they are at all times involved in industrial disputation matters that are difficult for them to handle in terms of management. If you look at Weipa, over many years industrial awards were negotiated and upgraded without any confrontation and without any dispute at all. It was really a backwater and a very quiet place for industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, the confrontation occurred because the company decided, as it had in other places, that it wanted to move towards the elimination of trade unions at the workplace. It therefore offered the idea of individual contracts. It confronted the unions; the confrontation did not occur the other way. Certainly, the unions never set out to eliminate the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at that and compare it with other companies throughout this country where negotiated agreements on a collective basis have been carried through, you will find that they have been found to be very satisfactory. Indeed, in the negotiations of those agreements many suggestions have been made from the union side as to how to better manage and how to get a better bottom line result for the company and for themselves. They realise that one must work to create wealth before wages and salaries can be paid and before money can be set aside for more modern machinery and to expand the company. They realise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question of working together fairly cooperatively to create the biggest cake possible. There is always the question of how much of the cake each person gets. Regardless of the situation of how cooperative people may be&mdash;let us make no mistake that the company has said publicly that it is competing for leadership of the work force against the trade unions&mdash;there is always a question of a conflict of interest when it comes to the bottom line. Once the profit is made, there is always the consideration by the company as to how much it believes it should keep for the process that I described before of development of the company, new equipment and new management processes. There is the question of how much the workers get by way of a wage package. That conflict is there and it will always be there. In many cases there may not be a great conflict. There may be a small gap between the two parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every company that has ever been set up&mdash;either a small one or a large one&mdash;looks at the bottom line and seeks to get the highest possible profit within reason and in conformity with maintaining the company in a prosperous state for some years to come for the benefit either for a single owner or for the shareholders. In turn, the employees want to get a decent wage to provide for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing evil on either side, but the conflict is always there. Any fool who suggests that it is all right and moral to have no unions and that workers at the work face should not have an organisation to represent them had better go back to the drawing board and read a little bit of history to try to get some experience or talk to people who have had experience. If they did they would realise that that conflict will always be there and that there needs to be a representative of labour and a representative of capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza talked about going back to the old system of collective bargaining. I have talked to people who have been up there recently and they have told me that people are either ashamed of having signed the contracts individually or afraid they will be removed from the site if they are seen talking to militant trade union leaders. There is no doubt that they are afraid and that that pressure is coming from the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years when I negotiated awards I felt maybe it would be reasonable for only members of unions who were parties to those awards to get any increase in pay or paid according to the award. But companies, without any exception, said that any award payment that went to trade unionists had to go to non-unionists. Now we have CRA turning that right on its head and saying it is all right to give increases to non-unionists but the unions cannot have them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to the environmental impact of trade agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>One is very disturbed to find that, increasingly, this government is taking the country down a number of blind alleys. One of those blind alleys is assuming that the future lies with increased trade, particularly increased trade in bulk exports from Australia. Specifically in the area of agricultural production, the assumption that lies behind the recently signed APEC agreement is that, firstly, we can produce the food&mdash;the $2.9 billion of additional food that Senator Collins talked about today&mdash;without further environmental deterioration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think everybody in this chamber would know that we have in this country increasing salinisation, increasing loss of topsoil, pollution of our water supplies, exhaustion of our water supplies, loss of nutrient, loss of soil structure and loss of species. In every respect, agricultural production in this country is not yet on a sustainable basis, yet the government assumes, evidently, that we can meet demand for increased food production. Quite clearly they have recognised that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2020, Asia will be in need of a great deal more food consequent upon its population increase. So the question arises: can we produce the food? Will we be able to produce the food? Certainly by the year 2020 we will already have serious climate change. That has come out of the recent deliberations of the 200-odd scientists who are advising the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in relation to the greenhouse issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By then we will have climate change, although the government chooses to ignore this. We may well be in severe drought. For that reason, we may not be able to produce the food. But all this is being ignored by the government by going into these negotiations with its eye on simply the narrow economics of trade and not looking at what respected scientists from around the world are saying about the environmental consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, having produced the food that Asia will undoubtedly need, we need to be able to transport that food to those countries. When one looks at transport as it is currently organised, as it is fossil fuel powered, one comes to the conclusion that the transport in a greenhouse world will not be available. We have to change very drastically the technology we use in that transport or we will not be able to transport that food without serious and further greenhouse consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be assured that well before the year 2010 or the year 2020 governments, unlike the governments of today, will be addressing the greenhouse problem because there will already be serious consequences evident. The world will be taking a different perspective. Yet we go down this blind alley of assuming the future will be like the past only writ larger. We will produce more; we will have more environmental impacts. Somehow we can sustain that. We will use more fossil fuel, but somehow we will address the greenhouse problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no evidence at present that the government is taking these problems seriously. The government should be starting its economic analysis, by not looking purely at economics but looking at the real world that scientists are describing in which there is serious, continuing and accelerating environmental deterioration. This is the beginning of a sane and sensible analysis of trade policy. This the government, together with other governments, is simply not doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are enormous opportunities for Australia if only we were to recognise that the future will be different from the past. There are opportunities in alternative energy areas, some of which I have outlined in previous speeches. There are opportunities in terms of sharing that technology not in a competitive way but rather in a cooperative way. These are the things that we should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very depressing today to hear Senator Gareth Evans make light of the very serious question which I asked. He suggested that we should all go away and say `om' to ourselves. That was not a serious answer to a very serious question. It is depressing that on such a serious matter the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) chose to answer in that way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that occasion the government's response was very much similar to today's. There was an assumption that there were so many benefits absolutely assured, from our jumping with two feet, and I believe quite naively, into the way we negotiated the Uruguay Round of GATT, that there was absolutely no reason to put any of this in jeopardy by checking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony is that they did not check on the Uruguay Round of GATT. What is more, they did not even check on the economic benefits, so much so that more than a year down the track since it was negotiated and signed we are over a billion dollars a month on average down the tube even in terms of our trade. The economic benefits that were so confidently predicted were $5 billion once we got past five years; $5 billion benefits. </PARA>

If one partner in a relationship becomes unemployed, the family must now suffer loss of household income and pay FULL Childcare fees. This situation will occur because with one full time income in a household, social security benefits are not applicable to the unemployed person (and therefore not fee relief either). This will greatly inhibit the finding of new employment as without childcare, interviews, retraining or acceptance of temporary positions is not possible. The changes make provision for full time workers/students but many parents are in part-time work and/or part-time study. People will have to choose between these activities and do one or the other full time. Full time work leaves little time to study and full time study reduces the household income too far. The 12 hour limit leaves single parent families and those who have disabilities with only one day per week. This is not sufficient social interaction for most children. It also ignores parents who may have other ill children (requiring their parents full time care) in the home.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOSPITAL WASTES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government investigate the need for legislation relating to the transport of hospital wastes across borders and implement an appropriate strategy to reduce the risks associated with the transport and treatment of hospital wastes (Paragraph 3.105).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the existing or planned initiatives for reducing the risks associated with the transport of hospital wastes, additional legislation is unlikely to be required. Four separate but related national initiatives exist to reduce the risks associated with the transport, storage and treatment of hospital wastes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`National Guidelines for the Management of Clinical and Related Wastes', which provide the overarching framework for the management of hospital wastes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Australian Code for the Transport' of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail', which provides a national approach to the transport of hospital wastes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`National Guidelines for the Management of Wastes: National Manifest and Classification System', which provides a tracking system for hospital wastes; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A national standard is being developed which is expected to cover the storage and handling of some hospital wastes classified as Class 6.2 Dangerous Goods (Infectious Substances).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is revising the `National Guidelines for the Management of Clinical and Related Wastes'. This revision is taking account of new technologies for waste treatment, rising community concerns about the risks associated with the transport and disposal of hospital wastes, and recent Government initiatives with respect to waste issues.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Guidelines, which were published in 1988 by the NHMRC, is to recommend procedures for the safe packaging, labelling, storage, transport and disposal of such wastes. They are intended to assist authorities and practitioners in determining the appropriate waste management strategy. The Guidelines provide a basis for the development of any current and future strategy for the management of clinical and related wastes in Australia, particularly for hospitals and other similar health care organisations.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Guidelines have been well received. Most hospitals have made use of the Guidelines in developing their own waste policy and procedures. The Guidelines recommend coding standards for the three most hazardous categories of clinical wastes (i.e. infectious, cytotoxic and radioactive wastes). These standards are now well adopted throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the transport of hospital wastes, the Guidelines also recommended that in adhering to local transport regulations, reference should also be made to the `Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail'.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before additional legislation could be considered, however, States and Territories should be consulted to ascertain whether they have experienced problems in enforcing the relevant requirements of the Australian Code which is generally endorsed by all States and Territories. They should also be consulted in order to determine whether they are satisfied with the Code in regard to the transport of hospital wastes. If any State finds that the Australian Code does not adequately address the issue of hospital wastes, mechanisms exist for the State to initiate revision of the Code.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third initiative affecting the transport of hospital wastes across State and Territory borders is the `National Guidelines for the Management of Wastes: National Manifest and Classification System'. These Guidelines have been prepared by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and provide a system for tracking certain, usually hazardous, wastes across State borders. Amongst the wastes subject to this system are clinical and pharmaceutical wastes which are made up of the following categories: infectious substances, pathogenic substances, pharmaceuticals and residues, cytotoxic substances, and wastes from the production and preparation of pharmaceutical products.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system requires that the local authority in the receiving State or Territory is notified of a proposed movement of waste, and that the waste is manifested with a waste transport certificate throughout its movement.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The system is already operative in Victoria and South Australia and is being introduced in Queensland and New South Wales. The Guidelines are also going through the process of ANZECC endorsement.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) is developing a national standard for the storage and handling of dangerous goods. Currently some hospital waste is classified as Class 6.2 Dangerous Goods (Infectious Substances). It is anticipated that the storage and handling of these goods will be covered by the finalised standard.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will, however, be important to ensure that these initiatives are complementary, avoid duplication and are implemented in a co-ordinated manner. This could be assisted by increased consultation with the relevant authorities responsible for the management of hospital wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MUNICIPAL INCINERATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that approvals for the construction of incinerators should include recycling and waste to energy facilities (Paragraph 3.107).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth considers that incineration with waste-to-energy facilities is a potentially feasible option for waste management but it would need to be justified on environmental, social and economic grounds. While incineration of domestic waste is currently not widely used in Australia, the construction and operation of any incineration facility should be within strict environmental and health guidelines and include a waste-to-energy capacity. Responsibility for the determination of these guidelines is presently shared between Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, and the establishment of the National Environment Protection Council (NEPC) will promote a national approach to the setting of environment protection measures in relevant areas of waste management.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsibility for the granting of approvals for the construction of incinerators typically lies with the State and Territory Governments rather than the Commonwealth Government. As such it would be most appropriate for State and Territory Governments to determine what conditions are attached to any approvals for particular incinerators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HIGH TEMPERATURE INCINERATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that technologies designed to reuse or recycle be given priority, and environmentally friendlier alternative technologies for the destruction of scheduled waste be considered in preference to high temperature incineration (Paragraph 5.37).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is consistent with the position taken by ANZECC and is supported.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 10 July 1992 ANZECC considered the draft report of the Independent Panel on Intractable Waste, which had been established to investigate the extent and production of scheduled waste and alternative disposal technologies, and decided to abandon the proposal to establish a centralised high temperature waste disposal facility.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision reflected a conceptual shift away from one of managing all of Australia's scheduled waste as a single waste. stream and disposing of it through the establishment of a centralised disposal facility, to one of acknowledging the separate components of the scheduled waste stream and placing reliance on a range of emerging technologies for treating the different parts of the scheduled waste stream.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of management plans for the treatment of scheduled wastes has been initiated. The process will include a consideration of all issues, including technical, health, environmental, economic and social aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULED WASTE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that enterprises be required to disclose the quantities of scheduled wastes they have stored and that these be stored in National Environment Protection Council approved premises, and that an agreement for their disposal or a research proposal for their reuse or recycling be made with National Environment Protection Council by the year 2001 (Paragraph 5.138).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under mirror legislation, the NEPC has two functions: to make national environment protection measures (NEPMS) and to report on their implementation and effectiveness across Australia. The Council, which will be established in 1995, will be empowered to make NEPMs that relate to, amongst other issues, environmental impacts associated with hazardous wastes and the reuse and recycling of used materials.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council does not have control over implementation of measures as this is left to each jurisdiction. Both the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE) and the NEPC legislation make it clear that the implementation and enforcement of national measures are the responsibility of each jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993 ANZECC agreed to develop a national strategy to manage Australia's scheduled wastes. The aims of this strategy are to establish conditions for the safe management and disposal of scheduled wastes and to determine agreed dates by which the production and use of scheduled wastes are to cease.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANZECC has instituted a process of developing management plans for each class of scheduled waste. Over the next three years, management plans will be endorsed by ANZECC as they are produced. In developing these management plans, environmental performance criteria will be established. Facilities will have to meet these performance criteria in order to be licensed to treat such wastes. Each management plan will specify (inter alia) notifiable quantities of waste, the requirements for storage of waste, and a deadline for disposal of waste stockpiles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5 </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that enterprises be required to have scheduled waste disposed of according to the terms of an agreement with NEPC by an environmentally acceptable process at a rate which is commercially feasible (Paragraph 5.139).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">NEPC has the power to pass national environment protection measures on environmental impacts associated with hazardous wastes and the reuse and recycling of used materials. In developing national environment protection measures, NEPC is required to take into account economic and commercial feasibility factors.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">NEPC however, does not have the power to enter into agreements on the disposal methods of scheduled wastes. ANZECC is addressing such issues in its development of management plans (see response to Recommendation 4).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A transfer of responsibility for co-ordination of the scheduled waste issue from ANZECC to NEPC does not appear to have any advantages and may itself delay appropriate action. Even if a transfer of responsibility did occur, under the NEPC scheme implementation is left to individual jurisdictions. Hence it would be for individual governments to implement and enforce agreements on disposal of scheduled wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CEMENT KILNS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 6</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government investigate the potential and feasibility of using cement kilns for the disposal of particular waste streams (Paragraph 6.37).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunities for disposing of particular waste streams should be examined on a case-by-case basis and would be best undertaken by State and Territory Governments, which are responsible for regulating both waste management activities and cement production facilities in their jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cement kilns is several States currently use a variety of materials as energy sources (e.g. used tyres). While it is recognised that such practices as energy reclamation are a preferable option to landfill disposal, recognition needs to be given to the potential hazards that could be created. Compliance with State and Territory environment protection relations is required. The future use of these and other materials will be dependent on, among other things, the economics of the practice and community concerns about using cement kilns for waste disposal purposes.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of the availability of technologies for the treatment of scheduled wastes is being conducted by the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) within the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. The Cement Industry Federation Limited has advised that the current cement kiln operators are not interested in burning scheduled waste materials in cement kilns in the foreseeable future, primarily because of the potential for adverse public reaction.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this basis, while from a technical viewpoint cement kilns may have the potential to destroy scheduled wastes, it appears unlikely for non-technical reasons that this will occur on a commercial scale in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government investigate the avenues available to regulate the use of materials for recycling in preference to their use as a supplementary fuel (Paragraph 6.39).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach adopted by the Government in the `National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Strategy' is a co-operative rather than a regulatory approach. On the basis of environmental, technological, social and economic considerations, recycling of materials may be preferable in some circumstances to the use of those materials as a supplementary fuel, although in other circumstances the reverse may also be true. Any decision to support waste-to-energy should be made on the basis of a case by case assessment. To a large extent, it will be market demand and technological advancements that will dictate the fate of recyclable materials.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the responsibility for waste management and recycling generally lies with State, Territory and local Governments, it would be more appropriate for these governments to investigate policy options for ensuring materials are recycled rather than used as-supplementary fuels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INDEPENDENT PANELS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that independent panels be established to facilitate the settlement of ongoing disputes with regard to waste management issues (Paragraph 7.43).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Independent panels have had some success in addressing community conflict in relation to complex waste issues. This is likely to continue to be an approach adopted by the Government where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 9</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the members of these panels be determined by the National Environment Protection Council and not have members from the State or Territory in which the dispute occurs (Paragraph 7.44).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is outside the mandate of the NEPC but is an appropriate issue for consideration by ANZECC. It should be noted that the co-operative framework within which the Government operates on waste issues necessitates involvement by all relevant States and Territories.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion to take note of the government response and I would like to make a few remarks about it. The government's response to this report has been awaited by some members of the community with great anticipation, and I am pleased to say that the response is, in general terms, positive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would rather not spend too much time considering the first recommendation in regard to hospital waste. However, I do note that the response stated that the interstate transport of hospital wastes, which had been undertaken in some instances to avoid local requirements, was being considered under a number of intergovernmental initiatives&mdash;not the least of which were the national guidelines for the management of clinical and related wastes as well as the Australian code for the transport of dangerous goods by road and rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than spend time on that recommendation, I would like to note some of the other responses to the committee's report. As a member of the committee, I was particularly keen to see that these recommendations were responded to. The second recommendation of the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that approvals for the construction of incinerators&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that meant waste disposal incinerators&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should include recycling and waste to energy facilities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Part of the government's response was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsibility for the granting of approvals for the construction of incinerators typically lies with the State and Territory Governments rather than the Commonwealth Government. As such it would be most appropriate for State and Territory Governments to determine what conditions . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that that is rather much a cop-out, because it would not be inappropriate for the federal government to undertake research into this sort of matter and make recommendations, and that was very much the theme of the initial report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee saw that the Commonwealth government had a role in establishing research and models for the most appropriate way of dealing with some of the problems. To read in the government's response that, as usual, the federal government would rather not adopt that role but leave it to the states to dream up their own ways of dealing with things really shows that this is a case of the federal government not undertaking the role which we have a right to expect them to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That criticism does not apply to all of the government responses, just to a couple that I will deal with in making these remarks. With regard to high temperature incineration, the third recommendation of the committee was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . technologies designed to reuse or recycle be given priority, and environmentally friendlier alternative technologies for the destruction of scheduled waste be considered in preference to high temperature incineration . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to read that the government's response in the first instance was to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is consistent with the position taken by ANZECC and is supported.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's response further noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision reflected a conceptual shift away from one of managing all of Australia's scheduled waste as a single waste stream and disposing of it through the establishment of a centralised disposal facility, to one of acknowledging the separate components of the scheduled waste stream and placing reliance on a range of emerging technologies for treating the different parts of the scheduled waste stream.</PARA>
<PARA>We are very pleased to note that response, because it is very much in accord with the sort of evidence that the committee received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind the Senate that on page 4 of the committee's report, which we tabled in September 1994, we noted at point 1.14 Professor Worner's very interesting evidence to the committee. Professor Worner is the scientific adviser for the Illawarra Technology Corporation Ltd. He brought to the committee the concept that there is no such thing as waste; it is just a resource that wants some innovative idea on how it can be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this refreshing attitude we move away from the idea that waste is a troublesome and somewhat inconvenient substance to the concept that waste is something which is a challenge to our capacity to innovate and derive some benefit from. By doing that we move right away from the idea that waste has to be burnt in a high temperature incinerator to the concept of waste being something for which we can explore alternative uses and, therefore, alternative benefits. This concept brings us to an entirely different approach to what is appropriate to place in landfills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Skipping recommendations Nos 4 and 5 and the associated responses, I look at recommendation 6, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Government investigate the potential and feasibility of using cement kilns for the disposal of particular waste streams&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The government response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunities for disposing of particular waste streams should be examined on a case-by-case basis and would be best undertaken by State and Territory Governments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Again that is somewhat of a cop-out. It is important to note that there is another reason for criticising that response, apart from the criticism that it is a cop-out. The government response continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future use of these and other materials will be dependent on, among other things, the economics of the practice and community concerns about using cement kilns for waste disposal purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as I am concerned, here is a direct opportunity for the Commonwealth government to help the community determine whether their concerns are properly based. That is what governments are for. The federal government can and should use its resources to conduct research, to lead the debate and to make sure the community is informed about the potential advantages and disadvantages of different ways of disposing of waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 7, where the committee recommended that the government investigate the avenues available to regulate the use of materials for recycling in preference to their use as a supplementary fuel, the government response was, essentially, that these opportunities should be examined on a case by case assessment and that, to a large extent, market demand will determine that. Here is a distinct role for national leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the waste management options are driven by threshold quantities. We all know that newspapers, used tyres, waste oil and construction materials are good examples of this tendency. We know there are several potential uses for tyres. To abandon the question of regulation and to rely solely on the market is an abrogation of government responsibility and is a strategy which could well lead to confusion and a set of practices which are contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be specific here, three used tyres are a nuisance. If they are in the backyard, most people would recognise them as a nuisance. Thirty used tyres are somewhat of a headache. But when you have 3,000 used tyres, they become a real problem to store, to transport, to reuse or to dispose of. But at that stage significant costs and significant potential benefits are likely. If we have three million tyres, that would be a significant resource and would enable the establishment of reprocessing facilities, infrastructure, marketing et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation can and should be used to encourage the aggregation of such a resource. If it is illegal to dump tyres, if it is illegal to burn them in the backyard or if it is illegal to dispose of them in certain other ways, then it becomes more likely that a significant resource can be aggregated. My point is that legislative leadership does have a role. It is just not good enough to avoid that role and leave that matter to the market, as this response has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in general terms, I am rather pleased that essentially the response&mdash;for example, in answer to the committee's recommendation 11 that where technology is available governments work with industry to encourage the use of recycled materials instead of raw materials&mdash;tells us that the government is doing that, as it does with recommendation 12, which is about a consultative process. In particular, we suggest in recommendation 13 some waste reduction targets, and the response tells us that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the National Waste Database, currently being developed, will provide information to waste managers and the community on waste generation and progress towards achieving a 50% reduction in the amount of waste going to landfill by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>Also, I am pleased to notice that, in a recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>, we have been advised that New South Wales is substantially increasing its fines for illegally dumped waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in general, the government is moving towards some of the recommendations which we made. Also, I am pleased to see that this issue has achieved a higher priority than it had before the committee reported. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE MAJORITY REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ABC MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government notes that the general conclusion of the Select Committee majority report is that the basic structure of the ABC is sound and the organisation is stronger and more relevant to the community than it was ten years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the majority report can draw this conclusion about the ABC's performance reflects in part this government's record and commitment to ensuring that the ABC is equipped to deliver its charter responsibilities and continues to provide services that are relevant to and valued by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government initiated triennial funding arrangements in 1988-89 which allow the ABC to plan for the future with a high degree of certainty. The triennial funding arrangements have maintained ABC funding in real terms since the exemption of the ABC from the efficiency dividend in 1991 and also allow the ABC to retain revenue generated from its commercial activities. This funding stability provided by the government indicates the importance the government attaches to the role of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1995-96 Budget, the ABC, together with other triennially funded agencies, was exempted from running costs reductions applying to all other Commonwealth departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of recent initiatives by the government have broadened the scope of ABC services. These include extension of ABC Fine Music, ABC Triple J, and the Second Regional Radio initiative which are providing additional ABC radio services to regional Australia. The government has provided $5.4 million to assist the ABC to establish the Australia Television  satellite service. The government has also allocated to the ABC a satellite Pay TV licence for two channels and has provided $12.5 million to assist ABC participation in Pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government notes that many of the majority report's recommendations impinge on areas which are properly the responsibility of the ABC.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ABC MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This letter is to inform you of the ABC's response to. the Report of the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board welcomed the major findings of the Report. The statements recognising the importance of the ABC in the lives of all Australians and the ABC's high reputation both within Australia and overseas were particularly pleasing. We agree with the Committee when it said that the basic structure of the ABC is sound and that the need for a quality independent national broadcaster is greater today than it was a decade ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's support for an independent national broadcaster, playing an essential part in this Australian democracy, is very much appreciated. The comments in relation to adequate funding were equally welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board has carefully considered the recommendations of the majority report and the comments in the minority report. Attached is the ABC's response to each recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will see that all recommendations relevant to ABC Editorial Policies have been referred to the Editorial Policies Working Group (with board and management representation). The Group is working to develop the next edition of the booklet. The booklet will undergo more substantial rewriting on this occasion than has been the case when a new edition is published. A discussion paper which included the relevant Committee recommendations has been distributed throughout the ABC, calling for staff input. The National Advisory Council and the Independent Complaints Review Panel were also asked to contribute. The comments and suggestions are currently being reviewed by the Working Group, after which drafting and further consultation will take place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, it is difficult to predict the final outcome of the drafting and consultative processes. However I can assure you that the full board (to whom the Working Group reports) is committed to developing a clear, comprehensive and consistent set of policies to guide ABC personnel in their working lives and to safeguard the independence of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same way that recommendations covering editorial matters have been referred to the editorial group, recommendations covering human resources have been referred to the Human Resources board of Management. These matters were the subject of initial discussions at the recent meeting of the Joint Consultative Committee (JCC). The JCC, established under section 81 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, includes representatives of the corporation and relevant unions. Discussions will continue at subsequent meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation in relation to Business News Australia (BNA) has been overtaken by events. You will no doubt be aware that the ABC has decided to end the BNA service when present contractual arrangements are concluded. In other instances, you will see that the thrust of the recommendations has already been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC will consider further the recommendations in relation to Australia Television and will discuss them with you in due course. You are aware that the board is currently reviewing aspects of the Australia Television service in light of the fact that it has not attracted sufficient sponsorship to achieve revenue targets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the subscription television recommendation, the board itself will consistently assess whether any, and if so what, effects on ABC editorial and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">program independence might arise once the two subscription channels have commenced operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the committee has treated a range of ABC activities which involve some element of marketing or revenue raising as being "commercial". This is a confusing description in that many of these activities exist in order to provide a service and any "commercial" component is incidental</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Board guidelines ensure that all revenue raising activity compiles with fair competition practices; full transparency and accountability, including a range of credible performance indicators; strict financial controls and audits; and meets the ABC's Charter objectives. The close integration of ABC activities without an over burdening bureaucratic structure has given life to the majority of ABC products and services. Introduction of an administratively more complex and costly structure would, in the ABC's view, provide little advantage or value and in reality would more likely reduce the viability, variety and range of products available, disadvantaging many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board welcomes the recognition that decentralisation may warrant an increase in funding to meet the costs involved. Within financial constraints, the board encourages efforts to keep a sensible spread of staff and resources across Australia. The ABC is pleased that the relevant industrial unions have offered to work cooperatively and constructively with us to this end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporate Plan is currently undergoing its annual review in preparation for commencement on 1 July next. It is anticipated that the new version win spell out more clearly the ABC's ongoing commitment to its staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The board has no comment to make in relation to the composition of and appointments to the board, except to confirm the ABC position advanced throughout the inquiry process that these are matters for the Governor General acting on the advice of government. The board does not intend to take up the recommendation to establish a separate, full-time secretariat.</PARA>

The close integration of ABC activities without an over burdening bureaucratic structure has given life to the majority of ABC products and services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>In February 1994 the Review of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements said that there were allegations about the existence of networks of paedophiles operating in Australia and that the extent of the networks and their activities remained unknown. The report recommended that organised paedophile networks should be added to the areas of major organised crime that the National Crime Authority was expected to focus on, and the government accepted this recommendation. In December 1994 the committee agreed to conduct an inquiry into the extent to which organised paedophile networks had become established in Australia, and related matters such as the adequacy of police resources and the role of the National Crime Authority in tackling this area of criminal activity. To some extent the conclusions reached on the scope of organised paedophile activity depend on the breadth or narrowness of definitions adopted for such key terms as `paedophile', `child pornography' and `organised networks'. Yet obviously those terms are used with widely varying definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information presented to the committee was that most sexual offences against children are committed by their relatives and neighbours who are not paedophiles in the strict sense of the term and who do not operate in any organised or network way. To the extent that two or more paedophiles group together to commit offences, the numbers involved have almost invariably been very small and the groupings very much ad hoc and on a peer-to-peer basis. More commonly, where there are contacts between paedophile offenders, they consist of loose, informal networks of peer-to-peer contacts. The committee did not receive any evidence that organised paedophile groups and networks have ever resembled in size, aims, structures, methods or longevity the organised crime groups which provide the main focus for the National Crime Authority's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the committee did not receive evidence of any commercial production of illegal child pornography in Australia. Most of the current illegal material that undoubtedly is possessed by many paedophiles appears to be made by them, obtained by informal trading of homemade material among paedophiles assisted by informal networking, or obtained from overseas. There is no evidence of organised promotion or arrangement of tours by Australian paedophiles to overseas destinations known to be attractive to them. However, informal networking among paedophiles may assist some tourists going overseas to commit paedophile offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the evidence on the nature and extent of organised paedophile activity, the committee found it necessary to make only limited recommendations for change. The committee considered it essential that any focus by law enforcement agencies on organised paedophilia is not at the expense of resources devoted to the majority of cases of child sexual abuse. While clearly paedophile networking should not be ignored, an over-emphasis on it risks distracting community attention from the majority of child sex offenders&mdash;the lone offenders who are all too frequently members of the same family or household as their victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee noted that the National Crime Authority is to complete its own strategic intelligence assessment of organised paedophile activity early in 1996. Mr Sherman, the authority chairperson, told the committee in August that if the authority assessment matched the committee's he did not propose that the National Crime Authority stay around in that area creating a role for itself. The committee endorsed this view. The specialist units in state and territory police forces have the experience, facilities and expertise in investigating child sexual assault that the National Crime Authority does not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In coming to this view, the committee recognised that  there was scope for improvement in the way that the various police forces work together to detect paedophile offenders. Police told the committee that cooperation amongst their forces was generally good, but they agreed that there could be improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where the committee considered that improvements could be made is in the detection of child pornography which has been imported electronically via computer links. At present, no particular agency appears to have responsibility for the surveillance of the computer transmission of pornographic material. The committee believes the Commonwealth government should accept responsibility for the detection of offences involving the transmission of child pornography using the telephone network. This responsibility ought to be resolved by direct arrangements between the specialist state and territory units and whichever Commonwealth agency is considered to be most suitable for the job. The committee considered, however, that the National Crime Authority was not the suitable agency in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the committee believes that there are obvious benefits in Australian law enforcement agencies working cooperatively to equip themselves with the necessary computer training, expertise and access to specialised software and hardware tools needed to keep them abreast of the actual and potential use of computers for criminal paedophile purposes. We have made recommendations to this effect. The committee also recommended that the Minister for Justice explore the possibility of establishing a single, well publicised e-mail address accessible through the Internet to which computer users can report any indications they come across of computer distribution of child pornography&mdash;in effect, an e-mail hotline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area in which the committee recommended changes concerned the activity of Australian paedophiles in South-East Asia. The committee recommended that the government take steps to improve the arrangements between the Thai, Cambodian and other South-East Asian authorities to assist in the detection and obtaining of evidence to enable the prosecution of Australians committing child sex offences in those countries. The committee also made recommendations designed to improve the flow of information to the Australian Federal Police about the illegal activities of Australian paedophiles overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some non-government organisations argued that improved record keeping on suspected and convicted child sex offenders was needed to assist them to vet their staff and persons working through them. It was said that police records do not always contain the names of persons notified as abusers to child welfare agencies, and better integration of agencies records was required. It seemed to the committee that what was sought ideally was a national register of known and suspected child sex offenders. The committee made no recommendation on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has identified in its report its concerns with the scope of the proposals put to it. In particular, the committee did not favour the view that the register should include the names of alleged offenders who had not been convicted. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment briefly on the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Organised Criminal  Paedophile Activity</EMPHASIS>. The committee found that there is very little, if any, organised paedophile criminal activity as we understand that term, not that that is any consolation. It does mean that such activity is more widely dispersed, is more prevalent than we suspected and is more difficult to investigate, identify and prosecute. It is no consolation that many Australian paedophiles travel overseas to indulge in these crimes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we have relevant legislation to prosecute those people, it is proving extremely difficult to do this and does depend to a large extent on the effective cooperation of the police forces in the countries the paedophiles travel to to commit these crimes. When they return, it does mean that Australian children are more at risk. It is difficult to apprehend offenders when they are not organised and therefore not easily identifiable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found that most sexual offences against children are committed by their relatives and neighbours who are not paedophiles in the strict sense of the term and who do not operate in an organised or networked way. To cope with this particular situation the committee made a number of recommendations which, to a large extent, are related to resources and to the organisation of these resources by our law enforcement agencies. These recommendations relate to training, access to specialist expertise and, obviously, access to criminal intelligence databases such as the one operated by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee suggested further that there should be formal agreements between relevant law enforcement agencies relating to information sharing which could be used in this particular case. It has asked the Minister for Justice to raise these matters with the Australasian Police Ministers Council to examine to what extent action is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that the Minister for Justice take steps to ensure that Australian law enforcement agencies contribute to and draw on the expertise and software tools of overseas law enforcement agencies. That brings me back to the point that I raised before that we need to step up the cooperation and arrangements that exist between Australian and overseas police forces. In that context, the Thai police force and law enforcement agencies in Cambodia were mentioned. The committee also recommended that the government take steps to ensure that all personnel working overseas in countries believed to be attractive to visiting Australian paedophiles are made aware that any information they happen to come across about the illegal activities of such paedophiles should be reported to the Australian Federal Police for further investigation and prosecution in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This report arose essentially from several crises around the world, particularly the failure of the Barings Brothers bank out of the action by Nick Leeson in the Singapore exchange a little over a year ago. There were also other major crashes at about the same time. I guess the other most famous one was Orange County in the US, where there were losses of $US1.76 billion. They were to do with futures on interest rates. The Baring Brothers one was futures on stocks and bonds. There were quite a few others in the last few years that achieved notoriety around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee commenced an inquiry into this matter with relevance for Australia in November last year. We found on the evidence that what happened in Singapore was, in fact, a management problem in that the dealer was acting also as the backroom accountant and was not being supervised by management. So the fundamental lesson to be learnt from the Baring Brothers failure is that dealers dealing in derivatives need to be separate from the accountant who is doing the settlement&mdash;handling the money, in other words. They need to be separate and, beyond that, management overseeing these two groups needs to understand what is going on. That did not happen in the Leeson-Baring Brothers incident in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took evidence from the Australian entities that organise transactions in derivatives, specifically the Sydney Futures Exchange, the Australian Stock Exchange and also the Australian Securities Commission. The evidence was that the chance of this non-separation happening in Australia was, in fact, virtually impossible. There is close supervision by the exchanges of the processing of derivative products, a clear separation of dealing from accounting, and a clear recognition by management of overseeing these matters. Each of the exchanges goes to a lot of trouble to make sure that they understand the positions that have been taken by firms and by individuals, which was something that did not take place, for instance, in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important thing to note is that there is now, following that Baring Brothers failure&mdash;and part of that was due to a lack of understanding between rival exchanges as to contracts taken out in two rival exchanges&mdash;a worldwide move to try to coordinate an understanding of the positions taken by players in the derivatives market. The committee welcomes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our main conclusions are that for Australia there is no need for additional legislation over this area. We believe the market is working well, but an eye needs to be kept on it. We recommend, in fact, to the Australian Securities Commission that in the annual report they should give a synopsis of the derivatives market as it operates here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe there should be any restriction on raising new products. There are new products in the derivatives market being thought about and put on the market on a reasonably regular basis. We do not believe there should be any legislative controls on that process, but when they are incorporated, there needs to be the key principles of separation of dealers from the people who pay the money, the accountants, with management overseeing the lot. Our committee found that we in Australia are fortunate; we do have a good system. As I said, the only thing that is missing and which our exchanges are looking at, and are actively involved in, is the matter of international cooperation on positions taken by traders in this business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final main recommendation is that there should be more effort made by the people involved in the industry to make sure people around the periphery and others, the general public, have a better understanding of what derivatives are and when they are used. They are, in fact, a risk reduction means for people in the financial markets. They are a means of reducing risk, particularly for major players in the industry, and they do add value. They are a genuine addition to the markets and a good thing for the market. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In the time available to me to deal with this important report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Thailand</EMPHASIS>, I would like to deal with two points before making some general comments on the Australia-Thailand relationship. The first specific point relates to an earlier report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and a recommendation in its report on human rights. The second point relates to other recent reports of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1993, we tabled a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Indonesia</EMPHASIS>. One of its recommendations dealt with the inclusion of an assessment of progress towards the establishment and protection of human rights in that country by Australia's development assistance agency. The government's response to that report seems to imply that the committee was in some way recommending a change to the policy by which the development assistance program is not linked to human rights performance. The committee was in fact aware of that policy and was not recommending a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to the report also made the point that virtually all development assistance, such as women in development or poverty alleviation projects, has human rights implications. The report I have just tabled on relations with Thailand includes a recommendation that the development assistance agency target projects which are directed towards improving human rights in that country. In making this recommendation, the committee is not asking the Australian government to change its policy and link development assistance with progress towards human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paragraph immediately before the recommendation explicitly says that this is not the case. It points out that the specific human rights emphasis in the development assistance program in Thailand is not definable. This country is prepared to spend $44.9 million on development assistance in Thailand. It also emphasises the universality of human rights. It is surely not unreasonable, therefore, to expect some focus on programs which, following consultation with the Thai authorities, have an emphasis on human rights. We would hope that those who prepare the government response are aware not only of this recommendation but also of what seems to be a gap in our assistance program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would like to make relates to another report tabled recently by the joint standing committee. It was very noticeable, although the section of the report which dealt with prostitution was only three pages out of 110, this was the only section which received media attention. The report's title was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human rights and progress towards democracy in Burma</EMPHASIS>, and that faithfully reflects its emphasis. It would be a pity if the same thing happened to the report on relationships with Thailand. Although trafficking in women for the purposes of prostitution is an important issue, it is only a small part of our report, which deals with the bilateral relationship between Australia and Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A look at the table of contents makes it clear that this report deals with the bilateral relationship in detail. To do this, for example, it describes the Thai economy and sets out the trading relationship between the two nations. Part 3 deals with a number of important Australian connections and opportunities, including defence, legal and educational relationships. It looks at Thailand's relations with its neighbours and piracy in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Viewed as a whole, this report seeks to improve a relationship which was described as `longstanding, close and cordial'. It was also put to us that just after the Second World War this relationship was at its peak and has not achieved those heights since. While there is nothing wrong with the bilateral relationship, it lacks something. Thailand is a very important nation in South-East Asia and it would be very easy to make a selfish, national interest case in favour of a close relationship. Another reason could be that the two nations get on well at a personal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made a number of recommendations which it hopes will be effective in broadening and deepening the relationship. While many reasons could be advanced to achieve this end, this is the one which has guided the committee in its deliberations. It believes that Australia has a range of skills and expertise in a number of areas which may be of use to Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In framing these recommendations, we were conscious that many require consultation with Thai authorities before they can be adopted and that they will make the decisions about our offers of assistance. This is how it should be. We would also hope that the Australian government will look at these recommendations positively and look for ways to incorporate ideas from this report into the existing policy framework. Parliamentary committees often feel that government responses to reports are unjustly dismissive of their efforts. I very much hope that this will not be the case with this report. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address what I think is the logical consequence of proceeding down that path and, presumably, then voting against amendment 14.

So you would have the ultimate bad result where there would not be even that level of protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we are opposed to the three amendments&mdash;in other words, the combination of what we have always said is bandaid surgery suddenly bringing in an arbitrary level of 15 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That takes me back to my original proposition&mdash;that, really, you should not try to patch up these things on the run; you should have a full and proper review of the whole concept underlying the cross-media rules to work out the most effective way of doing it. If you do it in bits, you could well end up with the ultimate unintentional outcome. Where you think you are ameliorating a situation, you might worsen it in terms of an injustice to someone with a holding in excess of 15 per cent. In other words, if we were to carry amendments 4 and 11, which I am opposed to, but we were to successfully oppose 14, a party with 17.2 per cent would immediately be in breach of the law with no protection of the grandfather arrangement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of whether the committee should allow that course to be followed, I think it is important for Senator Margetts to indicate what path she intends to follow and whether she would argue that that result will follow. It seems to me that, if the end result were to be that 4 and 11 are carried and 14 is not, this will be the ultimate example of retrospective legislation. The legislation will say to someone who has within the law gone to 17.2 per cent and been cleared by the ABA that, sitting where you are now, you are in breach even though you were not when you increased to that level. In other words, you did what you were allowed to do by law, the ABA cleared you and suddenly you are being told that that is illegal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole purpose of grandfathering is to say that if you did something that was legal at the time you should not be forced to divest yourself subsequently by a change in the law. In other words, it is prospective; you allow someone to be grandfathered and they sit on the 17.2 per cent. But the minute they make any change to their arrangements they forfeit the protection of the grandfathering. Grandfathering is a deliberate mechanism that guards against someone suddenly being forced to sell down because their actions are deemed, retrospectively, to be illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arises in a much starker fashion in relation to CanWest and their holdings in Channel 7 and Channel 10. As we know, their voting rights are 14.9 per cent. Because of the non-voting rights attaching to debentures and the loans they have made, they have a 57 per cent economic interest in the company. If the view is taken that this device should not be allowed in future, that is one thing. It is another thing altogether to say to CanWest, `We don't care that what you did was legal at the time and you have been in that situation for some years, we are suddenly going to make you sell down tomorrow from 57 per cent to 14.9 per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one has argued that. The government has not yet come up with the legislation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. That is a very good reason for opposing that provision, because it is not effective. You should still at least support the principle of grandfathering, which is that you would not suddenly turn around and say to CanWest, `Now this law has gone through, it is retrospective. You have been entitled to a holding of 57 per cent for some years, but suddenly you are illegal and you have to go down to 15 per cent overnight because there is no grandfathering.' I would have thought that was a very unfair outcome. That is why, even though it creates complications, grandfathering is put in as a matter of course to guard against retrospective application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you knocked off amendment 14, there would be no grandfathering protection. The holder of a 17.2 per cent interest legally acquired would be immediately required to divest itself and go down below the 15 per cent. That seems to me not to be the outcome that anyone is arguing for; certainly not the government and certainly not the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You may have a different view on the appropriateness of a 15 per cent limit, but that is not the same thing as saying, at the same time, you will rip up the protection that is put in place by grandfathering.

Under the new arrangements the funding arrangements to the Catholic Education Office . . . the Canberra Institute of Technology . . . will remain unchanged, however the funding to the ACT Department of Education and Training . . . will face a possible cut of 20%.

<PARA>They put the point to me that the ACT started from a much lower base. More specifically, the letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst I understand that all States and Territories are facing similar cuts, in the case of the ACT this could mean a possible $60,000 cut out of a $320,000 budget. Due to the fact that the ACT is a small player in comparison to other States and Territories it does not have an initial budget of such a size that a 20% cut can be catered for within the overall budget for AESIP initiatives.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Highlighted amongst the debate is the proposed "per capita funding" arrangements which the government is saying will allow the allocated funding to be rationalised to the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The debates which have so far been printed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> contain speeches by members of both the major parties, none of whom represent from the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the ACT Aboriginal Education Consultative Group (AECG) representative I wish to bring to your attention how these "per capita funding" arrangements will affect the ACT. Under the new arrangements the funding arrangements to the Catholic Education Office (CEO), the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) will remain unchanged, however the funding to the ACT Department of Education and Training (DET) will face a possible cut of 20%. In effect the "per capita arrangements" are telling Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that if their children are enrolled in a public school the Commonwealth Government will place a less value on the need for quality education than if they attended a non-government school. Their peers who are attending a non-government school will have more resources placed in the hands of their educational managers than government sector education managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst I understand that all States and Territories are facing similar cuts, in the case of the ACT this could mean a possible $60,000 cut out of a $320,000 budget. Due to the fact that the ACT is a small player in comparison to other States and Territories it does not have an initial budget of such a size that a 20% cut can be catered for within the overall budget for AESIP initiatives. For example, the Northern Territory will cater for this cut by cutting its funding allocation to Bachelor College and have the Commonwealth completely fund Bachelor College on its own, thus freeing NT resources for expenditure on other programs, (not necessarily Aboriginal Education, this is only presumed). The ACT does not have such bargaining chips with which to induce the Commonwealth into arrangements that allow the ACT to strike similar deals. Whereas in the ACT public sector schooling this may mean that 2.5 Aboriginal Education workers will disappear from our schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory has programs such as Batchelor College because of the fact that at the time that such educational programs were set up the mentality was that people on the Eastern seaboard were not as disadvantaged as people from the "remoter areas of our continent". In the case of states such as the Western Australia and Queensland who are attempting to roll over significant amounts of funds' (I believe that in the case of Queensland that it as high as . . . . . . . . . . . . .and in Western Australia $900,000) 20% cuts of total allocated funds for 1995&mdash;not the amount spent, will mean that the 20% cut will have little real impact in terms of the systems to adequately resource the delivery of services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would suggest to you that the proposed "per capita funding" will have a significant impact on the ACT's capacity to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with the basic services expected under AESIP. In the long term, it may mean that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community within the ACT will not be provided with the same opportunity as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities from other parts of Australia to access the benefits of the work of the MCEETYA task force on the Education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People as the resources necessary to facilitate the running of those strategies and programs will not be available to the ACT because they live in such a geographically small area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would put it to you that the comments made by the member for the Northern Territory Mr Snowden, are applicable to the ACT:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The other important aspect which I do not think is properly understood is that, because Aboriginal students do not have the success rate as the broader community for a range of reasons&mdash;one of which is failure to provide services in many cases&mdash;. . . . . . . . . they are doubly disadvantaged."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the ACT this means that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community is triply disadvantaged:  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a)not only are they failing to access mainstream services due to mainstream services inability to cater for specific cultural needs and socioeconomic disadvantages bought about by the inequities and gross violation of human right perpetuated against Aboriginal people; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b)because of the commonwealth allocation of the AESIP funds to date, minimal resources allocated to the ACT has resulted in a minimal level of services and programs which other Aboriginal communities across Australia take for granted under current funding arrangements; but</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c)under the future arrangements they are also being denied access to sufficient resources to provide additional services which are designed to cater for specific strategies under the AEP and the recommendations from the MCEETYA Taskforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the "per capita basis "translates as "bums on seats" then we would be faced with a ridiculous situation were CEO, CIT and DET would be fighting for students (poaching students) in order to maintain funding levels. For eg, a parent convinces a year 10 student to remain at school and complete year 12, however, a tafe recruitment drive targets the student because it is in their interest to have that student in a TAFE classroom and not in the school room, the interest of the student is ignored or explored as a secondary consideration. Similarly Liaison Officers advising of transfers of students between the Catholic system and the Public system. This is not as far fetched a scenario as it may seem. It is already happening. In short a students education becomes unstable as a result of the competing pressures which are put on them by the various providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We consider these issues to have a profound and detrimental effect on the delivery of educational services from early childhood to secondary schooling, and seek special dispensation for the ACT.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Airports Bill 1995 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1995 which establish the framework for the leasing of 22 Federal Airports Corporation airports. The bills typify the Labor Party's approach to privatisation and are a case study of the way that the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, deals with his portfolio. The coalition supports the privatisation of the airports but will be moving a number of amendments to these bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional bill sets out the legislative framework for leasing the 22 airports and the Sydney West airport, and for resolving the financial and personnel issues raised by the leasing process. The Airports Bill establishes the regulatory system that would apply to the airports once they are leased and would apply to the successful tenderers. The airports would be leased for a period of 50 years with an option of a 49-year extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of sections of the bill are particularly interesting. Part 3, for instance, would establish a 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership of airport lessee companies, a five per cent limit on ownership by airlines, and a 15 per cent limit on the cross-ownership of the Sydney-Melbourne airport pair and the Brisbane-Sydney airport pair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 sets out a range of land use, planning and business controls. Airport operators would be required to submit master plans and master development plans to the Minister for Transport for approval. Airport operators would also be required to submit their environmental plans for approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key issues raised by the leasing process is that of the maintenance of existing service levels and a hopeful reduction in charges. It is interesting to note that only some weeks ago the minister decided to enforce upon the industry an increase in the charges that would lift the sale price of the airports. One of the reasons for leasing the airports was hopefully to organise a system whereby, with the efficiencies generated, there would be a reduction in charges which would benefit not only the consumers but also the tourism industry. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, already has the power to monitor the charges imposed by airport lessees. Part 8 of the bill would enable it to monitor the quality of the service that it provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most interesting aspects of this bill is the Labor Party's attitude to privatisation. The 22 airports are another of those national assets that the Labor Party promised to keep in public hands. The now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in 1985 that the privatisation of authorities like the Commonwealth Bank or TAA was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . simply vandalism of Australia's great public authorities, which in no way deals with the problem of cutting recurrent expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities in the hands of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>I remember over the years hearing ALP members and senators speaking in horrified terms about the possibility of airports being privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As recently as 1986 the then Minister for Transport, Mr Morris, said that privatising the airlines and the airports was a dangerous policy. The ALP's 1991 platform said, `Labor will ensure the Federal Airports Corporation remains in full public ownership, operates on an efficient basis and continues to develop along competitive lines and establish similar public owned undertakings where appropriate.' Yet today we are debating the privatisation of the airports. We have already seen Qantas sold, and now we have a bill which will privatise the airports&mdash;a device in the government's view to reduce temporarily the budget deficit rather than encourage competition and the development of innovative services. The light on the hill has turned out to be a neon sign saying, `Labor principles for sale at a price.' That is what it is all about. It has nothing to do with the matter of efficiency, competition or of saying that certain things should be run by the private sector. It is simply a matter of saying, `We cannot resist getting our hands on the dollars.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to recognise the great work done by the Federal Airports Corporation. When the corporation came into being in about 1988, there was a little pea and thimble trick; a little creative accounting. The FAC was given some $600 million of debt on assets where there was not a debt in the past. The taxpayers of Australia paid for the construction of airports. The FAC was given a debt of $600 million and was told to do all the expansions that could be done to improve the efficiency of airports, which is what it did. It did it very effectively without coming back to the budget. Now the government is saying, `You have an asset which is worth a lot of money.' Estimates floating around the place show it to be in the order of $2 billion. I guess the scoping study would have a more accurate figure than that. The government is saying, `Here is an opportunity for us to bring back money and then artificially reduce the budget deficit.' It is the old pea and thimble trick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the government has approached the privatisation process is a case study of how this government operates. It has been characterised by ruthlessness, arrogance and a determination to crush anyone who disagrees with its views. The list of casualties in the Department of Transport alone and the statutory authorities under Mr Brereton's control is an extensive one. We have seen the resignation of the head of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Doug Roser. We have seen the resignation of Vanessa Fanning, the Principal Aviation Adviser to the Department of Transport. We have seen the movement of Graham Evans, the Secretary to the Department of Transport. We have seen the resignation of Bill Swingler, the Chief Executive of the Federal Airports Corporation, who, when the government took off him the role of determining airport charges, took the view `What else have we got?' and thought it better to resign. Just recently, we have seen the resignation of Mr Sandy White, the General Manager of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brereton sacked the board of ANL and replaced them with his mates, Mr Neville Wran and Mr Malcolm Turnbull. The FAC board made the mistake of questioning a lot of the things that were being done in regard to the leasing process, so Mr Brereton got rid of them too. It is interesting that, on the very day that I attended the opening of the Brisbane international airport&mdash;which is, again, a credit to the Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;and when the speeches were given, a senior person in the FAC remarked to me, `This is the first time the minister has said a nice word about the FAC.' The then chairman of the board responded in glowing terms about what the FAC had done&mdash;and quite correctly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that day, there was an item on the AAP saying that the board of the FAC was resigning. The curious thing was that no-one on the board of the FAC knew they were resigning. It was only a few days later that someone told them that they had to resign. What a way to run a business! What a way to run a government! That is the way this minister operates. He got rid of the whole board, and he again brought in a board of his own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister ignored any objections raised by people throughout the consultation process. For example, he ignored the industry's concerns about the demand management provisions in the bill. Part 13 of the bill would give the minister wide ranging powers to impose a demand management scheme on the airport without consulting the airport operator or the airport users. The minister did not consult with the local authorities around the airport. In his second reading speech to the House of Representatives on these bills, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth has undertaken extensive consultation with a range of interested parties, including the states and territories, local government, the airlines, the aviation industry, other airport users and potential investors.</PARA>
<PARA>This is totally untrue. I have been visited by and received letters from local government people&mdash;and maybe my colleagues on the other side have received similar letters&mdash;who assure me that they have had no consultation whatsoever. They only knew about the draft bills put by this government when they read about them in the newspapers. How can you trust a government like this? How can you trust a minister like this? The minister must have known darn well that there was no consultation, yet he made the statement&mdash;which was also in the second reading speech in the Senate&mdash;that he had consulted with local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some concerns from local government people, and I understand their concerns. They would like to have a clause in this legislation that requires the same good neighbour practice that occurs with the Federal Airports Corporation, as they believe that it has worked fairly well. There are some in local government who would like to go a lot further, but generally the view of the people on the mayoral councils and the people who are interested in these major airports is that they would like a similar type of clause in the legislation&mdash;which is presently not there&mdash;requiring the same good neighbour approach that was in the Federal Airports Corporation legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Calvert, the reason for it is that they would be able to get a fair return based on the sorts of services provided to the airport, but not to the extent that it could damage the efficiency and cost of running the airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position is that we support the leases. We always have. We have not changed. It is this government that has decided that it is going to make sacrifices. These sacred cows of the Labor Party have said, `We would never privatise the airports. That would be dangerous,' and other things like that. Imagine, Senator Forshaw, what the left wing of your party is thinking about this now. These were icons of the Labor Party&mdash;but not any more, for just 30 pieces of silver. You have a price. You are not as cheap as the Democrats, but you are getting close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our position is we will only support these bills on two conditions. One is that the government resolves the noise problem of Sydney airport by reopening the east-west runway and conducts a genuine EIS on Sydney West airport. We have debated this in recent days, but the reason for this particular amendment is that, until October last year, Sydney had two active runways&mdash;two runways, two active runways. In November last year the third runway was completed. Lo and behold, we have three runways, but only one and seven-eighths are active. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, people&mdash;mainly in the north, but certainly in the south around Kurnell&mdash;were subject to aircraft noise that they never dreamed of. They believe they were deceived and lied to. The only way to address this problem is to give the authorities three active runways so that they can have the flexibility to address the three competing ends&mdash;noise, safety and capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That mode of operation is one that is supported by just about everyone, except those who are instructed otherwise by this government. There have been only two groups that have actually come out and supported the government. One is the Air Services people, and you have to expect that. As I said the other day, they have said quite openly that their job is to respond to government policy and to support government policy. They have got no option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other group was the airlines. As I mentioned in the debate on the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill the other day, their credibility is not helped by the fact that the minister ran around town two weeks earlier saying, `I'm going to get these airlines to sing my song.' He has got the power to do that. He has got the power to frighten them. But, offset against that, we have got experts&mdash;the pilots, the air traffic controllers and people like Flight Transportation Associates out of Massachusetts&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving an amendment to bring forward Adelaide airport into the first tranche of airport privatisation. The reason for that is that this is what the South Australians wanted. It wasn't a knee-jerk reaction on our part. Adelaide is in the same category as Perth. The sale of the Adelaide airport is not affected one way or another by the sale of the Sydney or Badgerys Creek airports. It is a stand-alone operation with regard to the sale, the same as Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's proposal, this would have been delayed at least a year past the sale of the first tranche. The view of the financial institutions and of all the prospective buyers when consulted about this was that they did not know why Adelaide was not included in the first place&mdash;no reason at all. I will be moving amendments in the committee stage to incorporate these conditions in the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our first condition relates to Sydney's disastrous aircraft noise problem. The government's decision to concentrate the noise generated to the north and south has devastated the lives of some hundreds of thousands of people. Air Services argue that some 75,000 are affected by the noise, but that figure does not take into account many areas affected by aircraft in places such as Ku-Ring-Gai. They weren't included. They weren't on the contours of being affected. The methodology used by Air Services is based on a survey conducted in 1992 in areas that had been subjected to aircraft noise for years. The results were not applicable to areas where the aircraft noise level has changed dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concentration of aircraft in the approaches to the parallel runways is more than just an annoyance; it raises a whole lot of other serious concerns in respect of health and safety. According to Sydney University's Faculty of Medicine, the health effects could include an increase in cardiovascular disease, hypertension due to stress, sleep disturbance and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concentration of aircraft movements in the approaches to the parallel runways has dramatically increased the risk of an air accident in the suburbs. It is not the fact that the potential will increase, but the fact that these aircraft are now crossing urban areas. It has been calculated by some people that in many instances they are crossing some 60 kilometres of built-up areas. When various questions were raised on this matter, the point was made that this was a policy decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a lot of policy decisions. One was to virtually close the east-west runway; another one was to narrow the flight corridors; and another one was a crazy one suggested by the minister to increase the glide path on landings from three degrees to six degrees. That was discounted even by the Air Services people. They couldn't bring themselves to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Professor Cross, a statistician from the University of New South Wales, the risk of a crash of a scheduled aircraft in Marrickville with the third runway operating is one in 15.6 years. In any 10-year period, between one and two crashes could be expected. That is the potential. These are the sorts of problems raised. They are the reasons why we will move two amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To recapitulate, the first amendment reinforces that it is not for people in parliament&mdash;as this government has done&mdash;to tell an airport operator or the equivalent of Air Services how to run its airport. It gives them the flexibility with three active runways to come up with a solution that will address those three major competing problems&mdash;noise, capacity and safety. The second amendment will simply bring forward the sale of Adelaide airport and put it in the same category as Perth. To argue, as the minister has done, that this will somehow delay the extension of Adelaide airport is as phoney as all the other things that this minister says from time to time when he gets half a chance. </PARA>

I find it quite remarkable that Senator Parer and others on the other side see there being some virtue in this negative approach; see that there is a virtue in saying, `We will not support this, even though we do support it. We will try to create a situation where nothing occurs. We will support it, but we will not give it support on the floor and we will not give it support in the community. We will not accept responsibility for our view. We will not offer an alternative policy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Airports Bill puts forward a framework to allow for long-term leases of the major airports that are presently administered by the FAC. It does not necessarily change the operational limitations on airports. By retaining the legal ownership of the airports, the federal government is ensuring that the regulatory powers and planning regulations they have in relation to airports are retained. The whole effect and purpose of this bill is not to visit some sort of further affliction on the general community but to protect the community interest, the communities surrounding the airports and also those who utilise the airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would take this opportunity to look a little more closely at some of the restrictions this bill puts in place and what effect their non-compliance has. Section 14 of the bill requires that there be a single lessee; that the lessee be a qualified company, which is defined in the definitions section of the bill as being a company over which the Commonwealth has constitutional power; and that the lease provides for the use of the site as an airport, except in relation to Sydney West or airports where there is a joint user. The fact is that, if there is non-compliance with these particular terms of a lease, or if there is non-compliance in the transfer of a lease or the extension of a lease, the lease becomes void. In fact, there can be no stronger requirement than, if there is non-compliance, that the legal document which purports to be a lease has no effect whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also sets out extensive limitations in relation to the type of company that can take up a lease on the airports. The foreign ownership of the company is limited to 49 per cent; airline ownership of any company which takes up a lease is limited to five per cent; and there is a limitation of 15 per cent on cross-ownership for companies that have the lease of Sydney and Melbourne or Sydney and Brisbane airports. This means there are safeguards in place to ensure that a monopoly is not established and that there is ongoing competition between the airports to ensure continuing efficiencies and a better service for both the airlines and the people who utilise them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment has been foreshadowed by Senator Parer which I have not had the advantage of perusing, but I assume that I will see it at some stage. I suppose I can take a bit of a guess, from Senator Parer's comments and the general thrust of the coalition arguments in relation to the airports, at what it contains&mdash;particularly in connection with Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the coalition's view always is that what is bad news for the community is good news for them because it may reflect badly on the government. I would think there must be some concern within the community to see an amendment being put up which essentially would delay the construction of Sydney West airport and, by doing so, make it more difficult to curtail and resolve the noise problems that presently exist at Kingsford Smith. The fact is that a large amount of the revenue that will be obtained from the leasing of all these major airports will go towards the construction of Sydney West. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to be put forward by Senator Parer and the coalition, which says, effectively, that there can be no leasing of Kingsford Smith, would have two major effects. If you have a look at the profitability of the various major airports covered by this bill&mdash;19 in all&mdash;the largest profit earner by some distance is Sydney airport, which last year earned $62.6 million. Even though Sydney earned that amount, the total dividend paid to the government by the FAC for all those 19 major airports was only $8 million. The reason for this is very clear: there is major cross-subsidisation between Sydney airport and other airports that are less profitable. Melbourne and Brisbane, admittedly, do make a profit but certainly not in the same range as Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the effect of the amendment proposed by the coalition? It means, essentially, that the source of income which is needed to construct Sydney West will not be available. What is the solution? The solution for the coalition is no real solution; it is just an attempt to stymie the process, to stop the community being provided with a solution, to stop Sydney West airport going ahead and to ensure that everyone is tied up going nowhere and achieving nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does provide a number of other limitations in relation to planning aspects of the airport. It requires substantive approval by the minister to a number of matters that involve the operations of the airport and the planning provisions, particularly in regard to Sydney West. All these are retained. What is lost by the leasing out of the airport is the ongoing requirement by this government to inject capital into the airports. It has to be noted that the FAC over the last few years&mdash;since about 1988&mdash;has substantially improved the standard infrastructure of all the airports in preparation for this leasing out. But this is a process that cannot go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government and the ALP see there being many other priorities&mdash;that, if there is a capacity to have an ongoing and worthwhile infrastructure by way of the airports, where the capital input is being provided by a private source leaving public moneys available for other priorities of the government, they see it as a worthwhile thing. The other priorities of the government are Medicare, education, Working Nation and the provision of long-term jobs for those who have been out of work for a long time&mdash;all provisions on which we can spend our money that make it better for members of the community, rather than spending it on putting more capital into the airports when a private company would quite happily do that. My view is that, where there is an alternative available, as there is, and that it is possible to put into place safeguards, as they have been put forward in this bill, we should inject the government funds into our higher priority areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a few comments to make about some of the issues raised by Senator Parer which were not strictly in relation to this bill. But these raised again, I suppose, our last debate&mdash;and they do say that generals always fight their last battles&mdash;in relation to the safety issue at Kingsford-Smith. Senator Parer clearly continues to not understand or intentionally misunderstand the position that, because it is possible to run intersecting runways reasonably safely, it is equivalent to intersecting runways being the safest option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that no-one has ever asserted&mdash;whether it be BASI, Airservices Australia, me or any other member of the committee&mdash;that it is unsafe or impossible to safely operate intersecting runways. What has been asserted by all those parties, and particularly by the government members of the committee, is that it is safer to have parallel runways; that it is not worth while taking the risk of having intersecting runways when the option of having parallel runways is available. As I pointed out on the occasion when last I was on my feet, it was always the policy of the coalition to support the construction of the third runway. However, now they have found there is a political issue to be made of it, they are tap dancing around, trying to say that the position is the same whilst at the same time, in fact, opposing its construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government readily recognises the difficulty of airport noise. There is certainly a large amount of sympathy from me and many other members of the government as to the effects of noise on the community surrounding the airport. Attempts have been made to reduce that by placing restrictions on the pathways that the planes are taking and by requiring noise amelioration in the homes, schools and churches that surround the airport to ensure that at least when people are inside and all the doors and windows are closed they are not as badly affected as they were. Despite all that, a proposition such as closing down the airport completely or removing all international flights out to Sydney West, if it is ever constructed, is just not a viable option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A substantial amount of Sydney, New South Wales and the Australian economy is dependent on tourism, and the airport is an essential part of that. There certainly is some scope in the future once Sydney West is built possibly to ensure that some of the noise is shared by the Sydney West airport, but I cannot see, and I do not think any responsible or reasonable member of the coalition would ever suggest, Kingsford Smith being closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had the opportunity to view the other portions of the amendment that Senator Parer is proposing. I suppose we  will have the opportunity of debating that in committee, so I will not attempt to deal with those now. I do wish to mention a few matters raised about the Labor Party's change of position and the fact that some time in the past government members have opposed a proposition to privatise the airport, as this is described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say this bill and the scheme which it proposes clearly is not a complete disposal of the ownership of the airports. As I said earlier, this bill only envisages a lease of 50 years plus a further extension of 49 years. Upon the end of that term, I suppose it will be up to the government of the day to determine whether those airports go back into public ownership or whether the private leasing continues. But I think there is a major difference in principle and in policy between a sale of an asset owned by the government and leasing, though long term, as proposed in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I would like to say that no policy is immutable. I suppose if you have been out of government for a while you might forget this but circumstances change, views change, new ideas come to the fore and different approaches are revealed. Because a policy that appeared the best option at a particular time was chosen does not necessarily mean that that policy is unchangeable forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always have an open mind to see whether something can be done in a better way. I do not think it is necessary to say that because 100 years ago a certain policy was the right one it is necessarily the right one now. Major mistakes have been made. I am a member of a party that once believed in a white Australia policy. Because that was the policy of the people involved in the party at the time who thought it was the right one does not mean it is the right one now. I, and many people in the Australian community, do not think so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this airport bill does something worth while. It allows us to protect the community interest, to retain a long-term ownership of the airports and, at the same time, to free up resources of the government to be utilised in areas where I think there is a higher priority&mdash;that is, in health, in the support of families and in reducing the number of long-term unemployed. I commend the bill to you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate since the government has handled things so badly that we have over 70 bills to go. I just want to make a few points about airports in general. The opposition's case has been very well put by Senator Parer in opening this debate. We are dealing with two bills&mdash;the Airports Bill 1995 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1995, which transfers the ownership of some airports which essentially are owned by the Commonwealth through the Federal Airports Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airports are terribly important facilities for a country. They are comparable with seaports in bygone centuries. They can bring a great deal of wealth to a community if they are properly handled. When this government came to power we had the Department of Civil Aviation which owned the great majority of airfields in Australia&mdash;the majority from a use point of view. A lot of smaller strips were owned by councils and private individuals but essentially the DCA owned most airfields. Its whole approach was just to provide an airfield or an aerodrome and provide landing facilities for the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Labor came to power it decided to split the Department of Civil Aviation, under its economic rationalist theories, and create a Federal Airports Corporation to look after the airfields and a Civil Aviation Authority to look after all the rest of the aviation business. The objective in doing that was quite a laudable one. It was to create a more efficient structure and thereby lower the cost to the community, because transport is a very big factor in Australia's GDP. It takes a very large slice of what we do and the cost implications from transport flow through to everything in the Australian community. So anything that can keep the costs down is a help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Labor Party, with its usual inability to handle economic matters, did not handle the FAC very efficiently. It sold the airfields to the newly created Federal Airports Corporation at highly inflated values and then demanded a high return on those. It also did not give the Federal Airports Corporation any directive other than it had to make money out of the airfields. The government did not counsel the corporation quietly on the needs to operate airfields in an efficient way. The FAC took the view that it had a monopoly and that the consumer was going to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did see a very sharp increase in prices when the FAC took over. To illustrate the point, if you look at the airports around Australia, you will see that Australian capital cities have a primary airport to which the passenger aircraft go and secondary airports where the charter and some of the commuters operators go and training takes place. Those secondary airports probably got by&mdash;this was the case in respect of an airfield I know quite well&mdash;with a chief groundsman and maybe two or three staff. Once the FAC was ensconced there was a staff of 10 or 12 people&mdash;all of them on very high salaries, all of them getting new cars every year, mobile phones, the whole lot, and the overhead went up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those secondary airports, on FAC figures, make a loss. They make a loss because they are carrying a large bureaucratic staffing establishment, which they will never be able to support in a creation of tomcats because the business simply cannot be generated from those secondary airports to carry the managerial strata they have on top. Also, they put a very heavy figure in for depreciation each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several months ago the government tried to increase or put pressure on the FAC to increase those charges a great deal more. That would have been entirely counterproductive. Fortunately, the airlines were effective enough in protesting against it and stopped it going through. But had that gone through we would have had this high income on paper from the airfields, which would have enabled the FAC and the government to get a much higher price for those airfields when they were sold. That would have built into the cost structure of Australian aviation an artificially high capital cost to purchase the airfields, which would have to be amortised and built in in perpetuity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever changes take place in the future, we need to get some stability and permanence into the business of the ownership and management of airports. I do not wish to rehash the argument that this chamber has spent so much time over about noise at Sydney airport, parallel runways, cross-runways, and the rest of it, but the fact of the matter is that you are always going to have a noise problem with airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aircraft are getting quieter and quieter with the advances in technology, but there will always be some noise. You cannot solve the problem by building new airports, by moving to a greenfield site 30 miles away from the present one, because as soon as you put in a big airfield, you have to have communications links and road and rail links to it. While it might be in virginal bushland when it starts, these links attract people because of cheaper housing and cheaper land. Ten or 15 years later, as is happening now at Tullamarine, you will find you have a noise problem. So we have to cope with this noise problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has to do something in the way of defining approach paths and saying, `This airfield is here for the foreseeable future. These are the approach paths and departure paths from the airport. Anyone who lives under there has to put up with some noise.' There has to be some degree of permanence in this. We cannot just keep moving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country, although it is relatively underpopulated, spaces or sites for airfields are restricted. It would be very hard to find anywhere at the Sydney basin that you could set up new airports or just a new airfield because the land is at a premium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another advantage of having airports that are recognised is that it concentrates aircraft and maintenance at those points. If we have a plethora of small airfields the way the United States has, surveillance by the regulatory authority becomes that much more difficult. It is highly desirable that we try to maintain the system that we have developed in this country&mdash;purely, I suppose, by trial and error&mdash;over the last 40 or 60 years of having a primary airport for the capital city and a secondary airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time the only airports that are being sold are the primary airports, but later on the secondary airports, at places like Moorabbin, Bankstown, Parafield and Archerfield will be sold. I hope there is provision for those airfields to be linked to the primary airports which are being sold at the present time because I see one supporting the other. The high volume traffic which will always go through the primary airports with passenger movements, with the regular public transport services, provides a big economic base and those airports can be, and should be, very profitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supporting airports, the secondary airports, by the very nature of their role simply have difficulties in paying their way, even if they do not have the bloated staff that the Federal Airports Corporation has imposed on them at the present time. But they are essential in so far as they provide a training and support facility for the industry that is necessary to keep it in place. With those few words, I finish my speech by saying that I have much pleasure in supporting the amendments moved by Senator Parer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must at least congratulate Senator MacGibbon on keeping his contribution short because he did not make the same error as Senator Parer did, which was to go on for about 20 minutes and regurgitate all of the old, hackneyed arguments and really contribute nothing of substance to the debate on these very important airport bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to recap very quickly on the purpose of these bills because it is important to note that, when it comes to changes in position, it is the opposition that has constantly changed its position in respect of aircraft noise issues and airport issues in Sydney. In fact, they have had more go-arounds and aborted landings than you would probably get from a Qantas jet prior to the construction of the third runway at Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airport bills that are currently before the Senate are an integral part of the government's overall strategy with respect to reforming the operations, development and regulation of federal airports throughout Australia. But of course the particular focus in this debate has been on the operations at Kingsford Smith airport and the proposed Sydney West airport, and also with respect to Adelaide airport as a result of the opposition's proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just reiterate&mdash;of course it has been so well covered by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in introducing the bill and also by Senator Neal in her contribution&mdash;that the strategy is to provide for the leasing of major airports throughout Australia in two stages&mdash;the first stage being the four major airports of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth to be leased in the first phase. That leasing in Sydney will be jointly leased with the new airport at Badgerys Creek, known as Sydney West airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal is that the leases be by way of 50-year leases, with the option for a further 49 years. There are specific requirements within the bill that require each lessee to be a company set up to operate the airport and that there be only one company assuming each particular lease. There are, of course, other particular restrictions with respect to ownership and control, namely, a 49 per cent limit on foreign ownership and a five per cent limit on airline ownership. There will be a 15 per cent limit on cross-ownership for Sydney and Sydney West-Melbourne and Sydney and Sydney West-Brisbane airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's proposals in respect of the leasing of the airports have been carefully thought out, market tested and designed to ensure the maximum return to the taxpayer whilst also ensuring that the Commonwealth ultimately maintains ownership of the airports and, in particular, and most importantly, of course, continuation of Commonwealth regulatory control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his contribution, Senator Parer referred to privatisation, and particularly to the government's decision to propose this leasing arrangement for airports. He tried to take a cheap shot at the ALP by suggesting that somehow this was a massive turnaround by the Labor Party on this issue. Of course there is no doubt that in a party like the Australian Labor Party, which represents people right across the length and breadth of the country and not just particular sectional interests, there has been a rigorous debate on the issue of privatisation of government assets. What is important is that we are prepared to change when change becomes necessary, to revisit long held policies of the Labor Party and to take the responsible decisions, sometimes at some political cost. We are prepared to take those responsible decisions when they are in the interests of the country and in the interests of the economy. There is no doubt that this decision is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the government's proposals have been carefully developed and market tested. That is important because when you then come to look at the amendments proposed by the opposition you have proposals which will strangle that entire process. We have an opposition that comes into the Senate and into the House and says, `We are in favour of privatisation. In fact, we have been telling you for years that you should privatise, sell off all these government assets.' They propose that with very little regard to all of the things that flow from it, such as the need to maintain regulation. They have had a policy over the years of `flog it all off as quickly as you can'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They come into the Senate and say that they are in favour of privatisation and support these bills. However, because of base political expediency in the run-up to an election, they want to do a backflip and dissect the legislation. Firstly, they propose that the leasing arrangements for Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport be held up until the east-west runway is reopened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a position that they have come to in recent times. It has really only been over the course of the last few months that that decision was taken by the opposition. They have come to that decision notwithstanding the fact that they have known about the proposals with respect to the development of Sydney West airport, its interrelationship with Kingsford Smith and the government's strategy on leasing federal airports for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no accident that the opposition has made this quick decision to tack onto the airport bills a significant constraint that the sale should not go ahead until the east-west runway is reopened. They quite mistakenly think that they can gain some sort of political mileage out of this and that they can save the seat of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) by appealing to the people who are disaffected by aircraft noise. They tried this tactic with respect to the airport curfew bill. It did not work then and I have no doubt that it will not work this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposal that they have put up is that Adelaide airport should be included within the first phase. I will deal with the proposal, which once again has been advanced my Senator Parer on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, to reopen the east-west runway. I have heard Senator Parer speak about this quite often and I have also heard the Leader of the Opposition speak about it. I have read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> their comments about what they said a couple of years ago when they supported the construction of the third runway, the parallel runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have detailed those comments and I do not need to go through them again other than to say that at the time the decision was made to construct the third runway they knew full well that the east-west runway would be closed once the third runway was opened. I will quote two members of the opposition whom I have not referred to in the past. It is very enlightening to read what they said. The Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, said on 13 August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government must make three decisions: firstly, to accept the expert advice that the third runway is environmentally more friendly than the present two runway set-up; secondly, that safety is of paramount importance; and, finally, the vital tourist industry must no longer be choked off through lack of sensible economic thinking.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth while concentrating on what the Leader of National Party, Tim Fischer, said on that occasion. He said that three decisions should be made. He said the first one was to accept the expert advice. I would suggest that such experts would be Air Services Australia, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, the Federal Airports Corporation and air traffic controllers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tim Fischer also said that the third runway is environmentally more friendly than the present two runway set-up. The option to build the third runway because the present operation at Sydney&mdash;namely, the intersecting runway operation&mdash;was less environmentally friendly was clearly identified. That system distributed aircraft noise over more residents in Sydney than the parallel runway operation we have now does. Tim Fischer was correct. He recognised that at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tim Fischer said that safety is of paramount importance. We have had lengthy debates about safety with respect to this issue. It has been said time and time again to remind the opposition that the position of the experts and the position accepted by the government is that parallel runway operations are inherently safer than intersecting operations. I will come back to that point in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tim Fischer said that the third decision to be made was that `the vital tourist industry must no longer be choked off through lack of sensible economic thinking'. That is precisely what the opposition's amendment will do. If you excise from the proposal the leasing of Sydney airport and delay it until such time as the east-west runway is reopened, you will strangle the process that is integral to making Sydney West airport operational. This has been made very clear. An essential part of the funding arrangements for the construction of Sydney West airport results from the leasing of Kingsford Smith airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's amendment will destroy or certainly delay for a significant period of time the construction of Sydney West airport. That would have a significant impact on the tourist industry, but it would not be a beneficial impact. It could well have a disastrous impact. The minister announced in the budget that the construction of the two runways at Sydney West airport would be fast-tracked in order to make them operational in time for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. The opposition is putting in jeopardy that very tight timetable. We cannot afford to have this sort of politicking, this sort of base political expediency, simply to save the member for Bennelong's neck. We cannot afford to have that sort of approach to such an important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other effect is that the longer you delay, the longer you procrastinate, the longer you fool around with all of the issues relating to the construction of Sydney West airport, which is subject to a most rigorous EIS project, and the longer you subject the residents of Sydney to increased noise, the more pressure you will create with airlines and others seeking changes to such things as curfews at Mascot airport. We will not accept that. The history has been that, whenever the problems are exacerbated at Sydney airport, we immediately get calls for certain other changes to reduce congestion. That is why the construction of Sydney West airport is vital to this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I wish to come back to is this issue of sharing the load, which seems to be at the heart of this proposal by the opposition to put a constraint upon the implementation of the leasing process by deferring the sale of Sydney airport until the east-west runway is opened. As I have said, I have heard Senator Parer and the Leader of the Opposition speak many times on this. But I actually looked at what was said by the first speaker for the opposition when this matter was debated in the other place, and that was Mrs Bishop, the member for Mackellar. On 17 October she said that privatisation, in respect of Kingsford Smith airport, should be delayed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">until such time as the question of the noise burden over Sydney is dealt with in an equitable and fair manner and there is a resumption of full operation of the east-west runway at that airport.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is incredible that the member for Mackellar would raise that issue and talk about the distribution of noise in a more equitable and fair manner across Sydney, because Mackellar has to be one of the few electorates in Sydney that has very little, if any, aircraft noise and has never had noise. </PARA>

Grayndler has the most intense noise and has always had it. Sydney, Lowe, and even the electorates of Blaxland&mdash;which has the Bankstown airport&mdash;and Parramatta have experienced increased noise. Of course the other area in Sydney, Kurnell, whilst in a Liberal electorate, has been a solid Labor voting area ever since I can remember.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens are not inclined to vote in favour of these airport bills. We do not like the idea of privatising the management of airports in Australia. Australian airports, as represented by Sydney, for instance, which are managed by the Federal Airports Corporation, a public company, have been deemed to be fourth lowest in operating costs and charges in a study of 40 major international airports. The Federal Airport Corporation's productivity is higher than in Europe, and the Federal Airports Corporation is a profitable company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why do we want to privatise airports? One justification is to eliminate the cross-subsidies the major airports pay to support the smaller regional and general airports. Why is that such a great goal? All that will do is make it harder to support smaller airports. It will shift the cost burden from international and major domestic route fliers to the taxpayer or to regional fliers and private planes if cost recovery avenues are pursued. Why is that such an important goal, especially since the cross-subsidies do not seem to make the major international airports excessively expensive or uncompetitive?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the guarantees that a private operator, in what will in effect become, in the case of Perth, a private monopoly, will operate in the best interests of the consumers? I do not see any indication that, in the history of market operations, private monopolies feel obliged to operate in that way; that is, to decrease charges and make sure the consumers are the beneficiaries of any lower charges. If it is a monopoly, it is certainly not in their interests to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the impact on consumers in major airports, what guarantee is there that elimination of cross-subsidies would make things cheaper? In other countries, including those with private airports, this does not seem to be the case. It may be a situation where the private company becomes more competitive because it is able to cream off the profits of government changing cross-subsidy policy. So they will have less costs and they will just pocket the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to question the basis of productivity gains in terms of passengers per staff member. These are often not productive or beneficial at all from the viewpoint of consumers if it simply means cutting back staff so that they are always busy. Passengers requiring assistance from the Federal Airports Corporation may have to wait longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of privatisation are therefore dubious, except for the companies managing airports. To the government's credit, they seem to recognise that taking responsibility for airports out of the public domain means that public goals and wider considerations not having to do with bottom line figures will no longer be able to be pursued directly&mdash;I hope they were once. Accountability is no longer direct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative is to regulate and specify what the duties, obligations and requirements are for private companies. These fall mainly in the social and environmental sphere. The fact that the government did not always consider these issues and that, if it ignored them, there were no guidelines or regulations to enforce them to act, means that having explicit guidelines may be considered to be a bonus. But it does not change the fact that the ability of the people to pursue broader agendas which include aspects of airport activities has been reduced. I will speak about it later because, if you are incorporating those rules into a lease condition, the communities are concerned that any changes to those planning arrangements that occurred at the time the lease was sold may well not be subject to any stringent guidelines if the community do not know about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cross-ownership or cross-control issues seem to have been resolved reasonably. There have also been attempts, through limits on foreign ownership, to limit the absolute foreign control implied in ownership of over 50 per cent of stock. However, I am not so certain that a simple restriction limiting foreign ownership to 49 per cent limits effective foreign control, or that effective control in this case has been considered or addressed as thoroughly as it has been for cross-control of multiple airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirements, obligations and regulation of airport ownership seem to be reasonable. Attempts are made to assure minimum environmental standards of both state and Commonwealth will be met on the basis that the airports remain Commonwealth land, so falling under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act as well as falling under state legislation. This is important since some states seem willing to override environmental regulations or requirements in the interests of commerce. The process of establishing the requirements, obligations and regulations seemed much less consultative than we would have liked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also concerns about the ability of the Commonwealth to make exemptions by regulation under clause 132. In questions to government, it also appears that the standard procedure will primarily be for administration of environmental requirements by the Department of Transport rather than the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have concerns that community consultation is still seen by government as consultation with relevant state agencies and local government representatives or organisations rather than consultation with the community or community based non-government organisations. In particular, we would like a commitment from government to consult with local government NGOs on airport issues. Often these local environmental bodies are the people with the most expertise on the local environment. They include the naturalists who actually spend time learning about that environment and have some idea of what the local bush or swamp really is in terms of diversity of species, ecological interaction, seasonal significance and importance to migratory species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to note how little is known about the Australian ecology. In Perth, at Murdoch University&mdash;and there are probably more ecologists per square inch at Murdoch University than anywhere else in Western Australia&mdash;which includes a small area of bush amidst extensive housing development, a PhD student in zoology recently discovered two new species of lizards in the course of his PhD research. The point to take away is how little we know and how significant remnant ecological islands can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These remnant ecological islands are often not conservation reserves, often not intentionally biotic islands. They are often areas where the land use has meant they were difficult to develop or unable to be developed. For example, the old explosives reserve at Woodman's Point in Perth, because it was not regularly burnt over, is now the last example of the Rottnest cypress coastal environment that once was typical of the entire coastal region, the offshore islands and the Swan River foreshore. It only survived because you cannot have fires on explosives reserves. Likewise, the undiscovered lizard species at Murdoch probably only survived because the university had not had the desire or capital to develop its back acreage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airports, with their buffer zones to avoid proximity to noise and potentially dangerous runways, are often similar biotic islands. Development of airports may then have great significance to species. Often, the local naturalists are the only ones who will have any real idea of this impact. The generalists of the state EPAs&mdash;that is when there are enough people to employ to be staff in EPAs&mdash;seldom have this sort of detailed knowledge. It is therefore extremely important to build in a liaison with local groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very important to have a direct link with the community. The voice of the community is increasingly being represented by&mdash;in terms of federal government communication&mdash;local government associations. The process is far from universal and far from reaching the stage where talking to a local council&mdash;that is if it gets to the local council&mdash;can be taken as the equivalent of talking to the local people. In Western Australia&mdash;and it might be the case in other states&mdash;the federal government only talks to the local government associations. Therefore, the communication is very indirect. So when we are told that Belmont council, Guildford council and so on have been advised, it has only been through the local government associations. That means the communication has been very indirect and not satisfactory, according to those councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such a circumstance, it is important to have a mechanism for direct consultation to discover and address the real concerns of the people affected. I can just imagine, if it were a change affecting a particular industry, how the industry would feel if you said, `Oh, we're only going to talk to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and not actually talk to the industries concerned.' This is the kind of thing that has been happening in these cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when there are circumstances where the federal government does finally talk to local councils, there are a number of councils which, I am sorry to say, are not used to making their decisions open. They are actually used to keeping decisions close to themselves. It is only when the community forces them to open up those decisions that they have some sort of process, if at all. So we have to deal with the fact that in many cases we are responding to the community, as in Sydney, but there are lots of places around Australia which may well be affected by these changes to the Federal Airports Corporation airports which do not even know what the implications are because their councils have not seen fit to talk to them. You might say that is a problem for the councils; I think it is a problem for the government. It means you are not yet aware of what a full consultation process is with those people who have a stake in the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to see the government go from a pseudo consultative model, where selected bodies are asked and then government does what it thinks best, to a more participatory model, one in which efforts are made to identify those affected and in which the groups consulted have some direct control in the decisions that are made, the way they will be implemented, and also have some ability to review the decisions and implementation, and change them if change is required. This might seem strange, outrageous and revolutionary, but if what you are talking about is a massive change in Australia in terms of competition policy, for want of a better phrase, you have to start thinking about what the real processes are and use that community network to find out what the real impacts may be of these decisions. Otherwise, you will go too far, too fast and it will be too late to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, we think the government has made an effort to set a regulatory framework for privatisation of airport management. We congratulate them for attempting the effort, while feeling that they could have done more. However, this effort is predicated on the fact that regulation is required because the airports will be leased. It sets the regulation as lease conditions but community participation requires notification and plans can change. If what is required is that those private bodies are required to present their plans to the community, there is not necessarily anything in here to the effect that if they change their plans they once again have to present that to the community for community participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It sounds like it is not required, but how will the community ever challenge the level of environmental assessment if they do not know that something is happening? It might be that government, CEPA or whoever, in their wisdom or otherwise, decide that such a thing is not going to have great environmental significance. They might not be aware of the significance. It might be Aboriginal heritage, it might be environment, it might be community noise, inconvenience or safety. If the community have not had to be alerted to the nature of changes as they occur, the accountability enforcement may simply become a private matter between a private business enterprise and the Commonwealth government. Okay, you trust the government; however, there needs to be some realistic mechanism by which the community can feel confident that their level of community participation is a real one and that there is some requirement that major changes&mdash;even sometimes what might be considered by the Commonwealth to be minor changes&mdash;are advised. People must have a right to ask for an assessment and, as is often the case in environmental assessment, to challenge the level of assessment if it appears to be inappropriately low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, we reject the current proposal to lease airports. We reject the way it has been rushed through. We reject the fact that the only groups that seem to have participated are the ones already affected by bad planning. Therefore, you are missing the opportunity to do things better by having a better process. We will be voting against the legislation. </PARA>

That follows the government's announcement as part of the 1994-95 federal budget that it would proceed with this privatisation program during this year. They are quite determined to do it. The Australian Democrats will not be supporting this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few pieces of government legislation have generated so much mail to my office as this one has. Virtually all the representations which my office has received on this issue have been from Sydney residents pleading with the Democrats to reject the legislation and criticising the federal government for totally ignoring community concerns about what the legislation will lead to. We believe those concerns are well founded. Residents near airports, and especially those in Sydney, have every reason to fear what privatisation will lead to. There is no doubt that for many of them a privatised Kingsford Smith will only exacerbate their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise was established, the Democrats ensured that the privatisation option was included for close examination within the committee's terms of reference. When the Democrats suggested to the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), quite reasonably, I thought, that he consider delaying the introduction of the legislation until the committee had the opportunity to report its findings on privatisation to this parliament, this suggestion was rejected out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, during the debate on the Airports Levy Bill earlier this year, senators will recall the fact that the Senate passed a second reading amendment to the bill urging the government to delay the introduction of this legislation that we are dealing with today until the committee had reported. The opposition supported that amendment at the time but we now find they have changed their mind and they are of the opinion that the legislation should be treated as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no stage has either the government or the opposition explained why they believe this legislation is so important that it should be given such a high priority over other legislation currently on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. For that matter, neither has explained why it is that this legislation is so important that the parliament cannot await the findings of the Senate select committee which is due to report shortly on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation represents another sorry chapter in the government's disgraceful program of selling off everything and anything which once belonged to the people of Australia. At times, it is extremely hard to believe that a Labor government has been in power during the last 13 years. The government's program of privatisation and sell-off has been carried out so comprehensively and with such speed that a conservative coalition government could scarcely have carried out a similar program with such vigour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one is misled by the government's usage of the euphemism `leasing of airports', as is used in this legislation&mdash;certainly not the hundreds of people who have written to me or who have phoned my office outraged that the government is embarking on this privatisation program of Australia's airports. The fact is that leasing for a period of 99 years, as set out in the terms outlined in this bill, effectively means forever. It effectively means selling off. Unfortunately, this now means that a future Australian government will have no aviation policy options on this matter and will be forced to make decisions within the confines of this legislation regardless of what it might consider is in Australia's best interests into the future or even the local public interests of specific airport sites around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A government that sets such a framework in concrete for years to come will undoubtedly be judged harshly by future generations. None of us can predict the future with any certainty but what we do already know is that privatised airports will undoubtedly choose to resolve problems, such as the ones currently being played out at Kingsford-Smith, on the basis of the private interests of a few and not what is in the overall public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that we currently have at Sydney are likely to be replicated elsewhere in Australia. That could include Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and many of the regional airports as decisions are made on the basis of short-term private interests. This has enormous implications for things such as volume of air traffic around Australia, flight paths to be used and whether a curfew is set in place. The list is endless. As the volume of air traffic grows and more space is required, there will continue to be a conflict between the interests of surrounding residents and how best to operate any airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When an airport is privatised, it is inevitable that the interests of the private operator will overrule the public interest every single time. The government may well respond that there will be regulations in place to provide some form of protection but, as we all know, how much difference has the government's regulatory regime made to the communications area in this country? The reality is that just as private interests in that field reign supreme behind a veneer of government regulation, so too will private interests dominate in airport policy. Indeed, many of the problems now being experienced at Kingsford Smith airport are the result of successive governments&mdash;Labor and Liberal&mdash;allowing private interests to dominate, and hence compromise, government policy in the development of Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third runway saga, for instance, was primarily about both major parties giving into the demands of private air operators. Worst of all, the government abandoned all its existing environmental impact assessment regulations to fast-track the construction of the third runway and then proceeded to gloat about how it would finish construction ahead of time. This point has been made before by the Democrats in debates on Sydney airport. It probably needs to be made again here. If more attention had been paid to due process and if the proper environmental safeguards had been adhered to, many of those problems which we are now experiencing at Sydney could have been foreseen and could ultimately have been prevented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this bill marks a continuation of the pattern already set in place by this government. The minister's office boasts that they have had numerous discussions with potential private investors for Australia's airports. Public consultation does not appear to have been as high on the agenda. The reality is, of course, that hardly any of the relevant community groups have been consulted on what they consider to be the adverse impact that will flow from the passage of this legislation. Important community representative groups such as the Australian Mayoral Aviation Council and the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales have written to the Democrats in recent weeks expressing profound disappointment with this legislation and with the government's complete lack of interest in consulting with affected groups. Frankly, this is totally unacceptable on the part of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, there is nothing in this legislation to assure Sydney residents that the problems at Kingsford Smith will not get worse under a privatised regime. There is an expectation in Sydney that if the Sydney West airport ever comes on line, it will take over from Kingsford Smith as the main international and domestic airport for Sydney. Understandably, many residents fear that when KSA is privatised, there will be absolutely no incentive at all to have the site at Sydney West fully developed as Sydney's main point of entry for air traffic. Equally, people who live at Badgerys Creek near the site of Sydney West are also worried about what conditions will be like for them under privatised or, indeed, not privatised, conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the significant deficiencies in the Airports (Transitional) Bill is the failure to require the Federal Airports Corporation to conduct either an environmental impact statement on its activities or require the FAC to conduct an environmental audit of assets and liabilities. This is remarkable given that these days it is standard practice for organisations the size of the Federal Airports Corporation to be subject to environmental audits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that given the size of the amount involved in the whole privatisation program, such an audit should be mandatory. In the case of Sydney airport, for instance, an environmental audit would also highlight the liabilities of Kingsford-Smith, in particular to potential litigation over airport and air traffic management, noise pollution, carcinogenic effects of aircraft activities and toxic contaminants as well as other forms of pollution in and around the vicinity of the airport. It is worth while noting that no Commonwealth legislation exists to deal with the hazardous wastes or pollution and, thus, it is likely that in this case New South Wales legislation would apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that under the legislation an environmental master plan is required to be developed for each airport site, it would seem appropriate that prior to the sale or lease an environmental investigation should be carried out. Under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act an activity of this scale should undoubtedly require an environmental impact statement. The requirement for environmental management and environmental assessment cannot be understated. The Democrats fear that under the legislation the need for such environmental safeguards have been substantially overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are also concerned that these bills provide for significant controls, both environmental and corporate, to be included by way of regulation. There is considerable discretionary power vested in the minister. This makes a mockery of any public consultation process when it is possible to override or totally ignore for all practical purposes any public comment. The use of delegated legislation in this way to control environmental activities and to regulate and protect the environment runs against the trend of an open, transparent and public decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, there is no provision in the legislation for any decision maker to determine which factors must be considered paramount. It is usual to provide a hierarchy of goals to enable decision makers to assess in an objective manner specific criteria. For example, there is no guidance as to whether commercial, environmental or social objectives take priority, but I bet I can guess which one always would. Inevitably, this will lead to confusion as to exactly how decisions are to be made under this legislation. The Democrats believe that the legislation should mandate that the minimisation of noise impacts is a primary consideration and should outweigh commercial interests. The absence of such safeguards represents a significant oversight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant oversight in this legislation is that it does not make it clear that state laws have a role in the operation of Australia's airports. It has previously been demonstrated that while the courts believe that the Commonwealth has covered the field in environmental legislation, in practice, that is not the case. The Democrats believe that it is entirely inappropriate to legislate in a way so as to enable a commercial operator to ignore environmental considerations that are applicable to all other corporate enterprises. If competition is deemed desirable, it must be competition which is carried out on an equal basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that these bills are substantially flawed. The Democrats will not, however, be moving any amendments to the legislation because, frankly, what we have before us is an absurd situation. The government knows that this legislation will effectively be gutted by the amendments proposed by the opposition. Those amendments will render the legislation next to useless. I have no idea why they are so determined to proceed with the bills under these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the opposition's amendments are nothing short of remarkable, given their history of support for privatisation generally over the years. In their case they need to spell out fairly clearly what their intentions would be on privatising Australia's airports and, in particular, Kingsford-Smith, if they happen to win the next election. Given the opposition's history of support for privatisation over the years, it is perhaps not surprising that many Sydney residents concerned about the future of Kingsford-Smith are somewhat surprised by the opposition's proposed amendments. As I said during the recent debate on the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill, the electorate is not stupid. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the fundamental question: why is the privatisation of airports deemed okay by this government and this opposition? Virtually all major airports overseas have traditionally been publicly owned and operated. That is a fact, and Australians should be asking why we are deviating from this. The government has tried to dress up its decision to sell airport leases as a major micro-economic reform, but we know it is not. We know what it is about. It is about raising some quick dough by a government that wants to carry on with this psychology of a surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect, though, that we may end up selling our airports for a price a lot less than the net present value of retaining them&mdash;a concern echoed by public finance expert Professor Bob Walker and by FAC managing director, Bill Swingler. Last year, Mr Swingler predicted that the sale could raise as little as $1.5 billion&mdash;$1.2 billion less than that predicted at the time by Treasury. This would follow the less than expected return on the Qantas sale&mdash;a sale regarded as of almost fire sale proportions by former Qantas chief Jim Leslie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats would argue that little, if any, micro-economic benefit will flow from the new airports regulatory regime.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us think about the rhetoric here because the reality in the case of airports is that the scope for competition between Sydney and Melbourne airports or between Sydney and Perth airports is very remote. Not just is disaggregation against the world best practice of keeping airports together in a network; it is against the advice of the FAC. Mr Swingler scoffed at the competition argument, arguing that there is no competition between airports because people fly to destinations because of location attractions&mdash;not just the airport. That is just plain obvious, particularly in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The merit of breaking up the very profitable FAC into a string of single airport companies is not immediately evident. The FAC and many industry observers are not convinced. Community and industry leaders in regional Australia are absolutely horrified. Airports by their very nature have a monopoly aspect to them. The only place where there was the potential for competition was between Kingsford Smith and Sydney West, but the government wants to sell them as a package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a monopoly, the consumer benefits of the private sector running airports are only as good as the regulator overseeing them. We need to ask some fundamental questions, beginning with: are our airports now inefficient and will the private sector run them so much better that the regulators might be able to force them to deliver lower costs? The Democrats think that the answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC is a very profitable GBE. This year it recorded a record profit of $128 million, Sydney airport recording $69 million; Melbourne, $52.3 million; and Brisbane, $43.5 million. By the standards of the Stock Exchange, its earnings over assets ratio is up there among the top three or four firms, ahead of the Big Australian, BHP, and ahead of News Corporation. Its productivity, measured by the passenger per employee ratio, increased by 14 per cent in 1994-95 following the 15 per cent improvement the previous year. Its fees are the fourth lowest of a world representative listing of 40 major airports, with increases kept below the CPI over the past five years. So the FAC is doing a pretty good job. Who should benefit from that? Mr Swingler asked the question last year: if an organisation is achieving the shareholders' objectives, why sell it? Australians, as shareholders, are entitled to still ask that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why indeed sell it? Not just are airports a natural monopoly being run fairly efficiently in the public sector; airports are by their nature incredibly influential on the quality of life of nearby communities. Communities should be entitled to express their views on demand management at airports&mdash;on curfews, on usage, on tourism promotion, on the balance between general aviation and commercial aviation, and so on. The running of an airport every day requires a long string of decisions made in the public interest. It is impossible to divorce the commercial aspect of running an airport from the public policy aspect. For more than almost any other utility, the Democrats believe this is the case. In short, there is a good, long list of reasons why airports should stay in public hands and few good reasons why they should be in private sector hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the privatisation wave across the world, virtually no country outside the lunacy of Margaret Thatcher's Britain has sold its airports because other governments throughout the world realise that to do so is to get rid of a utility that is too vital to a community, to its commerce, to its quality of life and to its environment to be trusted to private sector hands. That is not to disparage the private sector but that is to point out a few obvious things. There are no market forces to constrain the private sector on airports. Competition will be at the margins only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place we have a difficult enough time getting publicly owned companies to stay accountable to their consumers. I remember, Senator Cook, the AIDC CEO salary level debate we had in here recently where you said, `Oh, we can't do anything about it even though we are the major shareholder.' The chance of a privately owned company&mdash;one where the major shareholder is not the government but, more than likely, an overseas investor&mdash;having accountability to the Australian people as its primary objective is practically zilch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever we have given up public ownership in this country, we have given up a whole range of accountability processes&mdash;a point made by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Phillipa Smith, in her recent annual report. It becomes much harder for the public interest to get a look in when the company is run solely for the private interests of the shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard people talking about how ideas change with the times, as if to say all privatisation is a good thing. We should assess privatisation on a case by case basis. In doing so, we should be seeking to determine whether, in all the circumstances, it is of economic benefit and of community benefit for the asset to pass from public to private ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On airports, we can unambiguously state that the benefits of this bill to the community at large will be negligible. The big beneficiary of this decision is the government, desperate to raise fast cash in this way and wanting to avoid the harder task of engaging in public dialogue to decide what is the best and fairest way to raise revenue for the kind of expenditure that is needed to maintain a decent level of services in this country in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne dealt with the issue of this bill and its impact on Sydney airport. I wish to note only in passing that more noise from Sydney airport will be an inevitable consequence of this bill. I hope I am wrong, but there are some pretty compelling realities we cannot ignore, such as: how will airport lessees increase their profits? They have two main ways: cutting costs or increasing airport usage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Sydney airport, where the number of movements is regulated, the lessees will seek to increase revenue, in my view, by reducing the number of smaller, low fee-paying aircraft using the facility and increasing the number of high fee-paying jet movements. Operators such as Hazelton have expressed concern that they may be squeezed out by such movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will say the regulator might try to restrict such occurrences. In the absence of tough initial legislation, in the Democrats' view, such attempts are doomed to be unsuccessful. The government has already shown a strong reluctance to make this legislation as tough as it ought to be. To do so, they fear, will reduce the ultimate sale price. And we would not want to do that. We would not want to put the community impact first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of this bill will mean that pressure to land bigger, louder planes more often at Australia's airports will increase dramatically. In dealing with a private sector company which bought a lease on the understanding that it could increase its revenue in this way, the public will have less control of the skies above their heads than ever before. That is the human and community aspect of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we have heard, in the main, from the government and the opposition are the old buzz words `micro-economic reform' and `economic impact'. We should learn from the third runway debates in this country that the legislation has demonstrated that community impact is just as important as financial impact dressed up as micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a bad time to be asking the Senate to vote for this bill. I urge senators to vote against it, on economic grounds, on public policy grounds and on environmental grounds. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has been ignored in this debate, in my view, is the tyranny of distance. Senator MacGibbon made some mention of it, but I am talking about the tyranny of distance for an island state like Tasmania, where you do not have any competition from land based transport. A land based transport system to cross Bass Strait has not been invented as yet. We are relying more and more on airline traffic to and from Tasmania. The only alternative is the ferry that crosses from Devonport to Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister will recall that I drew to his attention in August 1994 a number of questions I had already asked of the Treasury Department in estimates committee about the issue. One question was whether there was a natural monopoly element in the provision of airports and whether it was compatible with competition policy for there to be privatisation of a natural monopoly. As Senator Kernot mentioned, some government speakers&mdash;not all that I heard, but one or two this afternoon&mdash;in their own hearts were rather against the sale of airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address directly the reason for the government's policy position on this matter. I suppose its reason is the classic micro-economic reform basis, and that is to improve efficiency and to reduce costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why I am raising these issues goes precisely to that question, in the hope that the minister, in his response and perhaps in the committee stage, will elaborate a little. It seems inconsistent to me with such a policy that one would privatise a natural monopoly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal now with the question of competition. One of the questions I asked of Treasury was whether competition can occur between airports in different cities. In their prepared response the officials instanced Hobart and Launceston as potentially competing airports. I do not know whether the Treasury officials who prepared the response have ever been to those places. Surely the Treasury officials do not suggest that Hobart and Launceston could be competing airports. I will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury officials also said that the sale of airports was being `carried out with a view to increasing economic efficiency rather than simply maximising sale receipts for budgetary reasons'. At this stage I am reminding the minister of what I have asked. I asked, `If it is not all about money, why doesn't the government just hand the Tasmanian airports to the local authorities so as to protect Tasmanians from the whim of monopolists?' That is one matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that I want to raise with the minister, going to the issue of principle, is this: I can understand the government's desire to maximise the sale proceeds from the disposal of airports. As I said in a letter to Mr Brereton, I believe that there is an apparent conflict between that desire and the economic efficiency objective of providing infrastructure to all comers at marginal costs. If we are talking about infrastructure development, over the years the taxpayer has contributed. There was a need for that contribution because that infrastructure was required to facilitate travel at the most reasonable cost possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to debate this government's failure to effectively address the problem of youth suicide in this country. The Keating government is showing a callous disregard for mental health and the social crisis as a result that is facing this nation. This is the other disgrace of the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence&mdash;a disgrace that relates fairly and squarely to her responsibilities as minister for health in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister has set back progress on addressing the problem of youth suicide by years. The allocation of $12.9 million over four years is inadequate by any measure. The sum total of this government's initiatives in the past year is absolutely pathetic. They have announced the expenditure of the money twice. They have sacked one advisory committee dealing with suicide prevention and replaced it with another. That is some record in the last year! All of this mismanagement has occurred while the nation faces economic loss and people face great personal pain because of the very high rate of suicide, particularly youth suicide, in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response to this crisis by Minister Lawrence and the Keating government is an absolute disgrace. The cold statistics of suicide in Australia scream out for robust action. The problem has been documented by the minister's own department of human services in a paper called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth suicide in Australia: a background monograph 1995</EMPHASIS>. This paper indicates that Australia is recording one of the highest rates of suicide in the world. The youth suicide rate has doubled under this government in the last 10 years. We now rank in the three highest rates of youth suicide in the industrialised world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World Health Organisation figures show Australia in 1993 as having the fourth highest rate, on a list of 14 countries, for youth suicide deaths among young males between the ages of 15 and 24. Some estimates place suicides in Australia at 3,000 a year. It is a more common death for young Australians between the ages of 15 and 24 than road accidents. There is said to be, according to the minister's own department, 30 to 40 suicide attempts for every actual suicide amongst young people. That is around 100,000 attempts per annum. One hundred thousand young people in Australia try to take their lives every year. Young males living in rural and remote areas of Australia have a consistently higher rate than the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet what is the government's response to this? The response is $12.9 million over four years on suicide prevention. Compare this with the $800,000 bill&mdash;and still rising&mdash;for the legal fees on a private matter for the health minister, Dr Carmen Lawrence, that has absolutely no connection with her ministerial duties. I think the comparison of those two figures puts into some perspective the priorities of this Keating government. Self-interest is obviously reigning supreme in the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lawrence blueprint for kerbing this unacceptably high rate of youth suicide is full of holes. It is a deceptive and incompetent approach. Minister Crowley, representing Dr Lawrence in this chamber, outlined these inadequate policies in full detail. Let us examine what information Senator Crowley provided the Senate on 25 October this year on behalf of Minister Lawrence. We are told that the youth suicide prevention initiative was going to cost $12.9 million, the initiative commenced at the beginning of the current financial year and the money is to be spent over four years. This financial year $1.3 million will be spent. What a pathetic figure for the scale of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look more closely at the detail, you can see that the Keating government and Minister Lawrence are peddling a dishonest and ineffective policy. Of the $12.9 million trumpeted by Dr Lawrence only $1.3 million will be spent initiating several projects in this 1995-96 financial year. We are told that the projects are national demonstration projects that will be thoroughly evaluated before dissemination across Australia. We should have best practice models for suicide prevention in place now ready for implementation. This government have been in power for 13 years, yet they are setting up demonstration projects in this major area of social concern in Australia. This crisis will continue on and lives will be lost while the government just tends to dally with these sorts of activities that are greatly delaying what should be an effective range of strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the statement, and I refer the Senate particularly to the following aspects. The statement says that there will be support for general practitioners and community health personnel to identify, refer and treat young people at risk of suicide and that this project is currently proceeding to tender and will be advertised in November&mdash;a pilot project that still has not even got off the ground. This pattern is repeated throughout the minister's statement. Let us deal with another one. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An initiative in rural areas to prevent and respond to suicide. The tender . . . will be advertised in December of this year.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the detail? Why the delay in getting started? It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Development and demonstration of hospital and health service protocols . . . tenders for implementation will be advertised in . . . April 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It goes on to deal with intervention programs for persons with suicide tendencies and says that this project will be advertised for tender in 1996. This statement tells us that there is planning for a youth suicide strategy, but it has been greatly delayed under this minister. We have the worst suicide rate in the world, and after 13 years the government is still considering its strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate should condemn this minister, Dr Lawrence, for failing to note the contents of the NHMRC expert group report drafted in October 1994. Professor Peter Baume and a panel of specialists in the field of suicide prevention drafted this report and the minister at that point just ignored its contents. Lawrence said that the NHMRC dissolved the committee, and she ignored their recommendations. Valuable and precious time was lost between that point and now, when they are calling for tenders of particular projects. How many lives have been lost during that time and how many families have been devastated by the effects of youth suicide in Australia while this government dallies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the government has formed another youth suicide prevention group. It has been formed to inquire and bring down another report. What will be its fate? Will it suffer the same fate as the Baume committee? This minister has now set up two committees and announced the same allocation of money twice. Her record on this is appalling. Her plan for the future is too little too late. Suicide is costing us, in money terms, $100 million a year, but the personal misery is incalculable. Lawrence has failed the people of Australia by her incompetent handling of this major health crisis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express my concern to the Senate about the increasing use by governments of gambling as a means of raising revenue&mdash;firstly, because I believe it is a most inequitable form of taxation and, secondly, because of the social costs involved. I have collected a large amount of information and I want to quote from a number of sources about this issue. The first source I want to quote from is the Uniting Church's Victorian synod statement on gambling which raises a lot of concerns particularly about the Melbourne casino. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians lose around $6 billion each year on gambling and this is on the increase. There is little doubt that the development of the new casino in Melbourne will contribute to this increase. For some people the casino will mean enhanced entertainment opportunities at little financial cost, for others it may mean a new job, for others it may mean entry into organised crime. For a growing number of others it will mean poverty, loss of dignity and immeasurable hardship and suffering, not only for the gamblers themselves but also for their dependents.</PARA>
<PARA>The church says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our response is shaped by our understanding of God's will for all humanity that people may live in dignity and wholeness, in harmonious relationship with God and reconciled to each other. Much of the Protestant churches' teaching on gambling has centred around the question of stewardship. Wesley's sermon on money in which his followers were told to "work all they can, save all they can and give all they can" gave no place for playing with money and placed individual industry and compassion firmly together. Gambling is not only wasteful of the gifts God has given but indeed it robs the poor and the needy of resources which could readily be given them to alleviate their circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The uncritical dependence of the government on gambling as a source of revenue raising with scant attention or concern for the social consequences is indicative of a value base which places economic growth above social justice. It is an ideology which permeates all facets of society and is antithetical to the gospel.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, from a secular source, a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> of 12 November, titled `Campus casino addicts', referring to my old university, the Queensland University of Technology. The report says:</PARA>

<PARA>The report quotes extensively Dr Brian Whitelaw, who could never be called a headline grabber or someone who was addicted to sensational reporting. If he is saying there is a problem, you can rest assured there is. Dr Whitelaw is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are very concerned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>at QUT, because&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have never had any reports of gambling problems before the new casino opened. There were certainly opportunities previously to gamble at the TAB and with the introduction of poker machines in clubs and pubs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now we are getting significant numbers. We are monitoring the situation very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to describe the problems that the QUT has uncovered with its students because of the new casino which opened just a couple of blocks away from the university. I do not want to take up the time of the Senate this evening but I do intend on another occasion to place on the record the research that has been done and the concerns that have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this is an issue which cannot be swept under the carpet. It is an issue which governments ought to take seriously. As Australians, we ought to be ashamed of allowing such institutions to proliferate in our society while not admitting that there are problems associated with them and, certainly, in no way using sufficient of the funds generated to assist those for whom the abuse of gambling has become a real problem.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me tonight, I will give only a brief potted history of some of the things that John has done and some of the issues on which he has campaigned very heavily since he came into this place in 1987. A well known area to which he has committed an enormous amount of time and energy is that of preserving what little remains of our old growth forests&mdash;forests of enormous environmental significance; forests that are still under threat, as this very week this government is making further decisions that will impact on what little remains of those incredibly valuable forest areas of great scenic beauty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John has been commenting about this issue since he first came into this place. He has called time and again for the development of an ecologically sustainable management strategy for our forests and for the forest product industry. He has called on the government time and again to remove barriers to investing in plantations and to retain and expand the tax exempt status for recycled paper products. He has called on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories ((Senator Faulkner) to enforce the national forest policy statement's moratorium clause. Indeed, we are still waiting for that, as that clause has not been enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John has forced the government to admit that there was no conclusive research showing that natural regeneration was a viable method of achieving sustainability for tree fern harvesting in our native forests. In January 1994 John stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Australians want to see old growth and wilderness forests protected&mdash;now, before it is too late. The Federal Government must take genuine and effective action to protect forests such as the Karri and Jarrah forests of south west Western Australia, the Great Western Tiers and the Tarkine in Tasmania, along with the Errinundra Plateau in Victoria's East Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA>John has called for the government's consultation process on old growth forests to be upgraded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have called for the urgent development of a comprehensive national reserve program. John has been at the forefront of trying to establish this and ensuring that that it is based on a scientific assessment of the range and types of areas which need to be protected. In 1993 John reaffirmed the Democrats' support for an independent role for the Australian Heritage Commission. He called on the government to redefine its forestry policy and the role of the Australian Heritage Commission. He also called on the federal government to follow its own national forest policy and act to ensure areas of high conservation value were protected from logging while the national reserve system was being established. Last year he called on the government to stop logging the Huon and Picton valleys, which was further degrading world heritage areas. Shoalwater Bay has been another area on which John has spent a lot of time and energy. The day before the final report was released by the commission, John&mdash;with Peter Garrett&mdash;presented a documentary on Shoalwater Bay to a media conference in Canberra after an extensive visit of that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking through the records of all that John has said and done regarding the Great Barrier Reef, I cannot do justice to him in the few minutes available to me tonight. However, I will briefly detail some of John's achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has warned that an oil spill disaster on the Great Barrier Reef was only a matter of time and called for greater regulation, including mandatory double hulls, of oil tankers in Australian waters. He has welcomed funding for the management of the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area via a commercial operator levy. He has raised questions about the role of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in the failed Magnetic Quays development on Magnetic Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John called for greater scrutiny of development applications in sensitive marine and coastal environments. He highlighted the impact of fishing, tourism, coastal development, mariculture, agriculture and other activities in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and urged the federal government time and time again to maintain its responsibility to the marine and coastal environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John raised concerns about maritime safety on the Great Barrier Reef again this year. In March he successfully moved amendments to enshrine the precautionary principle in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. John said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments mean the onus of proof for ensuring the reef is free from environmental harm now lies with developers and others seeking to exploit the reef area.</PARA>
<PARA>On the Daintree, John welcomed the launch of the Daintree rescue campaign and called for a well funded government package to protect the Daintree rainforest. But he also noted with concern the Queensland government's failure to provide matching funding for the Daintree rescue package in its state budget last year, and he criticised the federal government for making the rescue package contingent upon funds from the state, calling it a haphazard approach to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Water quality and water usage issues have been high on John's agenda. He has continually criticised the federal government for its failure to honour its promises to actually do something to clean up the Murray-Darling river system. He pointed out that research demonstrated that timber harvesting in eucalypt forests can reduce water production from those forests by as much as 50 per cent. He asked whether Commonwealth government approval of export woodchip licences was in breach of section 100 of the Australian constitution, which covers actions by the Commonwealth which impact upon water production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the United Nations World Day for Water last year, John called on the government to get serious about water pollution problems in Australia and to fund a national urban stormwater and sewerage program. He drew attention to the reports by the Sydney Water Board detailing the pollution of rivers, estuaries, harbours and oceans in that state from sewage and stormwater run-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will very briefly mention a range of other issues that John has been involved in. In 1993 he called for a moratorium on sandmining and for an inquiry by the Resource Assessment Commission into the mineral sands industry. Again in 1993 and on through 1994, he condemned the government for letting Australia become the only country in the world to seek an exemption to the London dumping convention to allow us to continue to dump industrial waste in the ocean. He reiterated his call in March of this year for the purchase of Canadian Air CL215 aircraft to assist in the protection and surveillance of shipping along the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John is best known nationally and indeed internationally for his strong stand on nuclear issues, including his passionate opposition to the mining of uranium. In May 1988, John said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No reliance can be placed on safeguards whatsoever. The process is a lie behind which the civil and military nuclear programs are established and maintained.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1992 John warned of a recent Swedish analysis which concluded that all RMBK nuclear reactors would be susceptible to a Chernobyl type explosion. He said that Australia could be a target for nuclear fallout should Indonesia build a nuclear reactor. He pointed out that, if we were exporting uranium to Indonesia, the fallout could well be of Australian origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 he introduced the Nuclear Power, Uranium Enrichment and Reprocessing (Prohibition) Bill to prohibit activities in relation to nuclear power production, uranium enrichment and reprocessing. John has continually reaffirmed the Democrats' opposition to uranium mining and to other parts of the nuclear cycle, and earlier this year he introduced a bill to prohibit the export of uranium to France while it continued to conduct its nuclear tests in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot finish without mentioning John's work on endangered species and biodiversity but, with my time running out, perhaps all I can say is that John's work inside and outside parliament on both these issues is well known. I am sure it will continue in that way after he leaves this place. I just want to say in closing that we certainly will miss John's contribution in this place, not just in relation to environmental issues, as Senator Hill pointed out, but in so many other ways&mdash;particularly on the science issue and keeping that on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We congratulate John for all he has done and all he has achieved. We wish him well in his retirement and hope that he recovers very quickly. We look forward to his continuing involvement as we move on to fight all the issues that I have mentioned and many others. The continuing battle will, I hope, still include his name time and time again. We wish him well in his retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by apologising to Senator Coulter for not being present in the chamber to open this debate, as I would very much have liked to be. For once in their lives, the opposition were not nearly as longwinded in the opening adjournment speeches as I had been led to believe they would be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the last appearance in this place of Senator Coulter. I suppose it is typical of the man and his interests that he should use his very last opportunity in question time today, in the aftermath of the triumph of APEC, to put a question without notice to me asking me whether the expected $3 billion worth of increased farm exports to Australia arising from the anticipated agreements are going to be ecologically sustainable and whether any consideration has been given to increased greenhouse gas emissions arising as a result of the increased trade in bulk goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good taste forbade me from talking about the way in which at least some of those emission problems might be reduced by having nuclear vessels transporting the bulk goods in question and good taste inhibits me from further dwelling upon that theme tonight and similar themes about the actual conceivable value to Australia of increased trade and economic activity of this kind. But it has been typical of Senator Coulter here. We have had our differences at question time. I cannot think of anything very much on which we have agreed but, nonetheless, it has been quite enjoyable sparring over the eight years of his presence here. He has made a unique contribution to this place which I do believe deserves recognition and respect on an occasion such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all products of our background and our experience. So long as I am not running the risk of this being taken as a condolence motion rather than a valedictory, I would like to say a little about John Coulter's background because it is very much a part of understanding the man that he is and the senator that he has been. He was born in Perth in 1930, attending the Nedlands Primary School, Wesley College and then the University of WA and the University of Adelaide, from which he graduated in medicine. After undertaking his medical residency at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and spending a short period in private practice, he became a medical resident at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during his subsequent career of over 20 years as a medical researcher that Dr Coulter really did make a significant and pioneering contribution on matters which he has pursued in this place with great vigour, in particular the dangers to humans of agricultural chemicals. It is well known that his commitment to speaking out on this issue&mdash;a matter about which he did feel then and continues to do today so strongly&mdash;in effect inhibited his advancement and, maybe, even put an end to his career with that institute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time a whole variety of his interests outside that work environment did reflect themselves in the issues that he took up and made contributions to advancing. His interest in yachting and diving led him into the conservation movement and environmental protection, with particular interest, obviously, on the marine environment and the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His concern about planning matters, which he took up separately, led to his involvement in the Town and Country Planning Association in the 1960s and a stint in local government in the early 1970s. He was a foundation member of the Conservation Council of South Australia and an office holder of that organisation. On a number of occasions, he was a councillor of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Prior to being elected to the Senate in the 1987 double dissolution, he lectured in environmental studies at the University of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees has admirably taken us through many of the quite specific scientific contributions that John Coulter made during his career, both before the Senate and subsequently. I think the contribution to this place for which we will most remember him is his work over the years on a whole variety of committees&mdash;initially, on the Industry, Science and Technology Standing Committee from 1987 to 1991 and then the Environment, Recreation and the Arts Standing Committee from 1987 to 1990 and its successor until 1994. He was until recently a member of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee and the chair of the companion references committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The select committees of which he was a member&mdash;the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs; Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia; and Health Legislation and Health Insurance&mdash;gave him a particular opportunity to contribute in areas in which he had expertise and a capacity as well as an interest in proposing alternative solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was the first Australian Democrat chair of any Senate committee, from May 1993&mdash;in this case, the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council, which posed certain challenges to the government at the time&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I don't think it is too bad in all the circumstances. Senator Coulter brought to this chamber a background and an interest, as I hope I have already indicated, in a wide spectrum of subjects which have in the past not received the kind of consideration in the Senate that they almost certainly deserved. I am talking about the protection of the environment, the dangers to human health of modern society and its work practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That contribution was marked by an unswerving commitment to his ideals&mdash;some of us may have been inclined to argue, at the cost of more practical, political and economic considerations&mdash;but was always combined with an uncompromising desire to achieve those objectives, those goals, that he set himself. While wanting to argue at all sorts of times and places about those particular objectives, particularly when expressed in legislative form, I do not contest for one moment that John Coulter's bona fides were absolutely clear-cut and straightforward. There was never any doubt about the intent and the motivation which lay behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I have always personally admired people of fierce passion and fierce conviction, even when I have thought that from time to time they might be a bit off beam in terms of some of the solutions they have proposed. Certainly, I admire that kind of contribution to public life and public policy infinitely more than I admire the trimming, the hypocrisy and the unwillingness to take seriously public policy issues that is so characteristic of so many people in public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always a matter of regret when a senator leaves at a time other than entirely of their own choosing, particularly due to ill health. We do appreciate that the rigours of an election campaign, even the relatively refined rigours of a Senate campaign&mdash;and I am now acutely aware of the difference!&mdash;can take a tremendous toll on those involved. But I do think it is unfortunate that Senator John Coulter is unable to stay until the end of these sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure he will not be wanting to `retire', in every sense of that word, to his farm with his wife, Phyllis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, I became aware of Senator Coulter much earlier than at the time I became a Senate candidate. In fact, I remember a very early speech he made that I was listening to on the radio. As that speech concluded, the comment was made&mdash;and I do not know whether it was someone from the government or the coalition who made it: `Senator Coulter, I'm not sure whether I understand what you've been saying, and if I did understand it I think I would disagree'. That was the comment they made, which perhaps says more about them than about Senator Coulter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, as a scientist, as I have listened to him over the years, I believe that he has made, on many occasions, thoughtful and very significant comment on these issues. As an environmentalist, of course, we recognise John's absolute commitment to the environment. I do not think anyone in our party, which has always been known as a party committed to the environment, has a stronger commitment than his. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise John as an economist. I am not sure many of you think of him in that way. But I remember a number of contributions he made that I think are quite unique and which I would like to underline. It was John who first, as far as I am concerned, raised the issue of the need for a steady state economy. He was one of the first&mdash;before it became a popular kind of buzz word&mdash;to speak about the need for an environmental and economic sustainability; many years before other people were talking in those terms, John Coulter was raising that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember a number of speeches that I found stimulating and which opened up for me a whole lot of new thinking&mdash;about the need to change the way that we measure economic growth not only in Australia but in the world; the problem of simply measuring gross domestic product as cash flow, without in any way measuring the loss or gain of national and natural assets such as soil, water and air; and the need to change to a measurement which took account of those things. It is only now at long last, after many years, that we have the Bureau of Statistics beginning to recognise something that John Coulter has been talking about to my knowledge for at least 10 years, but probably much longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to remember John Coulter's philosophy. He is certainly not a theist, but he and I come very close in terms of our appreciation of the need, in my terms, for a creation spirituality that appreciates the fundamental call to care for the earth. Perhaps that is his most enduring contribution. I certainly want to thank him for it. </PARA>

It is fair to say that when I was first elected to the Senate you were the leader of your party. It is no wonder that I did not really have very much to do with you in the first 18 months that I was in this place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always valued Senator Coulter's support on all the issues that the Greens have wanted to support in this chamber, in particular, the environmental issues that I deal with and also the nuclear issues that Senator Margetts has in her portfolio. In particular, I value the debate that we have had quite recently on the goldmine tailings dams. I think that was a moment of consensus in the chamber which was quite special. Each of the parties was unanimously concerned about the hazards those tailings dams do present to the environment, to the fauna of the areas, and about the need for them to be monitored and for the standards of best practice to be implemented by the mining industry in this regard. </PARA>

I noticed a subtle tendency creeping in as well that when Senator Kemp, in his role as shadow minister for the environment, had any detailed questions he did not even do me the courtesy of mentioning my name but simply asked you, Senator Coulter.

I have always been really happy to defer to your far better knowledge and exposition on the topics that we have shared in this chamber. I have sympathy for your deputy leader, Senator Lees, who will have to replace you in that portfolio.

There would be, I am sure, quite a number more senators in the chamber than there are now if it was not for the fact that there are other circumstances in this parliament which have called them away. I, for example, am a participating member of the legal and constitutional committee, and I have some questions to ask that committee. Unfortunately, whilst my back was turned, the Senate must have agreed to that committee sitting at the same time as the Senate.

Whether or not we agreed with Senator Coulter, he had a great deal to contribute to debate in this Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the night. There was a somewhat robust debate in the chamber. I must have said a few things. I cannot remember exactly what I said. But I was warned and then I was named. It was particularly awkward for the Labor Party that evening. All the people in the other place were waiting for all these bills to come down from the Senate so that they could go home and close up with that particular session. I stood up and gave an explanation of what I thought had occurred. I am not sure it was a very good explanation but, from memory, the Labor Party was very keen to accept that explanation. But, Senator Coulter, you tricked us all. You moved that I be suspended from the chamber. As a result, after a somewhat vigorous debate, I was then asked to leave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That incident enabled us to include ourselves in the history book, although not in a way that we would have preferred. After a senator is excluded from the chamber, it is very unusual for that senator to be asked back. Two hours later, after vigorous debate, it was decided that I should be asked back into the chamber so that the debate could be completed and the bills could be returned to the other place. Senator Coulter, although we have not had a great deal to do with each other over the years, in the seventh edition of Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> that particular incident is mentioned and, in that way, our relationship early on was recorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the sentiments that have been expressed by my colleagues in regard to the integrity of Senator Coulter, his hardworking nature, his great love of science and his commitment to the environment. I would agree with all those things, and I do not think they bear repeating. Despite the somewhat bad start to our relationship, I think Senator Coulter is a man who is true to his own light. It may not be the light that we see in the distance all the time, but Senator Coulter is true to that. He has pursued those interests with a great passion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his dealings with his opponents, Senator Coulter has been honest, even if he has not agreed with them. I know Senator Coulter has had his good times and his bad times in this chamber, but I do not think anyone here would have felt that Senator Coulter was not acting in a way which was integral to his own beliefs and values. I cannot draw on a widespread sharing of committee work with Senator Coulter. In fact, I am not too sure that we have ever served on a committee together. So our relationship over the years has not been as close as that of some other people in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concluding point I would make, which somewhat draws together my uncertain start, is that the great thing about this chamber and this parliament is the reinforcement that we all have of a democratic culture. We all come into this place with passionate beliefs and it is a good thing that they are retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways it is a pity when you find people who change course regularly and shift as required for more base political purposes. Being in this chamber teaches one a degree of tolerance. You have to recognise that people of goodwill can differ in opinions.

If we explored this at some length I think we would find quite a number of areas where we do agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of us learn a degree of tolerance.

I am not saying I received answers that I was completely on top of, but it did show on that particular occasion the strong commitment you have to particular issues and the science background you bought to this chamber which will certainly be missed. Some will miss it in a happy sense and others will miss it because of the contribution that you were able to make. I wish you well. I am sorry that you felt that it was time to call it a day.

Before that he was a medical practitioner, a medical researcher and a university academic. They are the things I know about. There are probably more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, John early on accepted that it was his responsibility to do everything in his power to save the world. That is why he came into this place. He did not enter politics for personal power or kudos, but to make sure that parliament got it right.

There is also his work on the Great Barrier Reef that has been mentioned tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unusual for a person to be single-minded, especially around here, but John is someone less common. His drive is based absolutely on doing what he sees, quite single-mindedly, as being right. That comes sometimes, and it has for John, at a considerable personal cost. It cannot be easy being a prophet, always looking ahead, always searching for what is right. I am probably not the only person in this chamber who has more than once been frustrated by John's vision, which always remains unclouded. It is never clouded by what is politic or possible in the so-called real world. He sticks to what is right. I think that he is right not to have taken the easy option in many cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in two capacities on the retirement of Senator John Coulter: firstly, as a senator, and therefore as a colleague, in this chamber; and, secondly, as science minister and someone who acknowledges that Senator Coulter, as the science spokesman for the Australian Democrats, has in this chamber and as a political representative contributed to raising the profile of science in the Australian community quite importantly and quite strongly. He deserves national recognition for that as one of his achievements out of a myriad of other quite important achievements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter will not know this, but I was aware of his impact on national affairs well before he would ever have been aware of me. It is a long and complicated story as to why that is the case, but let me shortly tell it. My father was a waterside worker from Port Adelaide and he transferred to Fremantle&mdash;I think this was in the very early 1970s&mdash;and rented a room in a house on Stirling Highway at Cottesloe, which was a house of Dr Coulter's mother, and rented the same room in which Dr Coulter as a younger man had resided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My father, who had a thirsty knowledge for anything of a political nature, had some discussions about Dr Coulter's career then, and his career then was of a person making an early and fundamental impact in the environmental debate in Australia, specifically in South Australia. When my parents returned to Adelaide, they followed Dr Coulter's career and kept me advised of it and, when he was elected to the Senate and I was elected to the Senate, they followed both our careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While they never voted for any political party other than the ALP, nonetheless they sometimes took up the points that Dr Coulter made in public debate in order to press some of these principles on their second eldest son&mdash;that is, me. You had an unknown, Dr Coulter, but nonetheless quite powerful lobby group&mdash;quite extraneous to your party&mdash;within my family. Therefore, I was aware of many of your early achievements as an environmental advocate in South Australia and only regretted that you chose the Australian Democrats, not the Australian Labor Party, to pursue those objectives politically. However, that is how it turned out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my political period here and Dr Coulter's, he and I have not got to know each other personally, but what we are here tonight to pay due recognition to is a Senate life of someone who has been, and who obviously will remain, active in Australian politics. I do not think being an elected representative means that you have a political career; it means you have a privilege to put forward the views that you hold and the views of the people who have appointed you to express them in a public domain. I think all of us have an obligation to pursue our political ideals, both inside and outside of politics. I have the very strong view, Senator Coulter, that your period here, while fertile in commitment and effort, is nonetheless not the end of your political career but simply by moving out of this place is transforming itself in another way and will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with all of those who regret that you are retiring prematurely for health reasons. I think that is unfortunate, but I do recognise that you will have more time now, as has been said, to pursue your political objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think is always difficult at a time like this is to assess the value of an effort that people make to politics. This is a demanding chamber. It calls for great energy and effort and commitment, not only by those of us elected to serve here but by our nearest family. In many respects, they bear the weight of it but they get none of the recognition or very little of the recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assessing a senatorial life, one has to look for what are the characteristic marks of respect from colleagues. I think that you have that. In my observation, you have a lot more than that but, from where I have sat in the chamber, your commitment has always been strong to the ideals that you hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept without question the views of your colleagues that often that may have meant some personal setback for you in pursuit of an ideal that you saw as important. That is the mark of someone who is a genuine person, and someone who has a genuine sense of purpose about their life. Whether I always agree with that sense of purpose is another matter, but to have worked out what is important and to have placed it ahead of personal gain deserves tribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my experience you would always seek to argue within a logical framework, to pursue your views with passion, to call up an encyclopaedic knowledge in defence of your own arguments and in prosecution of them, to be a worthy advocate for your cause and an enviable foe for those of us who sometimes found ourselves arraigned against you and for those of us who sometimes exalted in the fact that we were arraigned with you. In terms of what I have seen on the science front, there is no doubt, Senator Coulter, that you have a strong commitment to science. It is a commitment more to the understanding and creation of new knowledge about science, to pure science, than it is to any other part of it; to understand the nature of things and of the world and to pursue that in order to understand the meaning of things more profoundly, to do that with a certain joy and the happiness of discovery. I would like to think that as a science minister I might grudgingly perhaps make you proud of some of the changes we would bring to this policy for the government, but that is a matter for another time and another place.

In the first contest I had to be elected here in 1977 I was successful by only 1,000 votes over your colleague the Hon. Ian Gilfillan. I came here; that Democrat did not. The second contest, a month later, was as to who would replace Senator Steele Hall.

I respect the alternative decision that all of you whom I have just named have made to come here&mdash;at the moment, as seven, two and one&mdash;to contribute to this place.

Our mutual friend, Ralph Middenway, who I still see quite often, encouraged me to take an interest in the flora and fauna of the countryside in South Australia, and also our urban and regional planning. At the time I was elected urban chairman of the Liberal Party&mdash;it was the first executive office I held&mdash;in 1973. As urban chairman, my first project was to see an end to the then Dunstan Labor dream of Monarto. He was proposing a city which I thought was abysmally planned, in the wrong place and not properly worked out. Fortunately, that project of mine, joined by other allies in the Town and Country Planning Association, led to the demise of the Monarto concept and we do not see a city, not even one building, at that site which then Premier Dunstan outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I continue, despite scepticism from time to time even from John, to be a clear thinking, I hope, and careful environmentalist. I can never match the positions that John has taken on the environment but I remain within the coalition, in the chamber as well, a spokesperson for a secure environment where development is sustainable along with the environment. We may differ on some judgments but I, as a genuine environmentalist, salute Senator Coulter as, above all, a person committed to the environment. With your medical training, your scientific research and your knowledge of chemistry, you have brought an enormous concentration of effort to the issues of the environment in this country and, indeed, in the world. All of us have to look at the global environment, not just at this nation's environmental concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `sustainable development' is now writ large in the policies of all parties, whereas in the years before you came, Senator Coulter, it was only just emerging. You were ahead of others in the use of terms like this. I recognise those earlier speeches in this debate that emphasised this contribution which you have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of areas on which I do not think we will ever agree. For instance, the way you want to have a John Coulter definition for GNP will probably lead to a book. It will probably lead you to make some contribution to the theory of economics. I have tried to listen carefully&mdash;to your first speech here, out on the hustings and in various questions you have put which touch upon your view of GNP&mdash;and I am afraid I am still not convinced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with regard to trade. It appears even in your question today, as Senator Gareth Evans recalled it, that you are haltingly acknowledging that there ought to be any trade. I think you would want all of us to have sustenance just from our own efforts in our own little region. That is the impression you gave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember a solar energy debate that we were engaged in during the last election campaign, in which you were the spokesman for the Democrats and I for the Liberal Party. Certainly, the impression that I gained was that it is no good having any kind of trade&mdash;that is as I perceived it from Senator Coulter&mdash;because that will expend energy, which will lead to a greenhouse effect that is negative, and it is much better if we just live in our own little environments and not have the exchange of goods across the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Hindmarsh Island bridge is eventually built, whether the royal commission finds that the so-called claims are fabricated or not, I do not think you will be cheering but I will because it is a count for the development of South Australia. I want to assure you that, in my assessment, I believe it will not damage the environment. I must conclude by saying that I recognise your great contributions to the debates in this chamber. I wish you, Phyllis and all your family every happiness in the years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There you go, $26 per utterance. That is the sort of thing we have relied upon John Coulter for in our party. You sort of get the general direction right, then you just take a side word to John Coulter and he gives you down to the last, probably the fourth decimal place, what the particular precise matter is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John and I are a fair way apart in many ways: with me being fairly casual and not too fussed about details, with a general knowledge about nothing in detail and a couple of university degrees in arts; with John being a specialist, a scientist with precise detailed knowledge&mdash;a formidable array and amazing breadth of knowledge&mdash;and a person who enjoys stretching his own frontiers of knowledge. When I say `enjoys' it, you should have seen him in Papeete with the telsat satellite telephone. I knew that you had to just wiggle it around a bit and point it up to the stars. There is John&mdash;he could have had an azimuth and a calculator, the details had to be precise&mdash;but when he turned it on, click, there we were straight through. It was fairly symptomatic of John's relationship with me. Often with information technology, computers and such like, I have had a bit of an idea about how to get the agriculture direction right. But then John comes along with the precise knowledge that has enabled me over a number of years to get the eventual picture in a much more precise and useful way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I had several introductions to this John Coulter. One was in 1988 when he came to Hobart as my guest. I had not really worked out much about him. I think I had seen him once or twice in South Australia. He came to Hobart at my invitation to enlighten us a little more about the emergence of this greenhouse theory. Again, I had a fairly agricultural understanding of the general implications of it. I stood up at the University of Tasmania and introduced him to an audience by saying that he was a bit older than me and that he knew a bit more about the environment and stuff like that. Then I had to sit back and get overwhelmed with this incredible detailed knowledge and a scientific expose of what it involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, having been a little embarrassed by that introduction, some couple of years later I was with several other Democrats essentially as John's guests in a houseboat on the Murray and we were returning to port. I did not quite know where we were&mdash;I knew we were on the Murray&mdash;but it was getting very dark. There was Coulter at the wheel. Here he was demonstrating his immense breadth of knowledge and practical skills because he is a practical man. I do not know how we got through these guideposts and against the current and docked at the port, but we had John Coulter at the wheel using the stars, the currents, the satellites and some sort of mental logarithmic calculations. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been indebted to John for being able to bring precision to my generalities in a number of areas. I have invaded his portfolio responsibilities on a number of occasions because I have had a certain passion about certain subjects and John has been able to put me straight and fill in the details for me, whether that be about information technology or one of my earlier interests in this place, recycling. I took on a personal interest in agriculture and veterinary chemicals to find that the Australian authority as far as what ought to be done was sitting next to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John is a person who lives his commitment to subjects, whether they be the ones that have been mentioned in a quite lengthy way here tonight or whether they be the ones that we do not know much detail about. Here is the man who uses fuel efficiency as his criteria for selection of his DAS car that he is going to lease. I wonder how many others use that as their criteria. He argues that the tax regime ought to be reorganised as far as automotive taxation is concerned. He argues and lives that. That is the criteria that he uses. I admire that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John will be remembered by those who have tried many times in Australia to advance the fledgling motor fuel industry based on ethanol. It is John who must be remembered for the contribution that he brought to that, for his passion and deep understanding of the real advantages to be gained from encouraging that fledgling industry to develop and for being able to follow it through through the budget negotiations to the stage where we should now be able to correct, after the government recognises the wisdom of the amendments that he proposed some years ago, and finally get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much detail that I could repeat here that other people have raised. But I remind the Senate that it was John Coulter's instinctive knowledge, passion and researched knowledge which enabled him, with the environmental problem which scourged much of our Australian waters earlier this year with the death of pilchards, to bring instinct, research and science to suggest what the cause was and to pursue that cause and to be vindicated in the end for demonstrating that, if only he had been listened to a little earlier, we might have been able to resolve that problem earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by saying that I think that is typical of the contribution that John has made, both at a personal level to me and at a level in public life. If only we were able to pay some attention to the sorts of things he raises; there are problems which confront us that I am sure John Coulter would be able to assist us in resolving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John, I farewell you from this place with a genuine feeling of sadness because I now know you as a friend, after having been introduced to you as an expert.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Peter Cook: it was very pleasing to know that there might have been an influence going back into the 1970s through your family in relation to work that I had done in the environment movement long before I got into this place. I remind the Senate that I was at the university in the late 1940s with Bob Hawke and, believe it or not, we were both members of the student Christian movement at the time. Although John Woodley mentioned my lack of theistic attachment at the moment, that was not always the case. While Bob Hawke and I took somewhat different paths, we both lost our belief in God. Nonetheless, as John Woodley reminded me, I have retained a very strong ethical and moral commitment to those issues that I feel are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all those others who have spoken in various ways. In my prepared speech I would like to pick up some of the points which have been made. Let me begin with this prepared speech. </PARA>

<PARA>I grew up with Kipling's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">If</EMPHASIS> framed on the wall of my bedroom. Little did my mother suspect, nor I know, that the last years of my working life would be spent in an environment in which those qualities would be so needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My mother died before I was elected into the Senate but she always wanted a son to be a doctor. When I spent most of my life in medical research I know very well that she did not approve of that, and I am sure that she would have approved even less of the time that I have spent after entering party political life. But it was, indeed, a natural progression for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I did not join a political party until 1980, I had been politically very active at all levels of the conservation movement since the mid 1950s. Just as with party political activity, this work often separated me from my family for considerable periods of time&mdash;something that several others have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many who criticise those of us who seek a better world for our descendants through political activity. They frequently rail against the travel and perceived perks of office but fail to recognise the costs borne by the families of political activists in the pursuit of a better world. I think Senator Ferguson mentioned spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to thank my family for their forbearance over many years and their understanding and support of what it was that I thought was so important that it took me away from them at many critical times. My two children, Peter and Kiersten, put up with a lot when they were very young in the 1960s. It is hard to believe now that in the 1960s each time I appeared on television speaking on a conservation matter my son would be criticised by his peers next day at school because of the views of his father. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time not a single government in this country had a department of environment. The views I then expressed are now common place, although still not accepted or acted upon by governments. But every government has a department of environment, although none accords it the central place in decision making that it deserves. We still have a very long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My wife, Phyllis, who is here tonight knew what she was letting herself into in marrying someone so committed to change through political activity, for she was warned by her best friend who said to her, `Don't do it.' Phyllis has given me constant and untiring support without which I could not have carried out my function as a senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not news to any of my Senate colleagues, but I say these things to put on the record the enormous support, effort and sacrifice made by both male and female spouses. My time away from home on parliamentary business would be fairly typical of every other senator. In eight years I estimate that I have spent five years away from home on parliamentary business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is much easier to run a line that the perks are what attracts people to politics. In office it is impossible for politicians to say how much pay they get, but as I am about to leave let me say that, calculated at standard rates for 36 1/2 hours and time and a half for overtime, a senator's base pay at present is the equivalent of just under $29,000 per year. This is far below my former income as a research scientist and would be far below the income that most well-qualified people are paid outside parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been served by a marvellous staff. Merilyn Pedrick has been with me for most of my term in the Senate. She has been a source of sunlight and constant good humour in every office that I have occupied. No-one could wish for a better key person holding the whole office together with her always pleasant manner. I will miss my daily contact with Merilyn very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was Leader of the Democrats, I had on my staff a number of excellent researchers, to whom I would like to pay tribute: Richard Bolt, with a sound science background and an ability to get on top of those complex matters very quickly and with considerable insight and clarity of understanding and expression; Imogen Zethoven, with a total dedication to environmental sustainability combined with a grasp of an incredible range of detail on environmental issues; Jacqui Flitcroft, an extremely able person with a very sound perspective and incredible technical skill and able and willing to work under extreme pressure for long hours without crumpling; Isobel Mayer, who worked on Aboriginal issues and industrial relations with equal facility, grasp and dedication; Chris Fry, with his remarkable memory of tax and related legislative detail and with an innovative approach to amendments in this area; and Natasha Stott Despoja, to whom I shall return in a moment. These researchers formed a close-knit and remarkable team. I thank them again for the support that they gave me and to the whole Senate team while I was leader. All save Jacqui Flitcroft have now gone to other jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kym Winter Dewhirst has produced my magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canopy</EMPHASIS> and has been a whiz at media releases which compel reading. To Kym I owe a special debt for mastering the complexities of desktop publishing and producing quality material for my office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without exception, I found all the staff of Parliament House always helpful and hardworking, going beyond what could reasonably be expected to serve the functioning of the parliament. Those who organise our transport, the Clerk of the Senate and his staff, the secretaries and researchers of the Senate committees and the staff of the library have all created a particularly happy and helpful working environment. I shall be here tomorrow clearing up my office, and I hope to get about and say a more personal thankyou to many of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to Natasha Stott Despoja: she was one of over 60 applicants for a job when I became leader of the party. At that stage she was only 21; but even then she stood out above most others, some with better paper qualifications. She was on my staff for several years, was then on Senator Kernot's staff for several years and has been back on my staff for another year. The confidence I placed in her five years ago has been amply justified, and I am delighted that the membership of the South Australian division of the Australian Democrats voted overwhelmingly for Natasha to be the senator to assume the vacancy I will shortly create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that senators and other parliamentarians from both the larger parties have had their eyes on Natasha&mdash;and there is at least one in this chamber tonight&mdash;and have expressed eagerness to have her should she be willing to join their ranks. So I know she will prove to be a great senator, and I am extremely pleased at the prospect of my position being filled by such an exceptional young and talented person. I hope her entry into this chamber will be made before the end of this session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just picking up on this theme of young people&mdash;and I thank Senator Chamarette for her notice of motion today&mdash;Australia needs its gifted young people from a wide range of educational backgrounds in its parliaments, especially its federal parliament. Not surprisingly, some young people are some of the most disillusioned with the political process. Disillusionment catalyses disillusionment through discouraging quality entrants into our parliament. It is a dangerous trend, and it is already well under way. I believe we must all do more to remove the impediments in the way of our gifted young entering a political carer. I hope that Natasha's appointment and next year her election to the Senate will assist the reversal of this trend of disillusionment and mediocrity in political life in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My Democrat parliamentary colleagues have been a small team throughout my time in the Senate, but I believe we have discharged our responsibility to the people of Australia with care and concern for the three broad principles that underpin all Democrat policy: ecological sustainability, social justice and equity and democratic process. We have had our differences but in the Democrats we have a conscience vote on every issue. This is one of the prime reasons I joined the Democrats and not either the Labor or coalition parties. I am picking up here on what Senator Baden Teague said this evening. To me it is fundamental to the proper fulfilment of representative democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People of good conscience, having argued all the pros and cons, can still hold different views and should be judged by the people they represent by those views. People of good conscience who represent constituents should not hide behind the views often held by a slim majority in their party room. Many of you in the Labor and coalition parties will have been discomforted from time to time by divisions that I have called when I have known your private views. I have done this quite deliberately for I have known that many of you did not share the view of your spokesperson or your party on a particular matter. I believe loyalty to party above conscience is a travesty of the notion of representative democracy and is another matter which brings the present parliamentary process into disrepute with so many voters. There have been a number of occasions on which I have voted differently from my parliamentary colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary of my eight years in the Senate, I make two points. Firstly, because of my activity through the conservation movement and in various educational capacities through several decades, those who elected me&mdash;and this I think has been borne out by the speeches tonight&mdash;knew the values I would carry to this office. I believe I have continued to espouse those values and to hold true to those values and therefore discharge my responsibility to the electors of South Australia as a representative of those values. Secondly&mdash;and several people have presaged this tonight&mdash;as regards moving the juggernaut of government closer to the adoption of those values and the implementation of them, I must confess to being an almost total failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I entered the Senate and made my first speech&mdash;they were still called maiden speeches at that stage&mdash;I outlined, and I think this was also mentioned earlier tonight, the failure of presently used economic indexes to measure the right things, the inclusion of costs as benefits in the measurement of GDP, for example&mdash;I will not go into this now, but some time I must take Senator Baden Teague aside and explain in simple terms what I mean by that&mdash;and the absence of a national capital account which gives a totally misleading impression of becoming richer by squandering natural capital and turning it into cash, cash which is then frittered away without turning it back into capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed to the way in which these distorted indexes were seriously misleading and to the way in which the correction of these distortions would indicate different and more reliable paths to be followed, the paths toward ecological sustainability and a more humane society. After the speech, Fred Chaney, who was the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate at that time, came over to me with his congratulations, which as you all know is usual, and said, `A most unusual maiden speech. I don't think I understood it, but if I had I think I would have disagreed with it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing has changed. We still hear all our senior ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), daily, talk about sustainable economic growth, without realising that that term is an oxymoron to beat all oxymorons. Growth, as growth of GDP, is measured exponentially. Sustainability refers to ecological sustainability and the ecology of the planet is finite. It is quite simply proven that economic growth can only continue at the expense of either the environment or equity between people. Either way economic growth is not sustainable. But then whoever noticed economists or ministers wedded to the ideology of economic rationalism looking at the empirical evidence. To the rationalist economist the real world is a special case. Ignoring the real and empirical, we are destined to make the same mistakes over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There's the story of the Prime Minister, the deputy and the Treasurer hiring a light plane to go kangaroo shooting one weekend. Before the plane took off the pilot explained that it was only a small plane and that they could only bring back one large kangaroo. Come Sunday afternoon each minister has shot a large kangaroo and they prevail upon the pilot to load all three. The plane limps into the air and then crashes. The Prime Minister struggles out of the wreckage saying, `Where, where are we?' The Treasurer then fights his way out of the debris and says, `About 100 metres from where we were last year!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic commentators and journalists compound the problem by lack of publicly expressed alternative analyses. By and large, they have accepted economic rationalist language and analysis without looking independently at the empirical evidence. How many television interviews have you seen in which the discussion is centred on the rate of economic growth required to reduce unemployment by a certain percentage? On this, the empirical evidence is clear. There is no relation whatsoever between the rate of economic growth and the reduction in the rate of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give you a few figures: between 1970 and 1992 the US had a 76 per cent growth of GDP and a 45 per cent growth in employment. While France had a 75 per cent growth of GDP, almost identical to the United States, it had only a seven per cent growth in employment. Spain had the second highest economic growth of GDP of all European countries at 93 per cent, but employment actually fell by two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most depressing aspects of the economic debate is that most of the journalists who interview and write about these matters have become enmeshed in the same false paradigm that guides government policy. Only last week I watched in growing anger an interview by Paul Lyneham with the federal Treasurer (Mr Willis) about the percentage point differences that the economy would need to grow to achieve certain employment benefits. I wanted to scream at Paul Lyneham, `Tell the Treasurer it's all a load of cow manure. Present him with some data from the real world.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sorry situation when most of our commentators have adopted the same unreal economic model and use the language and concepts of this false model. There is little analysis that starts from the real and the empirical, and none it seems in the advice which goes to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic rationalist has no clothes. Unfortunately, we are still at the stage at which very few are pointing to his nakedness. Most, with far more vivid imagination than I, still clothe the rationalist emperor in golden raiment and bow down before him. Question: how many economic rationalists does it take to change a light globe? Answer: none, if the light globe needed changing market forces would already have done it. Alternatively, question: how many economic rationalists does it take to change a light globe? Answer: none; see, it's getting brighter. It's really getting brighter, isn't it? See. Don't you believe it's getting brighter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my first speech I also pointed to the dehumanising force of this economic rationalist model. That also has not changed. We are still headed in the wrong direction. We are still in the process of turning market economies into market societies in which every transaction, every act of social intercourse, must take place within the nexus of cash and of self-interested individualism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dominance of economic rationalism within government policy also guarantees that Australia has failed to turn towards ecological sustainability. We are still among the world's worst greenhouse gas polluters and the policies now being put in place will do nothing to alter that situation. As we heard today from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), and as has been mentioned again this evening, the deliberations which concluded in the APEC agreement just signed took no account of environmental considerations. Yet by 2010 we shall certainly be in a period of climate change. Governments around the world will be taking urgent action, and the context for trade will be totally different from today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A solar hot water service on the roof of every house in this country would meet our 20 per cent reduction target and at the same time give us a magnificent manufacturing base to make a big difference in the countries to our north. What the government has done in this very simple example is paltry and tokenistic compared with what could and should be done. Again I disagree entirely with Senator Baden Teague. It is not a matter of going back to living in caves. There is a lot of very exciting science and technology which we are not properly developing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We continue to lose topsoil to erosion faster than natural processes can replace it. Salinisation continues to spread. Pollution of our water courses continues apace and rare and endangered species become rarer and more endangered. Yet government ignorance assumes that we will continue to increase agricultural production. Not only is scientific advice being ignored, but the scientific effort required to understand these threatening processes and methods for their reversal is also being steadily undermined, as is our basic science research effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports of the ESD working group set up under the Hawke government are gathering dust, its recommendations ignored and, in many cases, actively and deliberately impeded. The Business Council of Australia, for instance, describes greenhouse as a myth and the government acts as though the Business Council is a better source of advice than the 200 scientists who advise the intergovernmental panel on climate change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pick up on something that Senator Harradine said. No person, no group, no political party has any understanding of or commitment to sustainability unless it or they develop a population policy. The population size is one half of the equation describing the human impact on the environment. Only the Democrats, among the Australian political parties, has a population policy; and it is built squarely on the principle of ecological sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has once quite specifically rejected a recommendation to develop a population policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some minor successes, such as the $36 million for fuel ethanol which my colleague Senator Bell mentioned earlier. That is $36 million for research from the bounty in that area. This work has the potential to provide renewable fuel for transport, to give Australia a new and economically very profitable lead in this area and to save Australia an enormous import bill for petroleum, as well as very substantially reducing the pollution from oil consumption. But these successes aside, the broad picture is that Australia is still heading in the wrong direction, destroying the environment of our descendants and dissipating the natural wealth of our country in unsustainable ways. </PARA>

These gases, as well as the secondary pollutants they create, for example ground level ozone, are subject to ambient air quality guidelines promulgated by the National Health and Medical Research Council and by agencies such as the World Health Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The controls on vehicle emissions contained in ADR 37/01 are intended to ensure that ambient air standards for criteria pollutants are maintained within the standards adopted by State environment agencies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Employment is only one of the issues under consideration to protect Reserve's interests on call out, but is one of the most important. A draft discussion paper has been passed to the Department of Industrial Relations, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for comment.
