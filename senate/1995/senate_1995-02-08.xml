<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The 15th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation examines the track record of the superannuation guarantee system, which commenced in 1992. In this inquiry, the Select Committee on Superannuation received evidence on the general level of acceptance of the superannuation guarantee by employees and employers, areas of contention, areas of inadequacy and areas where improvement needs to be made. The committee also scrutinised the 28 June statement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus of the report is on what has become known as the small amounts problem. This is the situation where small superannuation accounts are eroded in a short period by fees, charges and taxation. The employer in the situation feels that it has wasted its time and money and the employee is left with little or no superannuation. I would not have to outline to any of you the nature of the problem, as I am sure that all of you would have received many constituents' complaints upon this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has formulated a package of measures that it believes will alleviate the reduction of small amounts superannuation accounts. This package has been formulated in anticipation of the member protection and the transfer protocols announced by the Treasurer last June. None of the three recommendations that comprise this package concerning the small amounts problems actually should be considered in isolation. They stand together, balancing the concerns of the range of people and the groups that came before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the committee has recommended, first, that consideration should be given to changing the superannuation guarantee threshold from $450 per month to a quarterly figure of less than $1,350. A move to an essentially lower dollar threshold will broaden the superannuation guarantee net, will move in the direction of removing inconsistencies between superannuation guarantee and the award super, and will decrease the administrative burden that processing superannuation guarantee for short-term, casual workers, such as backpackers doing a month's fruit picking, places upon employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are included in the superannuation guarantee system because of this measure will be the permanent part-time or permanent casual type of worker who should not be excluded from the nation's retirement income system because of the part-time nature of their work. On a rough calculation, a person who earns $445 per month for 40 years from the year 2002 would have approximately $20,000 of contributions made on their behalf&mdash;without escalation. Although this will not provide a retirement income for the remainder of their life, it is a significant sum to be denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, for those to whom the superannuation guarantee would be extended under this measure, there is the possibility of creating further small accounts. It is for this reason that the measure cannot be taken in isolation; it must be viewed in light of the total package of recommendations of the committee, and in light of the member protection requirements and the imminent transfer protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of the committee's package is the removal of access to balances of under $500. By changing the threshold to include more part-time low income workers in the manner I have just outlined, more small balances will be created. However, the committee sees little use in extending the superannuation guarantee coverage to permanent part-time type workers if the superannuation accumulated is merely withdrawn at a point somewhere before the $500 mark. Again, this cannot stand alone, as the experience to date of small balance holders has been the erosion of their contributions. The member protection rules and transfer protocol are integral to the viability of this recommendation. So too is the third element of the committee's package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element of the package is some tax relief for small balance superannuation accounts. Contributions tax on the first $500 should be removed. The government has required funds to protect small balances under the member protection rules. The government itself should also contribute to the conservation of small balances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anecdotally, the committee has heard that this would not be simple. Most tax issues are not. The government, in consultation with the industry, should be able to find the means to protect the superannuation from a higher than marginal tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this package of measures to the chamber. I ask honourable senators to apply it to a few of the scenarios that they have received from constituents. I think, in undertaking that exercise, it will become very clear that this package of measures will enhance the effective operation of the superannuation guarantee system and promote the long-term goals of retirement incomes on all sides of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now briefly convey to you the committee's other findings and recommendations. The committee looked at the factors that contribute to small amounts. It was in this area of its inquiry that the committee heard from many ordinary Australians whose so-called nest egg&mdash;albeit a small amount&mdash;has disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of interest to many of you will be the table in the report that details the effect that fees, charges and tax has had on these people's small superannuation amounts. In this context the committee scrutinised the Treasurer's proposals and concluded that, whilst the ATO scheme will provide one facet of the solution to the small amounts problem, its role is a specific one: the ATO scheme should be limited to those employers unable to find appropriate funds offering member protection or unable to use existing employee accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises the importance of the transfer protocol in eliminating the small amounts problem. It has therefore recommended that the government ensure that appropriate transfer protocols be adopted by all participating funds. It also supports the extended use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes&mdash;again, subject to member consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A group adversely affected by the superannuation guarantee is some non-resident workers who generate relatively small amounts of superannuation guarantee whilst on contract in Australia and meanwhile lose certain superannuation advantages in their country of residence. The committee has recommended that exemptions to non-resident workers be extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large volume of evidence was received on the interaction, or lack of interaction, between the superannuation guarantee and the award superannuation systems. This causes grief for all parties: employers, employees, fund administrators. It is imperative that, if superannuation is to be accepted by the community, the inconsistencies between these two systems be removed. The industrial parties must all work to this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason the committee recommends that the government be proactive in seeking uniformity by submitting to the review of awards currently being undertaken by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The government's submission should outline the means by which the inconsistencies can eventually be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the committee continues its keen pursuit of consumer education. It calls on the government to maintain the education programs and target them appropriately. The committee has identified one means by which information on superannuation guarantee requirements can be propagated to small business in particular, and that is via the BizHelp software package that was launched by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) in November last. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take this opportunity of commending to you the very hard work by all of my five colleagues on the committee&mdash;in particular, my deputy, Senator Sue West, who has taken a very keen interest in this whole matter. Senator Chris Evans from Western Australia has a deep knowledge of superannuation arising from his involvement in superannuation through the union movement, and I value his support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bruce Childs has an abiding interest in low paid workers and is determined to assist in getting superannuation to benefit such people. Senator John Woodley from the Australian Democrats was relatively new to the committee but has shown commendable interest and introduced a number of issues which the committee has taken on board, and I thank him. Last but not least, my colleague Senator Ferguson, who has come from the industry, has some extensive knowledge, and I value his loyalty, support and the technical contributions that he makes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the committee secretariat, headed by Ms Krista Gerrard, for their dedication, for the amount of extra duty that is involved in a very busy committee and for responding to the literally hundreds or thousands of letters that we receive on these important issues. The committee is an important one for the Senate, and I thank all those who have participated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address some remarks to the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation. Perhaps I ought to start on the note that the chairman concluded on by thanking the chairman, the members of the committee and the staff for the work that they put into the report. It is the most constructive committee that I serve on in this parliament, and this report reflects that constructive approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that, on this occasion, there is some disagreement among the members&mdash;small as that may be&mdash;within the text of the report, but I think the committee has had the maturity to deal with some different approaches to the issue while still continuing the good work started by my colleague Senator Sherry. He brought a constructive and intelligent approach to the committee's work and really contributed to the superannuation debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see this report as an endorsement of the superannuation guarantee scheme. There has been a lot of criticism directed at some of the problems associated with the introduction of the superannuation guarantee and superannuation generally, but the spread of the benefit of superannuation throughout the work force is one of the great achievements of this Labor government. This report essentially endorses the policy that has been pursued, and it endorses the approach soon to be taken by the government in introducing the tax office mechanism for the collection of small amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that that legislation will be introduced into the Senate shortly, and I think it will be a useful addition to the legislation which seeks to regulate the superannuation system in Australia. That legislation will deal with a number of the problems that the committee has been made aware of in its hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are extremely concerned about the criticisms and the evidence given to the committee about the erosion of small amounts. It is fundamental to the success of the system of superannuation in this country that young people, and people generally, do not see their contributions to superannuation eaten away by fees, charges and taxation. You cannot expect people to feel positive about a system if, for instance, $100 of their money per annum goes into a superannuation fund, and they find that at the end of the year there is $1 or $2 left once all the charges, taxes, et cetera have been taken out of their fund. That problem must be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made some constructive suggestions to build on the government's proposals for member protection rules and the ATO mechanism to make sure that we get that right. I think it is absolutely essential that we deal with those problems because they are undermining support for superannuation and undermining people's confidence in the system, and quite rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Australian Taxation Office mechanism proposed by the government is necessary, but, hopefully, not for too long. I think gradually superannuation funds are beginning to be more responsive to the need to cater for the lower end of the market&mdash;those people with small amounts and those people who have low paid jobs or a number of part-time or casual jobs. I think gradually superannuation funds are responding to that need, but they continually have to be driven by the parliament and the government to be responsive. Some of the recommendations we have made in this report seek to drive them along that path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation funds have been granted an advantage in that they have access to these funds virtually exclusively. This report supports that policy. Certainly from the government members' point of view, we have opposed the extension of superannuation accounts to banks and credit unions on the basis that we do not think that that would benefit the system but rather would add to the complexity. To be quite honest, we believe the banks have shown by their recent decisions in relation to transaction fees for accounts with small balances that they are not really serious about wanting to get involved in the problem area of superannuation, which is those accounts with small balances and the accounts of people on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence of what has occurred in the last year or so in relation to transaction fees in the banking area really blows out of the water the argument that somehow the involvement of the banks is going to improve the situation. I think the government's proposal to introduce member protection rules is sound. I would hope that eventually those rules will be all that is necessary, but I think in the short term the ATO mechanism for the collection of small amounts will probably be required. I am anxious that the government introduce that legislation as soon as possible to protect those small amounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also looked at the question of whether or not there should be some taxation relief for small accounts or for those persons who maintain small balances. I think the recommendations in the report are a little stronger than I would have wanted, but they flag the problem that it is not purely charges and fees imposed by the superannuation funds that eat away at balances. It is, in fact, the tax on contributions as well which makes a significant contribution to the erosion of small amounts. A very plausible argument can be made that the taxation on superannuation, for low income earners in particular, is at a higher marginal rate than that which is normally applied to their income because of the 15 per cent contributions tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people so affected would not be paying any tax at all or would be paying very low marginal rates if it was treated as income. I think there is an argument for looking at that problem. The harsh reality is that, even if you remove all fees and charges imposed by superannuation funds, small amounts will continue to be eaten away by taxation. It will not be to the same degree, but it will continue to constitute a problem. This report flags to the government that it needs to look at that area as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our other recommendations&mdash;and I will not go into the detail of many of them&mdash;really go to the committee's philosophy&mdash;it is certainly my philosophy&mdash;that underlines this report: that is, that while the superannuation system has some problems, those problems can be fixed; the system can be made to work effectively for low paid workers, workers in casual employment and people who come in and out of the work force; and it is not beyond our wit to make it work. We have supported the changes the government is proposing and we have proposed some additional changes that we believe will make the system work better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not support the principle that low paid workers should somehow be excluded from the net of the superannuation guarantee or from superannuation generally in this country. People will never be able to rise above the disadvantages of being low paid or in casual employment if they are excluded in that way. My attitude is to support the principle that every dollar earned ought to be assessed for superannuation purposes and that contributions ought to be retained in superannuation accounts. The challenge for us is to make sure that that money is protected, that it grows and contributes to people's superannuation and their retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So our challenge is not to try to find some way of excluding those people from the superannuation system but to make sure that it works for them and that the money they put in is protected and they have a chance to benefit from that contribution. This is preferable to trying to strike some arbitrary line in the sand that says, `These people are excluded; they are not entitled to superannuation' or `They are too disadvantaged currently to be able to contribute to superannuation.' The fact is no-one will accumulate large amounts in a superannuation account without starting with a small amount. The reality of working life is that people move between income levels, between part-time and full-time employment, between casual and full-time employment. The current reality is that people over their working lives have a variety of experiences in the employment context. What we have to do&mdash;and this is the subject of an inquiry the committee is commencing&mdash;is make sure the system is much more adaptable to those with different working patterns to the traditional male 40-year working pattern. We have to be much more conscious of the needs of women workers, in particular. Hopefully, the committee will add to that debate in its next major report. I commend the report to the Senate and again thank all committee members for their efforts. </PARA>

The first thing I want to do is return the compliment from the chair of this committee, Senator Watson, and to say that, of all the committees in this parliament that I have been on, I have not yet been on a committee which has had such a fair chair. Other committee chairs, I must admit, have done an excellent job but this particular chair not only commends his own position in the Senate but also the position of the party that he is part of and is a credit to the Senate itself. I am not saying that simply to scratch backs because mine has been scratched; I really believe that.

So I return the compliment, Senator Watson. You have been an excellent chair of this committee. Part of the credibility of the committee is due to the quality of the committee and certainly to that of the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to add my thanks to the staff, who are really quite remarkable in the amount of work they do, in the ability they have to get on top of the various issues which are canvassed and also to know the subject, particularly Krista Gerrard. Her grasp of superannuation is quite remarkable. I would like to add my thanks to those of the chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of outstanding issues for the Democrats which later I will speak more about. One of them is the whole issue of a contributions tax. Although we have gone some way, at least in the first instance, to giving a one-off discount of $500 for this, nevertheless in continuing years those people on an income of, say, $6,150, which is the tax-free threshold, once the super is fully implemented at nine per cent, would attract a super guarantee charge of about $550 a year, which would attract a contributions tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are great administrative difficulties in what I am suggesting. But the principle that a person who pays no tax on their income should pay tax on their superannuation contribution is a bad principle. I do not know how we would fix it. But I signal that the Democrats still have some problems with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue which I admit would be an administrative nightmare, particularly for employers, but which would solve a lot of our problems is member choice. In other words, employees would have the choice of superannuation funds. Obviously, the committee could not recommend that. But I signal that in the end that would, at least from the employees' point of view, be a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge what Senator Chris Evans said about superannuation savings accounts, particularly in relation to the banks. In the report, the coalition and the Democrats have proposed a framework for superannuation savings accounts which I believe would enable at least some of the financial institutions to come up with a proposal within that framework. I suspect that only the credit unions and building societies would be able to fulfil those conditions. But I believe that if they are able to fulfil the very tight framework that we have proposed they ought to be allowed to compete in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concur with what Senator Evans said about the banks, but other financial institutions could offer a product that would be very helpful in solving this small savings account problem. I need to place on the record that I do not think it is totally solved by the government's proposal for collection through the Australian Taxation Office. With those few remarks, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this special year of Remembrance of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, it is my great honour to introduce into this Parliament a bill providing for Anzac Day to continue to be observed on 25 April each year and to declare Anzac Day as the National Day of Commemoration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of the bill is to ensure that, for current and future generations of Australians, the contribution of all those who served Australia in time of war is commemorated and remembered, so that Anzac Day will continue to hold an important and special place in the hearts and minds of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The significance of Anzac Day in forging Australia's national identity in a very special way is known to us all. It is timely, however, to recall the legacy of Anzac and what it symbolises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One newspaper editorial of the time described the meaning of the achievement of Anzac in the following terms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the Anzacs astonished the watching nations, our national sentiment was of a flabby and sprawling character. We were Australians in name. . . but we had been taught by our politicians not to trust ourselves&mdash;we were constantly admonished by our daily journals to remember that we were nothing better than a joint in the tail of a great Empire. There were patriots who protested against [this] slavish and sycophantic doctrine. But, generally speaking, it was assumed that Australia only lived by the grace of England, and the Empire Day orators had a better hearing than the faithful souls who clung to Australia Day and gave special honour to their own starry banner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anzac day has changed all that. . . .  No matter how the war may end&mdash;and it can only end in one way&mdash;we are at last a nation, with one heart, one soul, and one thrilling aspiration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no doubt that the Anzac achievement signalled the fulfilment of the promise of Nationhood in the fledgling Australian Federation. The deeds of Australian soldiers at Anzac gave birth to a belief in the capacity of all Australians to attain for themselves a uniquely independent and proud national identity. The Anzac tradition embodied a true sense of National character. For the first time, it set Australia and Australians apart by demonstrating their willingness and capacity to have Australia's voice heard in its own right in the community of nations of which it was a part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no question either that the Anzac tradition is the unifying symbol of the sacrifice made by Australian servicemen and women. Nor is there any doubt about its subsequent influence on later generations of Australians who continue to uphold that tradition. The willingness to meet this sacrifice instilled in Australians a sense of pride in themselves and their achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill ensures that, as time slips by,  the courage, fortitude and selfless sacrifice of the Anzacs and those who followed them, will not be forgotten, but remembered in a special way. By declaring Anzac Day as the National Day of Commemoration to be observed on 25 April each year, their deeds, and those of all Australian servicemen and women and others who have served the nation in time of war, will not only be remembered and commemorated, but serve as an ideal which will inspire and guide future generations of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am mindful also that, in focusing attention on the significance of commemoration and remembrance, the tragic aftermath of war should not be forgotten. In this sense, I believe that this bill symbolises the debt owed by the nation to those whose lives were affected by war. It is, therefore, a timely reminder of the continuing commitment of the Australian Government to honour and serve veterans and their war widows through programs of care, compensation and commemoration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will remind honourable senators and the audience what the Senate is now doing. The Senate is considering a motion by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, to exempt the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) from the order of the Senate which was adopted on 29 November 1994. This bill has caused considerable controversy amongst the people who have had a chance to look at it. People have had a chance to look at this bill since only Thursday of last week. From memory, that is when the bill was introduced into the chamber. The bill seeks to do certain things. It seeks to give retrospective effect to the regulations which made the People's Republic of China a safe third country for the refugees in question. Notwithstanding that, after 15 years their concern is not about the persecution they suffered at the hands of the Vietnamese authorities but about what they are allegedly suffering at the hands of the PRC authorities. The order of the Senate of 29 November 1994 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the reasons set out in this resolution, where, during a period of sittings, a bill is first introduced into the Senate by a minister or received from the House of Representatives, and a motion is moved for the second reading of the Bill, debate on that motion shall be adjourned at the conclusion of the speech of the Senator moving the motion and resumption of the debate shall be made an order of the day for the first day of sitting in the next period of sittings without any question being put.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the principle of a bill being introduced one session and debated the next. That is what Senator Gareth Evans said would be the approach of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a proper way of doing things. It not only allows us to get across the legislation and its implications, and to consult with the community, but also allows the community itself and those specifically affected by the legislation to have their say. Thus it allows us to exercise our representative function in the way that we should be exercising it. It is a principle of a bill being introduced one session and debated the next so that proper time is allowed for that purpose, not introduced one week and debated the next, as is the case with this particular bill. It was introduced on Thursday of last week and now we are expected to debate it on Wednesday of this week. The order of the Senate continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where the Government wishes the Senate to depart from that general chronological priority, the Government should justify each such departure in debate which concludes with a resolution of agreement by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that this is the very first occasion that the government has sought to depart from the general principle. That is another reason why we have to test it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the minister do? He put forward a certain justification. Last night he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were the Senate not to deal with this bill until the next session, a number of the recent arrivals who have lodged refugee claims since my announcement of 30 December would be able to pursue those claims, notwithstanding the fact that they had already been granted protection by the People's Republic of China and had already been put on notice of the government's intention that the safe third country provisions should apply to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the processing and implementation of the agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is to say, the agreement between the Australian government and the PRC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that this legislation pass at this particular stage.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all he said. That is no justification at all for providing the type of exemption that the minister seeks. In particular, might I say pointedly, it is no justification for the matter to be debated only three sitting days since it was introduced. At least the minister might have come in here and said we will have this debate when we come back after having been two weeks in the electorate and debate it at perhaps the end of this month or the beginning of next month. But, no, he is trying to force it through today. That is another reason why I am right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may have been another matter had the minister made out a case for having the bill perhaps dealt with next month rather than three days after it had been introduced. That sort of activity is obscene. In fact, that was referred to time and again by the people who heard about this particular legislation and who rushed to give evidence and make submissions to the Legal and Constitutional Committee. First of all, let me read to the Senate what the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, said in respect of the bill that the government is seeking exemption for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will. Sir Ronald Wilson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A related concern is attracted by certain provisions of the No. 2 Bill (for example, s. 4(2)(a)), which reflect a failure to respect the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about this bill! He is talking about this bill! I repeat: `which reflect a failure to respect the rule of law'. He is saying that this bill reflects a failure to respect the rule of law. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of authorising an arbitrary interference with the existing rights of an individual coupled with a denial of any judicial review might be thought to be inconsistent with the fundamental practices and policies of a civilised community.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he was saying. It is quite clear that the minister has not even read, let alone contemplated the implications of, the statement of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, in respect of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are most concerned about the way this particular measure is handled and, indeed, about the way the whole refugee situation is handled by the government. I will not take the time of the Senate to quote all of the evidence that has been given to us, but let me simply indicate that the vast majority of the people who spoke to us were very concerned about this measure and complained to the committee that they had insufficient time to study the total ramifications of the bill. However, they were able to make submissions that the bill should be rejected. The Law Council of Australia, in its submission to the Legal and Constitutional Committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulty with this prescription&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>under statutory rule No. 3 of 1995, which this bill seeks to make retrospective until the announcement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is that the Vietnamese refugees who have arrived in Australia and have been permitted to make applications for refugee status, may be making claims of persecution within the terms of the Convention definition against China rather than against Vietnam. It follows that it is logically and factually difficult to regard China as being a designated safe third country for these asylum seekers. Rather China should be regarded as their country of former habitual residence.</PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly the case. The allegations of persecution which have fallen from the lips of these people who have come to our shores seeking asylum are against China, not against Vietnam. I put them as allegations because I am not here to judge the case. Apparently the government can judge the case and whack in this legislation to deal with the specific concerns of individuals on a group basis. Apparently the government can be judge and jury in the case; but I will not be. The opportunity for these people to have their cases properly adjudicated by the due processes of the law in this country is being taken away by the designation of China as a safe third country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of the Migration Act require the government to table in the parliament an explanation of why the government has designated a particular country as a safe third country. The act requires the minister to address the compliance by the particular country&mdash;in this case, the communist government in China, the PRC&mdash;with relevant international law concerning the protection of Vietnamese refugees settled in the PRC. It also requires the meeting by the PRC of relevant human rights standards for the Vietnamese refugees settled in the PRC and the willingness of the PRC to allow the Vietnamese refugees settled in the PRC who have subsequently travelled illegally to Australia to return to the PRC and to remain there. If you have a look at that you will see that it is pretty well gobbledegook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting in respect of where they deal with human rights. It is accepted that there are gross and continuing violations of human rights in China. I will deal with this matter later because, under standing orders, I cannot really deal with it here. But at some stage or another there will be democracy in the PRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from the document that the minister has tabled in the parliament pursuant to the Migration Act requirements. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the human rights accorded the Vietnamese refugees in China, Australia is satisfied that the refugees are treated essentially as Chinese nationals, and that their living standards are in the main similar to those of local Chinese nationals. We understand that they have the same rights and obligation as Chinese nationals, which includes the obligations under the household registration system and that they enjoy the same civil rights as Chinese nationals&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting statement, isn't it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with the exception of the right to participate in elections.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that has been picked up by anybody, but it is interesting to reflect that the government says that so blandly and designates China as a safe third country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being asked by the government to push this through without giving it the consideration that it deserves. That is what concerns me. We are talking about issues of life and death. They could affect the lives of these people who have made application. They are not all necessarily refugees who went to China after being kicked out of their own country in 1978-79, though this bill says they are in that category. This bill covers not only them but also their close relatives. So this bill could deny refugee status to a person who has come to our shores from the People's Republic of China&mdash;a person who was born in the PRC and never left it&mdash;just because that person happens to be a close relative of the Vietnamese refugee, as classified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being asked to deny the due processes to these people, these individuals, which are required of us by our international obligations under the status of refugee convention and the protocols. That is what we are doing here. It is a very serious question and a very serious issue for our international obligations, and also for our proper consideration of applications for refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not even prepared to allow the due processes of the Senate to be observed. As I was saying last night, the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has not even had time to consider this legislation. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee is charged under our standing orders to report whether bills that come before us, by express words or otherwise:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which, by the way, this bill does because the minister will have a discretionary power to consider refugee applications from this group, but it is a non-compellable discretion and it is not subject to any judicial or independent scrutiny&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)inappropriately delegate legislative powers; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v)insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, what Sir Ronald Wilson was saying was that the bill fell short of that. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee had not even had the opportunity to look at this measure by last night. I understand that the committee, with pressure from its other work, was able to give it some consideration this morning. I understand that that consideration will be included in a report for us to have this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I come back to the point that I made and I ask the minister to listen to this. Thus far, the minister has not given the Senate proper justification for the exemption of this bill from the order of the Senate on 29 November last year, that is to say exemption from the principle that you introduce legislation one session and you debate it the next. Furthermore, the minister has gone further than that. He has introduced legislation one week and we are debating it the next; he introduced it on Thursday and this is the third sitting day since then. That is just obscene when this measure deals with such vitally important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has not even&mdash;and I raise this again&mdash;suggested that we might be able to give this further consideration and perhaps delay it until the end of this month or maybe the beginning of next month, which would give us an opportunity to have further consultations around the community and to look further at the implications of the bill. It is unfair, I believe, for the government to ask us to vote for this motion which will exempt this bill from that particular order and which will not give us the opportunity to properly and maturely examine the bill which we, as representatives of the people, are required to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Senator Harradine has dealt very clearly with the content issues of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) that deserve a much more thorough and detailed analysis before the Senate can responsibly do its job in relation to the legislation. I am going to dwell mainly on the rationale for the original procedural motion and why I believe this bill should not be an exemption from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the history of the procedural motion goes back to 18 August 1993. I introduced a cut-off motion at that time for two reasons. The first reason was that prior to that time we had at the end of each session a very irresponsible log jam of legislation that was simply rushed through from the House of Representatives and pushed through at such a pace by the Senate sitting into the late hours, or early hours I should say, of the final days of the session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really was a shameful abuse of the legitimate powers of the Senate. We have a responsibility to review and scrutinise legislation which is passed to us by the House of Representatives. The Senate has a legitimate view and it cannot do justice to that view if it has 20 or 30 bills to consider, of which it has had no prior notice and which are pushed through. That was the first reason for that cut-off motion&mdash;simply a procedural matter that allowed us to do our jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason was that the government had been taking advantage of that log jam to perpetrate a shameful pushing through of legislation which it knew to be controversial, which it knew to be questionable and which it knew the community had very strong views on that had not had a chance to be expressed or be regarded in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main reason for my proposing that procedural motion in the first place was that I felt it was shameful to be a member of the Senate on 5 May 1992 when, by dint of numbers, migration legislation was pushed from the House of Representatives through the Senate within the space of, I think, five hours to pre-empt an appeal to the High Court, to actually obstruct the judicial access of people within this country. I was absolutely appalled that I had to be part of a debate conducted, I remember well, between Senator Harradine, Senator Coulter, me and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). We demanded to know why that bill was to be rushed through when it was of such dubious validity. As a result of that, detention which could have been found to be illegal and which allowed people some legitimate avenues for concern was made legal from that date, 5 May 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second scandalous example of that kind was on 17 December 1992. Once again it was migration legislation. That bill was to close the loophole that had been provided by legislation rushed through on 5 May 1992. Mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals on our shores was rendered legal only by this parliament and not by the courts. The courts were not given an opportunity to voice a view on that. They actually said that prior to that date there was a period of illegal detention. In December 1992, we passed a bill that said that if any detention prior to May 1992 happened to be illegal, people would be given compensation of a dollar a day. That was a scandalous bill and it has been challenged in the High Court&mdash;quite appropriately so. That is the second occasion. Those two occasions led to my procedural motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 August 1993 we heard an assurance from Senator Gareth Evans that the government thereafter would introduce legislation on an `introduce one session, debate the next' basis. I regret to say that, having been made in August 1993, that assurance was not adhered to in any considerable fashion. In August 1994 we had to reassert that principle and remind Senator Evans of his commitment. As a result of that, we obtained the procedural motion, which is under consideration today, to exempt this particular migration legislation from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind senators of the reason why we should respect that procedural motion. It is not simply that I believe it is an abdication of the responsibility of this chamber, but also that there is a useful purpose. I quote the reasons for this `introduce one session, debate the next' basis from my notice of motion of 10 November 1994. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)there should be an orderly debate of bills in accordance with some general chronological priority based on the principle that bills introduced in one sittings should preferably be debated in the next sittings;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)such a priority reflects and ensures effective use of the time available:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)to Senators to research the implications of the bills, consult the community, prepare speech notes and draft any necessary amendments, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)to the media and the public to become aware of the possible effects of proposed laws . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think this is a very good illustration of why this bill that we are proposing to exempt from that procedural order should not be exempted. It was introduced only on 31 January by Senator Ray. At that point in time it was deferred to the first day of the next sitting, quite appropriately, in accordance with the motion, but it was simultaneously referred by Senator Ray to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It was referred for a reporting date&mdash;which at the time I felt to be unusual and, I might say, suspicious&mdash;which was, I believe, 6 February. Why would we need such a quick reporting date when, quite clearly, a procedural order had been put in place to defer it to the first day of the next sitting? We know, because the minister has been attempting to explain why they want to rush this bill through in the same way they rushed the previous bills through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that there was a moment when the opposition actually demonstrated a progressive view in relation to migration bills. That, sadly, has passed. We were notified yesterday that the opposition's genuine role to challenge the indefensible attitude of this government in relation to asylum seekers has gone. The opposition challenged it last year and it is to be congratulated for making that stand. It is a shameful thing that, because an electoral nerve has been twitched by the government in threatening a double dissolution, the opposition has moved from that stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is one of the problems we have in relation to all these bills. They can be pushed through without adequate scrutiny and debate because the numbers are there when the government and opposition vote together. It leaves 10 members in this chamber&mdash;the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine. Now, of course, it will be 11, hopefully, but I do not know that we can have any assurance of that. Senator Devereux is independent and he can vote in his own right, but it leaves those 10 to consistently maintain the genuine role of opposition to what is a shameful government stance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bill was referred by the government to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The report was tabled yesterday. In fact, it was tabled fractionally ahead of this motion being debated and brought into this chamber. I happen to know, having glanced at that committee report, that there are two minority reports. There is one from Senator Spindler and one from Senator Harradine. I have not had adequate time to read that through, to understand the implications of it towards the debate, and I think it is an insult to this chamber that we are being rushed through once again in relation to that bill when the committee has only just handed down a view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that the committee has been under considerable stress because it has been required to cooperate with a ridiculous timetable. Also, it had to give consideration to Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). The committee had to do that in an extraordinarily short time, which I think is an indefensible thing to ask of honourable senators who participate in those committees. </PARA>

But we, the members of this chamber, cannot do justice to all the hard work that the senators and secretariat have put in because we will not have time to give it due consideration. Because the numbers are here, I believe that, once again, we are about to push this bill through into its second reading stage. I will be speaking on the second reading debate and, at the same time, trying to understand the complexities that were unveiled in the committee's report.

It is irresponsible for senators in this place to go through this as though the existence of a procedural order and the necessity for us to exempt bills&mdash;bills that the government feels it has to rush through for its own personal or business agenda&mdash;is merely a matter of inconvenience, especially when there is a rightful place within the parliament for proper review and scrutiny of those decisions that we are being asked to rubber stamp. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating whether the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 should be dealt with forthwith, thereby making an exception to the procedural motion which the Senate passed which would require that the bill be dealt with in the next session. At one stage I was fairly relaxed about when this bill would be dealt with because, on the face of it, after I examined the provisions of the bill, I was very confident that the Senate would throw it out. I was confident that senators would see the injustice of this particular bill. I thought there probably was some benefit in giving those people&mdash;people who are currently extremely uncertain of their fate because they might be, holus-bolus, as a group, sent back to China, the country they have fled&mdash;quick certainty as to the position the Australian parliament would adopt on this bill, which I believe should be thrown out. I thought the case was fairly clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as the debate developed and the committee&mdash;under considerable difficulties, as has been pointed out by Senators Harradine and Chamarette&mdash;examined the material; and with it becoming apparent that the coalition parties were wavering on this particular issue&mdash;and I still find it difficult to understand how they could do so&mdash;we then heard last night that they are now prepared to pass the bill which previously they characterised as retrospective and chastised as being unjust. They now are prepared to pass it and turn up their bellies to be tickled by the government simply on a procedural matter they perceive to be to their electoral advantage and benefit: to deny the government the possibility of having an early election brought on by a motion for a double dissolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the issue is now one that needs to be examined at much greater length and in much greater detail. Senators in this house as well as community groups outside need more time to make the point that the decision that this parliament is about to make is a low point in Australia's treatment of refugees. Certainly it will be opposed by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will very briefly touch on some of the points that the bill makes. The bill recognises China as a safe third country for the purpose of Sino-Vietnamese people&mdash;and that is a loose definition&mdash;fleeing China. That will mean that these people, as a group, will be sent back to China&mdash;the country from which they have fled&mdash;without the assessment of their refugee status on an individual basis, as required under international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In earlier boatloads&mdash;and I think we should look at what in substance this might mean&mdash;most of the asylum seekers were found to qualify as refugees on the basis that they had a well-founded fear of persecution. Despite the fact that a significant proportion of people on this and subsequent boatloads is likely to reflect a similar proportion&mdash;in other words, there will be people who will fall into the international definition of being a refugee, and that is not denied by the government&mdash;we are prepared to simply say, `Well, that may be so, but we are not going to assess them. We'll send them back as a group, as a boatload. We are going to deny them asylum in Australia because we find it administratively convenient to deal with it that way. We are finding it costly and administratively inconvenient to meet our international obligations and to assess each person's refugee status.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these refugees who have come on previous boatloads&mdash;and there is no reason to suggest that the boatload that has prompted this bill is any different&mdash;were refugees who had been expelled from Vietnam. Once in China, they were denied Chinese nationality and, as a result, they were denied housing registration; in some cases, they were denied adequate food; they were certainly denied education; and they were denied medical services. Most recently, many have had their houses demolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is prepared to send back all such asylum seekers; moreover, it is prepared to do so by retrospective legislation to make sure that we include those people who arrived even before the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) thought of this legislation, let alone announced it by press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, a suggestion by the government that the provision in the bill which gives the minister non-compellable discretion to deal with individual people in that group is sufficient to discharge our obligation under international law to assess each asylum seeker as to whether or not they are a genuine refugee. Let us just look at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, the minister is not obliged to exercise that discretion. Worse than that, the asylum seeker is in a position where he or she does not even know that that avenue is available to them, because all they will be given is a brief identification interview where they will be asked, `Who are you? Where are you from? Why are you here?' It will be entirely up to the discretion of a public servant employed by the immigration department to determine whether a particular case, on the basis of that scant information, should be referred to the minister for the possible exercise of the minister's discretion. I might add that, even if that happened, there is no judicial review of the way in which the minister exercises that discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of how immigration department officials have dealt with refugees in the past and the lengthy legal wrangling that was gone into to enable the refugees to achieve at least a modicum of fairness in the assessment of their status, one must say that one cannot have a great deal of confidence that any of these refugees will be advised clearly by the immigration department officials that this avenue of discretion by the minister exists and what they should do to access it. The bill is silent on providing any access to this particular avenue which might be the last life raft that is offered to them. Basically, the bill simply says, apart from this one inadequate exception, that we are going to send them back in one boat load and we are not going to bother to consider their individual circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position that has been foreshadowed by the coalition parties to ignore this extremely rough treatment that we are prepared to mete out to refugees who reach our shores is extremely disappointing. I think we need to point out that these are Vietnamese and Chinese refugees. For some reason we seem to be prepared to treat them willy-nilly in this particular way. I wonder whether the position of the government and the coalition would be different if we were dealing with a boat load of refugees from the UK. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a point that should not escape the notice of this house. We have had evidence of extreme concern amongst the Vietnamese and Chinese communities expressed to the committee. We have had evidence of concern from organisations like FECCA, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils, that are concerned about what they see as the discriminatory treatment that is meted out to these refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all these reasons, the Australian Democrats believe that it is inappropriate indeed to rush this bill through the Senate today&mdash;and may I add my personal view&mdash;at a time when the opposition is apparently prepared to forsake principle for what it perceives to be electoral advantage, as demonstrated last night when it said that it is now prepared to pass a bill which last year it characterised as a bill that should not be passed because of its `totally retrospective character'. The opposition has also quoted objections raised by the Law Council of Australia. It has taken a very firm view in words, but, unfortunately, this is not followed by deeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the coalition parties, if no-one else, should be given another chance to examine the evidence. They should be given another opportunity to examine the material that advocates of the refugee organisations have placed before us and can still place before us. They all said at the proceedings of the committee inquiry that they have had inadequate time to prepare their cases. I believe it is unseemly and contrary to good parliamentary practice for the government to try to rush this bill through today and for the coalition parties to support the government, if they do. I hope they do not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate relates to whether the Senate order of 29 November 1994, which allows for the exemption of its application, should be permitted in this case. So it is a procedural debate. I will not go into the substance of the bill as some of the other contributors to this debate have done because I think the appropriate time for that is the second reading debate on the bill, which we will presumably come to next.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in this Senate chamber is more concerned with the need for proper, due process than I. The coalition has scrupulously observed and called for due process in the handling of Senate proceedings and parliamentary proceedings for a long time. Indeed, one of the basic and major criticisms the coalition has had of this government, the Keating government, is that it so often prostitutes the proper parliamentary processes and does not observe them. Having said that, I do not believe that in this case the government is doing so because we are having a debate on whether there are legitimate reasons for the exemption from the Senate order of 29 November to apply. The coalition believes that there are. I say so for the following reasons, and in doing so I set aside the content of the bill and the substance of the bill because that is a matter for subsequent debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced at the end of December that it would be taking steps in the form of negotiations with the Chinese, with the PRC government, to reach an agreement on the return of those people who have arrived here in the last couple of months by boat and who are not judged to be genuine refugees. The government announced that, and the coalition supported that at the time. Indeed, I was very critical of the government&mdash;and I continue to be critical&mdash;for not having taken action much earlier when it had forewarning of what was going to happen months and months ago, that is, that those boats would arrive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be hypocritical for the coalition to now delay the passage of the legislation which is required to enable the negotiations which have concluded in a memorandum of understanding between the two governments to proceed. As Senator Harradine knows, as Senator Chamarette knows and as Senator Spindler knows, the bill provides for the return of those people who fall into this particular category if they cannot bring forward a genuine refugee claim. I interpose a bit of substance in the bill. Some speakers, in particular Senator Spindler, said that there is no access at all&mdash;if I got him right&mdash;or no opportunity for a Sino-Vietnamese who arrived here by boat in the last two months to put in a refugee claim. That is simply not correct. Let us go into that in the second reading debate. It is not a correct statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government having signed a memorandum of understanding with the PRC government, a bill being required to give effect to that memorandum of understanding, and there being an important time constraint on that, in the interests of the Sino-Vietnamese themselves, in the interests of the whole of our migration program and in the interests of our refugee component of that program, if we really believe in an orderly, fair and equitable program for refugees to Australia&mdash;as the coalition certainly does; I do not know about the Democrats, but we believe that fairness and equity is all important in a refugee program&mdash;then it is necessary to deal with this bill expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has had a considerable debate on this bill. Most of the main players in the field appeared before the committee. We had very lengthy proceedings the other day, which Senator Spindler, Senator Harradine and I participated in. It is certainly true that this bill is being rushed in the sense that, in an ideal world, we would all like more time. There is no doubt about that; I agree with it. But I believe that the circumstances that I have described do indicate and support the need for its early passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were sitting in the next two weeks, I would have quite a different view. But the fact is that parliament is not sitting for the next two weeks. The next sitting week that would enable the passage of the bill takes us to the end of February and the early part of March. By that stage, as I understand it and as the government has explained to Senator Spindler, Senator Harradine, Senator Chamarette and me, we would really have a major problem with the processes that are involved. I believe that the parliamentary program pattern is an unfortunate contributor to this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine made the point, which I fully support, that this bill should not be passed until the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills report on the bill is available to the parliament. My understanding is that the bill was considered by the scrutiny of bills committee overnight or early this morning and that the committee will be reporting to the parliament this afternoon. It is reporting on a bill which is no different from the bill on which it reported in some detail last year. I am not privy to what is in the scrutiny of bills report that will be tabled today, but to say that the scrutiny of bills committee has not had an opportunity to look at the bill until the last couple of days is obviously not correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do agree with Senator Harradine that proper process requires that the scrutiny of bills report be presented here before the bill is passed. That will happen, because the second reading debate will not conclude prior to the scrutiny of bills report becoming available. I am not sure how the timetabling process for this afternoon will go in relation to the Senate. However, one would hope that the processes and the logistics of the time pattern will certainly mean that the debate cannot be concluded until the bill has been received and people have had a chance to look at the scrutiny of bills report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not hold up the Senate any longer, because some of the very important points about the bill that have been raised in this debate by Senator Chamarette, Senator Harradine and Senator Spindler are valid points that need debate. It seems to me that the appropriate time for that debate is the second reading debate on the bill and not this procedural motion. We will be supporting the government in its wish to have the bill considered at this time. Let us get on with the debate on the substance as soon as we can. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Short, I will not go into many of the arguments raised by Senator Chamarette, Senator Harradine and Senator Spindler. In brief, we are talking about a group of people that has had at least $1 billion spent on it over the last 15 years or so in terms of its settlement and protection in China. We are talking about a group of people that has been protected by assistance not only from the PRC but also from the UNHCR.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important for those minority senators to listen to that and to understand it because quite often in Australia we isolate ourselves from international developments in the world debate.

It may not have been recognised in the depths of Victoria, where Senator Spindler comes from, or where Senators Harradine and Chamarette come from, but the reality is what we are doing here is acceptable internationally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not talk much longer, but what I do want to say also goes to some of the criticisms that have been made of the government in terms of the way we handle refugees in this country. Once again it is criticism born out of ignorance. There is much evidence to indicate there is growing support for what is happening in this country in terms of our refugee program, based on the fact that Australia and Australians, with support from both sides of this place, take more refugees per capita than any other part of the world. Smirk you may, Senator Chamarette, but the reality is in the figures. Not only that, when we accept them here we actually have a very good support system, a support system which is recognised by the communities themselves but may not be recognised by those of you who are not part of those communities. We process those who come to this country to see whether they are refugees or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here a letter from the Refugee Council of Australia to the Editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It was written last November in response to some comments made by Paddy McGuiness in an article entitled `Boat people and the law'. I will quote just three paragraphs from this letter because I think it is important that they are put on the record now so that we can get the full flavour of the context of what we are talking about. Margaret Piper, the Executive Director of the refugee council, says in part that the picture McGuiness paints&mdash;the picture basically represented by some of the minority senators here today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a distorted and anachronistic situation, far removed from reality. Driven by bias and misinformation, he ignores both the complexity of the situation and the major developments that have taken place in the last two years.</PARA>

<PARA>She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To accuse the advocates of using "propaganda" and "blackmail" is equally offensive and similarly removed from reality. Refugee advocates use the legal process that exists to ensure that the law is upheld and the rights of their clients are preserved. Two years ago this brought them into regular conflict with the government, but here too things have changed because there is widespread recognition amongst advocates that things are changing for the better.</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe not on a critical level with respect to me and the government but maybe because of the fact that we have some pretty hardworking and earnest public officials working in this area, people from the minority parties should pay recognition to that. Maybe not on a political level but on an administrative level you should pay recognition to the fact that out in the field&mdash;out in the refugee support groups, out in the ethnic communities&mdash;there is a growing appreciation of changes made here and of the drive by the immigration department and the government to try to get a process in place which people can have confidence in. That process has enjoyed enormous levels of confidence over the last couple of years, despite the bickering born out of ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having put that on the record, let me put one other matter on the record for Senator Short. Senator Short said that the government acted late in relation to this, that we had had advice and that we had been warned for months, years or whatever. I say to you, Senator Short, that when the government had information on which to act, when the government had concerns based on solid evidence, it did the first and right thing, and that was talk with the Chinese authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Richardson has been to China I think three times in the last three or four months. The first trip was towards the end of last November. The end result of those trips has been twofold: on the one hand, we have achieved that agreement, in record time in terms of any international standard, with the Chinese, with the PRC, to have people taken back but, on the other hand and as importantly, if not more importantly, we have been able to, in a sense, stem the flow from China. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which we have been debating procedurally but about which we now move into the substantive second reading debate, is a bill to enable the recently enacted safe third country provisions of the Migration Act 1958 to cover Vietnamese refugees who had already been successfully resettled in the People's Republic of China but who lodged claims for a protection visa in Australia after 30 December 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that in his second reading speech. He also said that, more generally, the bill is also to enable the safe third country provisions of the act to have effect from a specified date preceding the date of commencement of any future agreements and relevant regulations. He also pointed out that in the last session of parliament the government introduced safe third country amendments to the Migration Act&mdash;I think they were in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994&mdash;to ensure that certain non-citizens in relation to whom there is a safe third country or who are covered by the comprehensive plan of action for Indochinese refugees known as the CPA should not be allowed to apply for a protection visa. The purpose of that legislation, which the coalition supported at the time and which of course was carried, was to prevent forum shopping by people who had already found a country which offered them protection or whose claims for refugee status had been rejected under an appropriate determination system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first application of that legislation was in respect of people who arrived in Australia from Galang, Indonesia, where they had been assessed as not being refugees under a refugee determination process approved by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In passing that legislation last year, following an amendment moved by the coalition, the Senate required the government to report to the parliament on the screening procedures in Galang. The minister conformed to that requirement with material presented to parliament last week. We have not had a chance to go into that in the Senate since then, but we certainly will be doing so in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks specifically to amend the Migration Act to create a safe third country agreement with the People's Republic of China to facilitate the return of Sino-Vietnamese boat people, particularly the approximately 700 people who have arrived here on eight or nine boats since the middle of November last year. The bill provides that Vietnamese refugees who have already had protection afforded to them by the PRC will not be permitted to make an application for protection in Australia, unless they can produce substantive evidence to suggest that they are in a genuine refugee situation. I will come to that matter in a moment. The bill also provides that if an application has already been made, after 30 December 1994, that application will cease to be valid. That date of 30 December is the date on which the minister made the announcements which foreshadowed this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also states that, in relation to future safe third country regulations, certain visa applications will cease to be valid if made during a transitional period before the safe third country regulations take effect. That transitional period may start at a time specified by the minister, usually in a press release following the safe third country agreement, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> or a maximum of six months before the regulations take effect. This effectively means that, in the future, when the government wishes to set up an STC agreement, it does not have to go to parliament in order to backdate the provisions of the agreement. But it is important to note that it would be doing that instead by way of regulation which would be disallowable by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, since 13 November almost 700 Sino-Vietnamese have arrived illegally in Australia from the port of Baihai in southern China. The persons we are talking about started to arrive in mainland China in 1978, after the conclusion of the China-Vietnam border conflicts that preceded. That movement was stimulated by the border conflict between the PRC and Vietnam. Those refugees were issued with papers and, under the supervision of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&mdash;and I think this is important&mdash;were resettled in both urban and rural China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UNHCR was actually invited by the PRC government to supervise that resettlement process. I think the UNHCR has had a presence there since 1981. Approximately 284,000 persons moved from Vietnam to China in this way between 1978 and the late 1980s. The Chinese government has spent an estimated $US760 million on projects to assist resettlement and the UNHCR has contributed an additional $82 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The movement of the Sino-Vietnamese people from China that we have witnessed in recent weeks is not, of course, the first time that such people have left China in search of a better life&mdash;a very understandable search for a better life. They were involved in movements from the PRC to Macau in the early 1980s and, more recently, to Japan and to Hong Kong. Similar third country agreements to that now being envisaged in this bill, the third agreement between Australia and the PRC, were signed between the PRC and Hong Kong in 1991 and between the PRC and Japan in, I think, 1993. They were to allow for the return, under the protection of the PRC, of about 23,000 people who had gone to Hong Kong, and about 1,500 that had gone to Japan. They were returned under that safe third country agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is proposed here is not new. As I understand it, it basically follows the pattern that was followed in at least those cases. The available evidence from those cases that was presented to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its hearings on this bill last week suggests quite strongly that the people who returned from Hong Kong and Japan were accepted back, have had the protection of the PRC and have not been persecuted in any way as a result of their return. The available evidence also suggests that the Sino-Vietnamese arrivals in recent weeks left China in search of a better life rather than because they are genuine refugees within the meaning of the definition contained in the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees, as amended by the 1967 protocol. The definition of a refugee, contained in the convention, is a person who:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for persecution enumerated in the 1951 convention, usually termed `Convention reasons', constitute the exclusive reasons for persecution that will entitle an individual to a claim for refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA>We are a signatory to that agreement, as are many other countries, including the PRC, and it is very important that the actions of a country such as Australia&mdash;particularly Australia, from our point of view&mdash;accord with that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly would not&mdash;I do not think anyone would&mdash;blame the latest boat arrivals for wanting a better life. So they should. The point is: taking to the boats in this way is not the way to do it because of the impact it has, not only on the people, but on other refugees and on Australia's excellent refugee program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing this bill, and we have taken that view for several reasons. That is not to say that we do not have some concerns about the bill. I know my colleagues Senator Abetz and Senator Ellison, who will also be speaking in this debate, will take up some of those concerns, so I will not go into them in detail here, but I will leave it to my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that the bill has nothing to do with China's one-child policy. There has been some confusion in the public mind on this. China's one-child policy, which is the subject of a separate bill which will be debated and considered in the Senate in due course, essentially does not apply to Sino-Vietnamese. That is a point that needs to be made clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has also taken account of the fact that there is scope provided in the bill for a Sino-Vietnamese boat person to make application for refugee status. That is done through the minister's non-compellable discretion contained in proposed new subsection 91F(1). The report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed Subsection 91F(1) allows for the Minister, if he believes that it is in the public interest, to exempt persons from the STC provisions proposed by the Bill. An exercise of the discretion in an individual's favour would allow that individual to lodge an application for the determination of his or her refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the government that we place considerable importance on that point. If this bill is to be applied fairly and equitably, taking into account Australia's responsibilities in the area of refugees and humanitarian care, then there must be a mechanism which will enable genuine applicants for refugee status to have their situation brought to the attention of the government and the minister and to have that discretion exercised. We accept, of course, that it is a non-compellable discretion. But we were told in the committee hearings that mechanisms and provisions would be put in place to ensure that proposed new section 91F does have practical application. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, in its conclusion, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They believe that it would be appropriate if the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs emphasised the procedures to deal with claims by Sino Vietnamese for refugee status and to deal with identification and with verification of individual's status as Sino-Vietnamese.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe we should go further than that in the sense of seeking a clear undertaking from the minister in regard to that. I am sure my colleagues will pursue that point at some additional length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In not opposing the bill, we have placed much weight on the views of the UNHCR. According to the regional representative of the UNHCR for Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific, Mr Fontaine, who was a UNHCR representative in China for two or three years in the early 1990s, there is no evidence, as I said earlier, that once returned the Sino-Vietnamese will be subject to persecution. He told the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee at public hearings into this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a former chief of mission in China . . . I crisscrossed southern China between October 1990 and December 1992, both to monitor the implementation of projects which are financed by UNHCR, and to ensure that the protection of these people was properly carried out . . . What I can say and what UNHCR knows, is that we do not, as a group, have any information that would lead to the conclusion that, as a group, that these people have protection problems in China of any great significance.</PARA>
<PARA>He also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I happened to be in China at the time of the return of the 1142 Vietnamese refugees who had gone to Japan, and I can guarantee you that there were no </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">reprisals taken against those people. There was no persecution of them.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be more categorical than that from the UNHCR's official representative. I say again: the coalition has placed a great deal of weight on the evidence from Mr Fontaine. I have also mentioned the fact that the bill continues to permit the consideration of genuine refugee claims by way of ministerial discretion. I will not comment further on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having dealt with the bill in that sense, I say in the strongest possible terms that I believe the situation this bill is designed to arrest should never have arisen. The Keating government and the responsible minister, Senator Bolkus, have been quite culpable in their failure to act earlier and in their continuing procrastination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December, the minister admitted publicly that he had been warned as long ago as April of last year that the influx we have seen of boats in recent weeks, particularly in that period of six or seven weeks from mid-November, would occur. He was told about it last April and did nothing at all about it. The minister must be held responsible for a large part of the concern that is now being felt by the general Australian community, who are concerned about the situation, and for the very real concern that has been generated on the part of the people who have come here and those who are aspiring to come to Australia as refugees generally. That is a situation that this minister will wear as a cross for a long time. It has led to great hardship and great concern on the part of a very large number of people including very genuine refugee seekers and refugee applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been drawing attention to this matter and these concerns for a considerable amount of time. It was only after the inflow had occurred that the government decided to take action. It is all very well for the minister to say now that he really could not do anything about negotiating before boats came along. What he did was fail to send the necessary signals to prevent this situation arising in the first instance. So we hold the minister very responsible for the regrettable situation that has arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, I repeat that the coalition will not be opposing this legislation. We do believe it is necessary that this legislation be passed to get the clearest signal possible to the Chinese authorities and to impending boat people that, unless they are really and truly genuine refugee applicants, they will not be accepted into Australia if they come in a way which undermines Australia's orderly, case by case, offshore migration program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The bill does mark a low point in Australia's treatment of refugees. It is a shame and a black day for this parliament that the government is able to pass it&mdash;in fact, to rush it through&mdash;with the assistance of the coalition parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the safe third country provisions in the Migration Act 1958, firstly to invalidate applications for protection visas made by Vietnamese refugees presently resettled in the People's Republic of China between 30 December 1994 and the taking effect of statutory rule No. 3 of 1995, which prescribes the PRC as a safe third country, and more generally to invalidate visa applications made during the transitional period before the commencement of an agreement between Australia and a safe third country. The regulation was made possible by a memorandum of understanding signed with the government of China on 25 January this year and has been prompted largely by the recent arrival in Australia of Sino-Vietnamese boat people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant policy aspect of the bill is to recognise the PRC, China, as a safe third country. The safe third country concept was introduced into Australian law in last year's Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994. It provides that certain people who have a prescribed connection with a country either covered by the comprehensive plan of action or with which Australia has a safe third country agreement cannot be allowed to apply for an individual protection visa. The Australian government argues that because the PRC has provided a community of Sino-Vietnamese refugees with housing, land and access to other facilities it is appropriate to prescribe the PRC as being a safe third country for the purposes of that community. Obviously, this argument is seriously flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the PRC's well-known, unsatisfactory human rights record, it is cynical in the extreme for the government to now seek to designate the PRC as a so-called safe third country. When appearing before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Mr Dennis Richardson, who is from the department, conceded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expression of concerns about China's general human rights record is a very legitimate point to make. Successive Australian Governments have consistently expressed concern about aspects of China's human rights record  . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That, apparently, does not appear to worry the government in introducing a bill that, nevertheless, describes the PRC as a safe third country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the Indo-China Refugee Association, Mrs Marion Le, added that her association strongly objected to the prescribing of the People's Republic of China as a safe third country for a particular minority group, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">China continues to be . . . a totalitarian dictatorship with an appalling human rights record.</PARA>
<PARA>One can only say, `Hear, hear!' I believe that the government as well as the coalition parties will have to live with what they do in this particular bill when we continue to receive news of human rights violations in the PRC. We might just briefly reflect on the fact that the United States has in recent times taken a much stronger stand, as far as China is concerned, on the human rights issue. It is a stance that, to our shame, we do not seem to be prepared to emulate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also say that, for a number of reasons, I am not convinced by the arguments put forward by Senator Short that we should place great reliance on the observations made by Mr Fontaine, the UNHCR commissioner, who has spent some time in China. Firstly, I think his presence in China is now some time ago. Secondly, Mr Fontaine is only one person. He is not individually affected by what happens to the people who are living in China as refugees from Vietnam. I believe it is our obligation to assess what the people themselves have experienced. In fact, we have the record, our own record, of that having been done, inasmuch as we know that substantial majorities of previous boat loads of people who have come to Australia have been found to be refugees under the United Nations' definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why all of a sudden this painstaking individual assessment of the people who have arrived here in Australia seeking asylum should be discarded, just because an official says that, according to his observation, they have not as a group experienced any persecution in China, is beyond me. I do not think that is a sufficient ground at all. Even though they as a group may not have been singled out, that does not exclude individual members of that group having been exposed to persecution and having a well-founded fear of further persecution. I believe it is that point we need to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable evidence of discrimination, on the part of the PRC government, against certain Sino-Vietnamese. Evidence of this was presented to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Ms Phillipa Martin, who worked in Port Hedland for the Refugee Council, explained that Sino-Vietnamese were not given the same rights as Chinese nationals. She gave an account of one family, who arrived on a boat named the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dalmatian</EMPHASIS>, having been expelled from Vietnam in 1979. After spending time caught in the war between the Chinese and the Vietnamese, they were transported to a remote arid area and left with a small amount of rice; they indeed found it difficult to survive. As they were not given household registration, they were forced to work for very low pay and were unable to move. They were also forced to pay higher rates for education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another account was given of P who was born on Cat Ba Island. He was eight years old when he was sent to Beihai to meet up with his mother; he did not meet up with her. But on arriving at Beihai he was placed in the care of an old lady who survived by scavenging in refuse dumps. He was unable to attend school, was not eligible for food coupons and was not able to get free or subsidised health care. His house was demolished in June. He wanted to marry, but without household registration he was unable to get a marriage certificate. He sought a new life in Australia&mdash;and was, indeed, characterised as a refugee. He and some other people were successful in their application for refugee status in Australia. Indeed, all seven people on board the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dalmatian</EMPHASIS> and 46 out of 53 people on board the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pluto</EMPHASIS> were accepted as refugees by Australia. Of the Sino-Vietnamese on board the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Toto</EMPHASIS>, six were accepted as refugees, and all 51 people on board the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Unicorn</EMPHASIS> were accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if this bill becomes law, people in similar circumstances will be prevented from being granted refugee status, with the one exception that was outlined: a non-compellable discretion to be exercised by the minister&mdash;and I will come to that a little later. Our obligations under the convention relating to refugees will remain the same, the only change being the limitation of the application of international law in Australian courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, has argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fact that the government did not appreciate the reach of the convention . . . [at the time of its signing] cannot change the meaning of the convention nor the obligations assumed under it.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Manocha said on behalf of the Ethnic Communities Council of the ACT that, if Australia does not consider it has an obligation to specifically consider the claims of those people persecuted or in fear of persecution owing to their membership of a particular group, it should either withdraw from the 1951 refugees convention or limit, by reservation, its interpretation of its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is a rhetorical challenge to say that the Australian government, in passing and proposing to pass legislation such as this bill, is not meeting its obligations under the convention. China cannot be a safe third country since the Sino-Vietnamese applicants for refugee status are not making claims of persecution against their country of origin, Vietnam, but rather against the designated country itself&mdash;China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia has responded that, in these circumstances, it is logically and factually difficult to regard China as being a designated safe third country for these asylum seekers. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Vietnamese are making claims of persecution against China, it would seem totally inappropriate and an abdication of Australia's international obligations to persons seeking refugee protection on our shores to designate China a safe third country in respect of these people.</PARA>
<PARA>One can only say, `Hear, hear.' Another witness before the committee, Mr Pierre-Michel Fontaine, agreed, arguing that this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . purports to decree that any person in a defined category is, by definition, someone who cannot possibly have a valid refugee claim, simply on the basis of the consideration that their fear of persecution by the Vietnamese authorities 10 or so years ago were satisfactorily taken care of through the UNHCR supervisory element in the PRC.</PARA>
<PARA>There is another element in this bill which is causing concern; that is, its retrospective effect. It was designed to invalidate visa applications which had been made before the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) even announced this legislation. These applications were made on the basis of the law as it stood when these asylum seekers arrived. People who make such applications have, I believe, a legitimate expectation that the procedure will not change before the application has been assessed on its merits. As noted by the Law Council of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea of legislation of a retrospective nature dealing with matters raised in a media release made by the Minister is abhorrent, particularly in circumstances where the Minister may well be reacting to the political pressures of the time.</PARA>
<PARA>I now turn to the non-compellable ministerial discretion. In proposed new subsection 91F(1)(b), the minister may determine that section 91G does not apply if it is `in the public interest to do so' to a particular non-citizen. This discretion is put forward as a safeguard against genuine refugees being refused access arbitrarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, its practical effect is obviously limited. For example, the committee has had evidence that the recent processing of 26 applicants for refugee status within 48 hours left no real opportunities for ministerial review. It would be even more difficult if the department's maximum estimate of 5,000 boat arrivals ever eventuated. Eve Lester, from the Refugee Advisory Casework Service, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not actually accept that the suggestion of 5,000 is accurate, but if that is the case, and the minister is faced with a large number of people, how can that in all reasonableness, be described as a safeguard? It is simply not.</PARA>
<PARA>Applications for refugee status are sometimes made from overseas, and there is no provision for any procedures to deal with that eventuality. Further, the criterion of public interest, as defined by the minister, does not necessarily equate with Australia's responsibility to assess refugee status according to the international convention on refugees or on the basis of humanitarian considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is obviously no clear provision on how the asylum seeker can trigger consideration of his or her case by the minister. I hope that the minister and the department will take note of the observations made by the committee in its report, which suggests that clear procedures need to be laid down to ensure that asylum seekers are made aware of this possibility. I add to that that there should also be a clear obligation on the part of the department to inform people arriving on Australia's shores of their legal rights, something that on the basis of evidence received has simply not happened in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Australian Democrats believe that this bill is so faulty, both in its objective and in its execution, that the Senate should accept its responsibility to throw it out. It does mark a low point in Australia's treatment of refugees. I believe that, as in a number of other areas&mdash;and I will just briefly mention East Timor&mdash;we are giving up a claim to being a champion of human rights in the region, a claim which at one point may have been justified, but, increasingly, we are wasting it. Increasingly, this government and, in this case, the coalition parties are putting their names to legislation which can only be described as contrary to the principles of human rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. At the outset, let me say that I speak on this bill with some mixed feelings. Most witnesses that came before the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee looking into this bill complained about the shortness of time the committee had to consider the impact of this legislation. Similarly, I join with them and indicate that I share their concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow spokesman on immigration, Senator Short, has indicated, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) had ample notice of this evolving problem. Indeed, on 30 December last year the minister made a statement as to what his intentions would be once the parliament resumed. Whilst I accept that the situation that faces Australia is an urgent one, I would have thought that the ethnic communities and those organisations that seek to assist refugees and those people that come to our shores could have been provided with an exposure draft of the legislation and further information a lot earlier than they actually were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I will turn to the bill. In my view the bill deals with a fundamental issue of principle&mdash;that is, the conflict between dealing with a difficult situation and yet looking after individual needs at the same time. That is the balancing act that has to be undertaken by all governments from time to time. It appears to me that the government has approached this issue on the basis that it will deal with the 99.9 per cent as being basically, in its terms, the problem and then hope that it has a mechanism to look after the 0.1 per cent who may be treated harshly as a result of this bill. My own prejudice is that I would seek to have greater protection for the 0.1 per cent rather than try to deal with the so-called problem of the 99.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, Australia is in some difficulty when it has had arrive on its shores since 13 November last year nine boats containing some 676 Sino-Vietnamese. It should not be forgotten in this debate that these people started arriving as early as 1978. It has been an ongoing situation for our country to consider and tackle, if it were seen as a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threshold question really is: how do we assess and provide protection for an individual who may well have a reasonably based fear of persecution despite coming from a so-called safe third country? The safe third country legislation, as has been indicated by previous speakers, was inserted into our migration legislation towards the end of last year as a mechanism that could be applied, but there was no direct application of that mechanism until the Migration  Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks, in effect, to limit the status of `safe third country' not to all people coming from the People's Republic of China but only to those who are classified as Sino-Vietnamese. So in general terms it has a fairly limited global application. My concern, as I indicated earlier, was that whilst we, sitting comfortably in Canberra, may say that it has a very limited application, I dare say that if you were one of the refugees at Port Hedland you would not be saying that because it would have direct application on you personally. That is the concern I had with the way this legislation is structured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation seeks to declare the People's Republic of China, or the PRC, as a safe third country for the purposes of the Sino-Vietnamese people. I have some difficulty in accepting the logic that the Sino-Vietnamese are in a safe third country because, as Senator Spindler pointed out, these people allege that they are fleeing from China and not from Vietnam. When you are fleeing from China it would be somewhat galling to be told by a country such as Australia that you will be sent back to a `safe' third country&mdash;the country that you are fleeing. I have very real difficulties with that. Legally and technically I am advised that the Sino-Vietnamese are still classified as Vietnamese nationals and, therefore, having originally fled or left Vietnam&mdash;albeit ten or 15 years ago&mdash;they are now in a third country which we are now going to describe as safe for them, despite the fact that because they believed China was not a safe country they fled to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That to my mind provides a very real problem in this legislation. Indeed, it may well cause a problem for the government if this legislation is ever tested. I would have thought that those Sino-Vietnamese, whom this legislation is intended to target, would be able to assert, and assert forcefully, that the PRC is their country of habitual residency. The Law Council of Australia submitted in its submission to the legal and constitutional committee at paragraph 3.5 the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The questions which arise and which should be addressed in any proper and fair system of refugee determination include whether or not these people have a nationality or are stateless and whether or not, considering the definition of refugee, they should be treated as being nationals of  Vietnam or habitual residents of China. These issues are fundamental to their proper treatment by Departmental decision-makers in Australia and relevant to a consideration of the purpose and effect of the amendments proposed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Law Council's representative, Mr Peter Rose, said at page 102 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of that committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The view that we have at the moment is that it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the People's Republic of China&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">appears to be a country of habitual residence rather than a third country.</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Bar Association also expressed its concern at page 2 of its submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view the retrospective operation of the safe third country provisions of the Migration Act in the manner proposed by this Bill is unjust. The right of persons to apply for refugee status is fundamentally important for the maintenance of human rights. If this right is to be retrospectively removed, there should be compelling reasons to do so. We do not believe that questions of administrative convenience and the fact that there will be `some savings in onshore refugee determination processing costs' constitutes such compelling reasons in the present circumstances. Nor do we believe that the provisions of the bill enabling the Minister to waive the retrospectivity provisions in an individual case will operate to overcome effectively any injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Fonteyne, a doctor of law at the Australian National University, said the following in his submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill clearly illustrates the dangers inherent in the `safe third country' concept incorporated in the Migration Act late last year. Based on a rather simplistic and formalistic Memorandum of Understanding reached with the PRC Government, the bill purports to decree that any person in the defined category is by definition someone who cannot possibly have a valid refugee claim&mdash;simply on the basis of the consideration that their fear of persecution by the Vietnamese authorities 10 or so years ago were satisfactorily taken care of through UNHCR&mdash;supervised resettlement in the PRC. What it of course ignores is the possibility that the resettled refugees may now in turn have become a target of persecution at the hands of the authorities in their country of refuge&mdash;which may or may not be the case in fact.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpose that on all the evidence it would seem that they are not being persecuted by the People's Republic of China. I want to acknowledge that. But, nevertheless, just in case there are some among these hundreds of people who are genuinely suffering, I do have concerns. Dr Fonteyne goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The important point, though, is that the Government is seeking to make such a determination as a matter of general finding, thereby precluding (other than, once again, through discretionary ministerial dispensation) consideration of an individual's particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>So on the face of it there are very real concerns about this legislation. We need to rely on the goodwill of the department, the minister and the administrative processes that are to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised by departmental officers&mdash;I thank them for giving me that understanding of how the system works&mdash;that when these boat people arrive in Australia they will be held in the appropriate camps and that the appropriate checks will then be made with the Chinese authorities to ascertain whether these people are known to the Chinese government. If they are known to the Chinese government, safe third country status will apply to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Checking that out will take a matter of weeks. During that time, one would imagine that those organisations and groups that do such a marvellous job for the refugees and other boat people that have arrived in Australia will also be able to sort through them and talk to these people to ascertain whether any of them have genuine refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each individual boat person is submitted to an individual interview by a departmental officer. One would hope that those departmental officers are at all times fully alert to the possibility of one of these people&mdash;in other words, each individual&mdash;being an appropriate person to submit to the minister for the purposes of going through the normal channels, if I can so describe it, to seek refugee status. But if that public servant who interviews fails to do so, that person's chance of being provided with that status may well fall. If that happens, there would be a great injustice. As I understand it, the system would also require the interviewing officer to send his or her report on each individual interview to another departmental officer, who will also check the written version of that interview to ascertain whether there are any hints within the documentation that might indicate an appropriate refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, all we can do is rely on the goodwill of the minister and the department. I have difficulties with that. I see Senator Chamarette frowning at that, and I must say that in my heart of hearts I share that concern. Whilst the legislation on its face is very harsh, once you look at the way it is actually implemented there is the possibility that the minister, undoubtedly not in person but once again through a public servant, would provide status to allow them to go through the refugee assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the minister's discretion in this is non-compellable. We were told at the committee hearing on this bill that the reason for that is it is basically how it is in other parts of the legislation. I am not sure that that in itself is a compelling reason as to why the minister ought to be granted the same power in this particular circumstance. Non-compellability basically means that if the minister does not make an appropriate decision there is no recourse and the person will simply have to accept the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are confronted with a government that fiddled whilst Rome was burning. Government members fiddled whilst the problem, as they describe it as a problem, developed and then all of a sudden, when they were overwhelmed by the nine boats that had arrived since 13 November, the minister decided to take action, and quick action. Whilst the taking of quick action is to be applauded, there are different ways of going about that sort of action. For example, if this legislation had been delayed another fortnight I do not think we would have seen a flood of boats from Beihai coming to Australia. I have some concern as to the overwhelming urgency with which this matter has been treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, it does play to a sentiment within the Australian community that the Australian community has basically been targeted as a soft spot for people who are seeking economic refugee status in Australia simply because they want a better life. If that is the case, I would argue we have basic problems with the total administration of the system. We should not simply target the Sino-Vietnamese and allow the minister, by simple regulation in the future, to declare more and more safe third countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out in fairness to this debate&mdash;this is another one of those safeguards that has enabled me to feel somewhat more comfortable with this legislation&mdash;that whenever the minister makes a regulation in adding another country, or another group of people from a country, to safe third country status that regulation is subject to disallowance by this Senate or, indeed, the House of Representatives. There is once again another safeguard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this whole process has been rushed. I know the people of Australia clearly are saying in relation to those seeking economic refuge that enough is enough and the government ought to act. The government has acted, and it has acted quickly and promptly, but I think it has rushed too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, delaying this legislation for another 14 days to allow other groups to have the full opportunity to consider the impact of this legislation would not have led to a rush of other boat people to this country. We may have been able to deal with the legislation, the committee system and all the other aspects of this bill in a more orderly fashion and possibly have come up with a conclusion which would have been a safeguard for the Sino-Vietnamese boat people and also future categories of people who may be provided with STC status. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very much appreciated the comments by Senator Abetz that I was able to hear. I regret that, being engaged in a discussion on another matter, I did not hear all of them. I agree with him that it may have been far better to have had a further fortnight to look at this legislation. I note for the public record one of the rare occasions when Senator Abetz and I are in almost complete agreement. Unfortunately, because his party did not vote a certain way, we are not on the same sides of the debate at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is yet another bill in a long line of disgraceful pieces of legislation in the area of administration of Australia's onshore refugee program. Of course, I use the term `onshore refugee program' in the broadest construction possible because this government does not have a program as such. It has a shambles of a system which lurches from one crisis to another and from one policy change to another, basically plugging up loopholes that have appeared. I will not recount the sorry tale of misery which the government has inflicted on asylum seekers who have arrived unannounced. We all know the story too well. Neither will I recount the shameful trail of legislation which has marked each new repressive step in the government's response to these groups whom we have now all come to know as `boat people'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is perhaps one small Pyrrhic victory or kind of black comedy in this bill for those of us who have opposed the government's refugee policies over the years, and that is that it demonstrates once and for all that detention does not work as a deterrent. When we consider the sad history of the past five years, we see that hundreds of people have had their fundamental rights to liberty and due process systematically abused by this government. It is apparent that sending a strong signal&mdash;that phrase so much loved by this government&mdash;has been a dismal failure. Providing, in my view, a repressive measure directed towards the Sino-Vietnamese will send a signal, but there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest it has any impact on those people who, for reasons apart from the ones that have been implied here in earlier debate, are driven to flee their countries, seek these shores and seek asylum&mdash;for which we, in all conscience, should be giving them a due process by which they can be considered to warrant it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should the government ever have thought that detention would work? Of course, people facing physical danger and uncertainty in the aftermath of the Cambodian peace process would choose to flee. Faced with the coercive family planning policies in China, of course people would flee. The government has so far not dealt adequately with allegations of corruption in the refugee assessment process in Indonesia but wants to declare those who come here after Galang to be not eligible to apply for a protection visa. Where will it end?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is very proud of its record in making 13,000 places available in its refugee and humanitarian program this year. I do not want to minimise the significance of that. It is a credit to the government and it is certainly to be supported. But, when the same government claims to be a champion of human rights throughout the world while it denies the existence of some human rights abuses to suit its own convenience, the government shows itself for what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Abetz referred to the need to move away from these short-term ad hoc changes to a long-term view that demonstrates where the government is coming from in relation to its onshore program and also its response to asylum seekers. I would venture to suggest that the reason why it does not do that is that it is playing with a double standard.  On the one hand, it wants to be seen as very enlightened, very progressive and a protector of human rights throughout the world. On the other hand, it is absolutely paranoid about people who approach our shores without pieces of paper. If it actually provided a policy that laid that on the line, it would be exposed to ridicule and humiliation because it does place itself in a double standard position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some specific comments on the bill, but I have already made them quite clear in the previous debate. The information that has arisen from the committee process has been very valuable. I have read it. I have not had the time that this issue deserves to analyse its impact. I am grateful for the comments from the various speakers, including the minister's, that have added to my information about that. In response to the minister's accusation that I am speaking from ignorance, if that is a genuine concern of the minister, then he could clearly have allowed time for those of us whom he considers to be ignorant to gain the information we seek or need to be less concerned about the approach that the government is taking. I do not think it is ignorance; it is that we have a different analysis of what is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will have further questions in the committee process. I do not assume that I have been able to grasp the full implications of this bill. There are various matters I want to raise. Firstly, there is the matter in this bill which relates to the PRC gaining safe third country status. I believe evidence was presented to the committee that this is highly questionable. Mr Matthew Zagor of Amnesty International Australia produced evidence to the committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amnesty is unaware of the safe third country definition being applied to the very country where the alleged violations which are the grounds for a claim are occurring . . . This is a misuse of our legislation and it refuses to recognise legitimate concerns about the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China. The use of the safe third country legislation will exclude an entire group of people from making claims on any grounds. In other words, if you are a Vietnamese refugee who has settled in China, no matter what may have happened to you in China, you will be sent back . . .  The government is deciding and implementing that decision in law that no Vietnamese are facing persecution of any kind whatsoever in the People's Republic of China.</PARA>
<PARA>I know there is one escape clause there which lies in the discretion of the minister, and I will raise that possible safeguard in the committee stage with the minister. The second aspect of grave concern is that of the retrospectivity impact of this bill. We see that two areas are affected by retrospectivity. One is in relation to the Sino-Vietnamese who have already been granted status. This bill will backdate the granting of the safe third country status to the PRC to 30 December 1994, which, as somebody pointed out, is the date of the minister's press statement. So here we have legislation enacting a press statement. The bill, by that effect, will basically take away the status that has already been granted to some people. Therefore, we have an injustice that will be apparent in its effect on numbers of people who have already received some kind of acceptance into the refugee application process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill is retrospective in that it sets up a legal regime where the minister can announce in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> a cut-off day prior to a safe third country being gazetted in the usual manner in accordance with the principal act, the Migration Act. That means that at any point, if the minister chooses, the granting of an STC&mdash;or safe third country status&mdash;will immediately blank out and have an effect on those people who may have already been granted their refugee status. I emphasise that this is a question I want to ask the minister so, if there is an error of assumption on my part, I would be very glad to have it cleared up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will sum up the concerns about the retrospective operation of STCs in a quote from the New South Wales Bar Association at the committee's hearings. It criticised the retrospective operation of the STC provisions of the Migration Act, in the manner proposed in the bill, by saying they were unjust. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right of persons to apply for refugee status is fundamentally important for the maintenance of human rights. If this right is to be retrospectively removed, there should be compelling reasons to do so. We do not believe that questions of administrative convenience and the fact that there will be "some savings in onshore refugee determination processing costs" constitute such compelling reasons in the present circumstances. Nor do we believe that the provisions of the bill enable the minister to waive the retrospective provisions in individual cases will operate to overcome effectively any injustice.</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, it seems to me that the group, rather than the individual, is receiving a determination. That seems highly undesirable. I will quote from the minority report put forward by Senator Spindler, noting that he did not refer to it earlier. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Marion Le argued before the Committee, the measures in this bill appear to have been designed to act as a deterrent to would-be applicants, irrespective of their merit, and that the legislation represents an attempt to turn refugee processing back into an ad hoc decision making process by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Ms Le asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the point of a refugee definition that gets narrowed every time it looks like there may be too many refugees?</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the bill is discriminatory against Vietnamese nationals. I will quote Ms Angela Chan, Chairperson of the Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also believe that the proposed legislation is discriminatory: it discriminates against people from the PRC and the Vietnamese. It also opposes a general policy of access and equity and Australia's general commitment to multiculturalism. Is it a subtle return to the white Australia policy?</PARA>
<PARA>I know that they are strong terms and I think the minister has to respond to a very strong case that this bill is discriminatory in its operation and in its design. I will quote from the submission of the Catholic Bishops Conference to the legal and constitutional committee. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the Australian Government has declared China a Safe Third Country and made a pact with that country to trade off what appears to be one human rights abuse for another. Australia agrees to overlook the asylum seekers claims of human rights abuses in China if the Chinese government will cooperate with Australia in denying the people's right to seek relief here and on condition that Australia pay all the costs.</PARA>
<PARA>We heard the minister say that people are horrified that we are offering, or even being seen to offer, protection to people on whom, he says, $1 billion has been spent by the UNHCR and the PRC. I wonder how the public will react to the government's agreement with China to pay costs involved in repatriating the boat people? What costs and compensation has the government agreed to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know how the phone lines in my office rang hot when the possibility arose that those boat people who have been detained illegally may be able to claim compensation. I recall the abuse heaped on those who support the asylum seekers' rights in this matter by government senators at the time. Perhaps those same government senators might now like to put the same arguments to the cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a disgrace. It shows conclusively what the government thinks of the rule of law in relation to asylum seekers. It once again shows that the government cannot bear to lose in the courts and that it wants unilaterally to change the entire corpus of international law in relation to refugees. We will oppose this bill as we have opposed its predecessors. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also had the gall this morning to swear at me across the chamber because I quoted Sir Ronald Wilson's opposition to bill No. 2. When I was about to quote Sir Ronald Wilson's opposition to the No. 2 bill&mdash;I believe it was very important for me to do so, Sir Ronald Wilson being the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission&mdash;Minister Bolkus swore at me across the chamber and said that Sir Ronald's opposition was to bill No. 3, not to No. 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That shows that the minister himself is ignorant. That shows that neither he nor the government&mdash;nor presumably his advisers, because surely they would have pulled him up&mdash;has taken the opportunity to read the evidence. Page 176 of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examination of this matter on Friday shows what Sir Ronald Wilson said, and it related to the No. 2 bill which we are discussing now. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A related concern is attracted by certain provisions of the No. 2 Bill (for example, s 4(2)(a)), which reflect a failure to respect the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA>Are we going to vote for a measure that fails to respect the rule of law? That is an important matter for consideration by this chamber. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of authorising an arbitrary interference with the existing rights of an individual coupled with a denial of any judicial review might be thought to be inconsistent with the fundamental practices and policies of a civilised community.</PARA>
<PARA>If we are talking about principle, let us listen to those who are asking us to consider those principles to see whether this measure does fit within and observe those principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does this measure fit within and enhance the observance by Australia of its international responsibilities in respect of refugees? In my assessment it does not. By making China a safe third country, this measure attempts to treat, as I think Senator Spindler said this morning, persons holus bolus as a group and to send them back without giving any effective means or opportunity to any one of them to voice their concerns about what might be gross violations of human rights and a well-founded fear of persecution on their return to China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all agree that China has an abysmal record of gross and continuing violations of human rights. We all should agree and understand that the complaints and the fear persons have is not a persecution if they are returned to Vietnam but a persecution if they are returned to China. The only remedy for that is the non-compellable discretion which the bill gives to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to accuse, nor have I, any of those who are working in the department. I acknowledge that departmental officials are worked very hard, and in many cases overworked&mdash;as indeed was the secretariat of the legal and constitutional affairs committee. They did an extraordinary job. I am not accusing those people at all. I happen to believe that refugee issues should be handled by a unit other than the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs because I think it really falls within another area of principle and concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that the current officers should not be perhaps transferred for that purpose, but I do believe that this is a matter which should be strictly tested against human rights principles, the principle of the rule of law and our obligations under the status of refugee convention and protocol. We have heard all about our international obligations under conventions and protocols in a previous debate, so let us start applying them here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go now to the report of the committee which listed three major new issues. Page 8 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>.whether it is appropriate to prescribe the PRC as a safe third country</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.whether the non-compellable discretion vested in the Minister by proposed section 91F is a sufficient balance to the procedures in the Bill which take effect by operation of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the retrospective effect of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA>I will not have time before the debate is interrupted to go into that question, but I will talk briefly about the other side of the coin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister might talk about bleeding hearts. He talks in that sense in one way and then talks about the public pressure in another way. Yes, members of parliament in a democracy are elected to represent the interests of those who elected them. But does that mean that when we are faced with issues we should interpret the position to mean, `That is the way my people are going. I am their leader. I must follow them'? Surely we are not in that sort of business&mdash;particularly when it comes to refugees and to minorities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have to have regard to this. I raise this because the question of public interest is in this bill and the question of public interest has arisen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public interest I raise this afternoon is the shameless way in which the extreme green elements and Labor have connived to form a coalition which has resulted in the current debacle in regional Australia over the forest industry. The Labor Party, adopting the Richo line of doing `whatever it takes', has embraced the green movement and is now severely embarrassed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you engage in activity Prince Charles is alleged to have engaged in, you cannot complain about the green stains on your pyjamas. Similarly, if you engage in the activity of Labor embracing the extreme greens, then you cannot complain if there are nasty green stains all over your forest policy. That is exactly what Labor is doing. Having embraced the extreme greens to win the last few elections, the Labor Party is now retreating from the greens as quickly as it possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As polls and research are showing, there is a decline in support for the greens. Their support is now down to two per cent. Labor's support is slipping. We all know about the decline in trade union membership and, in recent times, even in the Australian Conservation Foundation. In its latest annual report, its treasurer, Simon Rowell, tells us donations fell by $530,000. So the public of Australia are stopping their support of the Australian Conservation Foundation. But do not be mistaken: the previous paragraph tells us Commonwealth government grants increased by $600,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there we have Labor and green in bed together, yet again. When the public desert the Australian Conservation Foundation, no longer wanting to fund it, in rushes the Labor Party with an equivalent, if not greater, sum to make up the difference. All that Labor really is now doing is trying to change the status of the relationship from the full-time de facto with the greens to the part-time mistress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor provided stories to the media saying that it will review its relationship with the greens. They are all in the media today. Headlines such as `Govt's new view of greenies' and similar headlines appear in our papers today. But that is only as a result of the government having been bruised by the huge backlash over the forestry row. Labor so actively pursued the greens that it now finds itself entangled in the green web as the prisoner of the extreme green movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party cannot complain. When it employs people such as Tony Fleming, and in particular Simon Balderstone, as its senior environmental advisers, then it is obvious the agenda will be distorted. This Mr Balderstone is the one and the same who wrote in approving terms of the environmental terrorist organisation `Earth First'. In case people want to doubt it, it is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Simply Living</EMPHASIS> in volume 2, No. 12, commencing at page 30. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Earth First' is an organisation that spikes trees, causing damage not only to machines but to people, and also sabotages machinery. As stated in the editorial part of the column by Simon Balderstone, the top adviser on environmental matters to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when discussing this issue and talking of his interview with Mr Foreman, the founder of the `Earth First' movement in the United States, and the way that these people campaign:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And unless anyone is directly injured as a result of an Earth First! piece of `ecotage', he has a very good argument.</PARA>
<PARA>And listeners ought to be aware that `ecotage' is the way that extremist Greens refer to sabotage. Let me just repeat that: Mr Balderstone said that, unless anyone is directly injured as a result of an `Earth First' piece of ecotage, he, Mr Foreman, has a very good argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pose a very simple question: what about indirect injury? By implication, Mr Balderstone, the senior adviser on environmental matters to the Prime Minister and this government, is saying that indirect injury to forest workers is okay in the defence of the forests. That person is employed by the Prime Minister. As a little aside, I ask a hypothetical question of the media&mdash;and of course it is completely hypothetical. Let us imagine if our former Leader of the Opposition, Alexander Downer, had addressed a League of Rights meeting; how would the media have treated that&mdash;such a terrible organisation? Of course, that question is purely hypothetical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the media knows about Simon Balderstone and his commitment to `Earth First'; that he works for the Prime Minister and has not been dismissed from that office. But where has the media been on this issue? Where has the media been? Other than for John Laws and Glenn Milne, there has been a conspiracy of silence perpetrated by the media. All I ask of the media is that, if they are going to treat somebody like Alexander Downer in the way they did just because he happened to address a League of Rights meeting, surely they ought to deal with other extremist groups in exactly the same way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a pathetically attended rally in Hobart yesterday, organised by the greens, the assembled were invited to a little puppet show later that week&mdash;undoubtedly, to raise money for the greens. But I say to those people: if ever anyone wanted to watch a display of puppetry, they should have been in Canberra over the past weeks. There they would have been entertained by the Rolls Royce of all puppet shows. It was a four-act feature, highlighting the four different positions held by the government over the last seven weeks. The script, narration and cast were supplied by courtesy of the greens. The problem and the tragedy is that it was played out on the taxpayer funded stage of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The puppet show was a classic Punch and Judy between Ministers Beddall and Faulkner. We had Beddall starting off on the stage alone, allowing people to go about their normal business in the forests, except in 85 coupes. Then at the other end of the stage, we see this hapless puppet of the green movement, now commonly referred to as Forrest Gump, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), regurgitating his lines which had been scripted by the greens. The narrative had been written by the greens, and 1,300 coupes were to be taken from the people. Punch and Judy&mdash;or Beddall and Faulkner, in this case&mdash;had their predictable punch up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So along came Mr Plod, the policeman, trying to restore order to this scene of domestic violence. But Mr Plod, alias the Prime Minister, was being pulled about on strings by none other than Simon Balderstone, to whom I have referred earlier, who comes from the Prime Minister's own office. So the Prime Minister, in his role of Mr Plod, tried to settle the domestic and announced that only 509 coupes were to be taken from the people of Australia and given to the greens. The high farce of that decision has now been exposed. As to those 509 coupes, when counted, there were 511. In our state of Tasmania, out of the 72 coupes on the list, 12 that ended up in the 511 were not even on the original list of 1,300. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Acting Deputy President and the Senate would be aware, the East Timor situation has been a running sore in foreign policy for 20 years&mdash;the invasion of East Timor being in 1975. Over that 20 years, there have been many notable peaks that have gained high public profile in the Australian press. The accusations in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> against the Suharto family's wealth was one of those peaks that angered our nearest northern neighbour, Indonesia. The Dili massacre in 1991 was another one of those notable peaks gaining public profile. The issue has not gone away over the 20 years, regardless of the Prime Minister's claim last year on his travels that this is a 1970s issue that is over and done with. It is far from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media has played a vital role in keeping Timor on the agenda. That probably has much to do with the unsolved murders of the television camera crew in 1975. As reported last year, they were grotesque murders. They were not killed by a bullet to the back of the head&mdash;the murderers went further than that. The issue has peaked again in today's paper, if anyone has read the paper. </PARA>

I visited Portugal last year and met with many representatives to talk about this matter of East Timor. In fact, I met the parliamentary committee overseeing East Timor. It was their summer break but the full committee came to meet me. I was quite taken aback and even offended by the Portuguese bile and insults towards Australia at that meeting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are a lot more hot-blooded and vicious about this issue than what I had originally thought. Of course, it is now all coming out in the international court. I do not want to dwell on the point as I have other points to make. However, the bile, as it has been described in the newspapers, does not surprise me. I think it is unnecessary and I do not think Australia deserves that form of attack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into the intricacies of the case or the history of the whole dispute, Australia really needs to update its argument for the court and show some really concrete results that its foreign policy has brought to the issue. After all, Senator Evans walks into this parliament time and again and at question time, in answer to the Democrats, really pleads with us just to wait and see that this even-handed approach will have a greater effect than the approach the international community is taking, no less the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to put on the table the concrete results of our foreign policy position. But it does seem that the argument  from Senator Tate in the international court has begun and ended with no more than a condemnation of Portugal's colonial role&mdash;that old hackneyed argument. It truly needs to be updated. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Greg Sheridan runs that argument and nothing more&mdash;nothing more than an attack on the Portuguese colonial role. Now for the very lazy observer it is always the first and only argument used to defend Indonesia's invasion of East Timor. There is no other argument put forward as to why Indonesia had a right to invade East Timor than that the Portuguese were lousy colonists. I am not going to defend the Portuguese role in East Timor&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look, I think they would concede that after 400 years they could have done more, but that is not relevant to today. It has nothing to do with justifying Indonesia's invasion and subsequent human right atrocities since then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Portuguese, in coming to the most current, modern-day defence of the East Timorese, do not seek to re-colonise East Timor&mdash;they do not seek sovereign rule of the East Timorese people. Rather, they seek the self-determination of the East Timorese people. So what is the point of running the line that they were lousy colonists when today all Portugal wants is that the East Timorese have self-determination and are independent of Indonesia? Whatever the past sins of the Portuguese, they are today doing the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as Australia pontificates on the Portuguese role, it forgets to mention that the Timorese people themselves seek the defence and support of the Portuguese. They do not want Indonesian rule. They do not support Australia's position. They want the Portuguese to carry out their defence in the international courts and in other arenas such as the United Nations. So the very people that we are debating about seek the comfort and support of the Portuguese people. They do not want to be in the Indonesian camp. I think that is a pretty potent argument to say that Portugal does have a legitimate role in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the argument run by Greg Sheridan is another tired old one which, by the way, is all pre-1975. Both arguments are pre-1975. He runs the argument that the Fretilin group was a communist group out of control. Again, I will not go into the intricacies of that claim except to say that that needs new analysis. The Cold War has collapsed. That is no longer a relevant argument. It was once an argument run against the ANC or the IRA. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Still true today. That is another debate. No, Senator Sherry, that is still true today. If Senator Sherry had his way and did not have the pressures and realities of the market he would be a tired old socialist. The point is that there is laziness of debate on this issue and the debate needs to be upgraded. By the way, that applies not just to Senator Sherry's side of the house, but to this side of the House also. There are too many lazy politicians who trump out the old `They were communists and they were bad colonists.' They are all pre-1975 issues and, with the collapse of the Cold War and the fact that East Timorese people want the Portuguese to play a role, I just cannot see how they are a defence. Yet that is the defence and, it seems, the only defence we are running in the international court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, the East Timorese certainly have more friends on this issue than Australia has. They have got the support of the United Nations, they have got the support of the European Community and they have got the support of the United States Congress and Senate. They do not only have the support of the former Democrat held Congress and Senate, they also have the support of the Republican Congress and Senate of today. They have got a lot more friends than Australia has on this issue, so again I cannot see how that argument stands up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that the Indonesians have done more structurally for East Timor is also very dubious. It does require a visit to East Timor to verify that, and I do not think there have been enough visits to East Timor to be able to verify it. Besides, any asphalt road may be of more benefit to transporting the military than the people; because East Timor still has a great number of people living at a subsistence level. An asphalt road does not repay the people for physical oppression and the oppression of their spirit of freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two matters have arisen from the Australian defence in the International Court of Justice. The fact that we ran our case and our arguments past the Indonesian government seems to have galled everyone in today's papers. By the way, I happen to support the Australian case in the International Court of Justice. That might surprise the likes of Senator Sherry, but I happen to think we have a right to explore the Timor Gap oil fields. We often go into joint explorations. We have done it with the Chinese and the Vietnamese. BHP is in Vietnam. It is our sovereign area, and there is no argument with that. I have no argument in taking up the cause of the East Timorese in our trade relations with the Indonesians. I hope that the judgment is favourable to Australia. But it seems that both sides, with all their bile, have taken it further than the commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that before we even turned up to The Hague we ran our case past the Indonesians was colourfully described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> today as `boot-licking'. Most Australians would know what that would mean. It seems to fit the pattern of the present Australian foreign policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indonesia is not the other party. Can we not stand alone? Can we not even go to an international court, put up our case and have pride in our case without first running it past the Indonesian government? The question has to be asked: were there any points that the Indonesians did not agree with in the case? If there were, did we change anything? What sovereign right do they have to review our case before the international court? It is boot-licking at its best. I will read this from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>'s editorial:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Evans says that by providing Jakarta with our legal arguments "we wanted to be sure there was no misunderstanding by the Indonesians about the nature of our case and the way we were presenting it".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But given the Government's dismal track record in defence of East Timor's oppressed people, Jakarta should have no illusions about our true position.</PARA>
<PARA>I recommend that people buy the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> today and have a look at the cartoon on the editorial page. That really does sum up the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have not really got their minds focused on foreign policy; they have got other economic problems. But there is one thing Australians do not like, and that is boot-licking. If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, it is a duck; and this is boot-licking. This is so typical of the perception of the Indonesian authority over Australia. It may just be a perception, but it is a very strong perception, and it is very embarrassing before the international community. It certainly shows weak character from the government that it would think that it had to do this, and is it infinitely unpopular with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have left I would like quickly to mention the second notable point to come out of the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to highlight the importance of the momentous events that we saw last week in this parliament. Indeed, the entire parliament was under siege. It was momentous because angry voters proved to all of us that Australian democracy is alive and well, and effective. Timber workers and their families from rural and regional Australia came to Parliament House to express a variety of emotions to this government. We now have proof that we have a functioning and robust democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers and families in the forest industry are hurting. Their industry has lost 25,000 jobs since 1980, and they came to say to the Labor government last week that enough is enough. They came to say that they were not going to stand for the loss of any more jobs. It was their democratic right to come to the doors of the parliament, and inside and outside they made their case in a very orderly manner. It is to the credit of the organisers and of the people involved that they behaved so impeccably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the President of the Senate last week, after a day of clapping in response to some of my colleagues' speeches, asking the gallery not to clap. Right through that whole Question Time there was no clapping at all from the gallery. It showed that in a democracy we can have a situation where people who have a real grievance can come and actually put their case in a very powerful way, without any threats of violence or action. Their very presence was powerful and actually started to turn this government around from some of the inappropriate decisions it was making on forest policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were supported by industrial organisations like the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, which formed with the forest workers a coalition for action&mdash;action to have the national forest policy, which the government signed in 1992, adhered to. In the galleries of the Senate and outside the parliament they exerted subtle pressure to have their grievances heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me outline the extent of this democracy in action. Four thousand protesters from south-east New South Wales, Gippsland, in Victoria, Tasmania, northern New South Wales and Queensland attended. Three hundred and fifty trucks and hundreds of cars, buses and mini-buses also came. The size of their number and their persistence with their pamphlets and conversations with members and senators was very effective. On a number of occasions I went out there and spoke to them. Because of a back problem I was in considerable pain. Honourable senators would recall that the protesters had two picket lines, about 300 yards apart. One of them brought up a Pajero and drove me between the two picket lines. The very nature of the way in which they acted and reacted to what was going on was a great credit to them and to democracy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They turned the lawns of the parliament into a real bush carnival, with country music, sausage sizzles, chainsaw competitions and kids swimming in the fountain outside the parliament. Whole towns, such as Bombala and Orbost, closed business and came to Canberra to take part in this exercise of participatory democracy. Democracy Australian style, therefore, has come out of the towns and has come out of the bush in big trucks and in blue singlets. One of my Senate colleagues said on one of the days, particularly the day that Orbost came up, that what he saw out there was very moving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This blockade is not just a tactic. It is part of the democratic process, and it is part of a process which between elections is something we hope will make the Labor government stick to its election promises. The forest industry and the families that support it have a lot at stake&mdash;thousands of jobs and an industry worth $450 million. As the Labor government has reneged on the national forest policy statement signed only three years ago, they feel cheated by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many supporters of the ALP went on voting for the ALP in the last election thinking that this forest policy not only protected the old-growth forest areas but also provided them with resource security and therefore with jobs. We are dealing with a government that does not even know the definition of `old-growth forest'. I have heard that the department of the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) has one definition and the department of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Faulkner) has another definition. I believe that both of these definitions are completely different from what was agreed in the forest policy statement of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can people trust a government that, internally, is disagreeing with itself, running two or maybe three totally separate agendas as it tries to appease different interest groups which support it? Compared with what the government promised at the election, it has done nothing short of electorate fraud. When we get to the ballot box next time I am sure the workers will not overlook it. The government even got support for their cause from the trade union movement. The President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, called on the Labor government to develop a decent industry policy covering Australian forest products. This is not an issue that came up on the lawns last week. I can remember it being an issue as far back as 1968. The government has been here 12 years, yet it is still muddling around, fighting internally and trying to come up with a policy that works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has called for assurances from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the jobs of these timber workers will be safe. This Labor cabinet is on notice to keep faith with the voters on fundamental promises like forest policy and resource security. Any government needs to make policy changes at the margins as changes occur, but outright electoral fraud and deception will bring back the people who encircled this parliament last week if the government does not get its act together and get this policy straight. The arrogance of this Labor government has been dramatically challenged, not only within this parliament but outside the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. We have read in the newspapers that the initial cabinet submission on the so-called carbon taxes contained a range of proposals. I think they were your submissions, Senator McMullan. One was a tax of $1.25 a tonne on carbon dioxide emission to raise $960 million over three years. Another was to raise $1.3 billion over three years. Since neither option will significantly reduce emission rates, doesn't this demonstrate that the motive for additional fuel taxes is simply revenue raising, not protection of the environment at all? Or is it the intention of the government to substantially increase the tax take after introduction as it has done with both the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not be surprising to anyone&mdash;even someone from Mars, which is the way the opposition sometimes behaves&mdash;who was been following the debate that the government is considering a range of options to address the greenhouse emissions target. Australia was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the framework convention on climate change. A major element of that ratification was the national greenhouse response strategy which did contain an interim planning target to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions at 1988 levels by the year 2000 and to reduce those emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005. That interim planning target was endorsed by the states and by the Commonwealth within a no regrets framework.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, of course it is the case that the government is considering a range of greenhouse measures. Those measures have been thought about and further developed over the course of the last eight months. It is the case that a small environment levy&mdash;and I emphasise the word small&mdash;not designed in any way to be a revenue measure is one of the many options that are on the table. Those options will be considered in the lead-up to the conference of the parties to the framework convention on climate change in Berlin in March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No decision has yet been made to introduce an environment levy of any kind. A judgment will be made by the government as to an appropriate mix of policy instruments, including the possibility of a levy, after full consideration of the views of all those interested. There is, of course, an enormous interest in this matter from Australian industry which does stand to suffer some disbenefits as a result of any swingeing imposition of a tax or a levy in this particular area. We will certainly be considering those arguments and we will certainly be considering the costs and benefits of other alternative strategies for greenhouse gas emissions for Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of different models that have been employed by researchers to assess the impact of a carbon tax of any kind or any level on emissions as well as on revenue. The estimated impact of any such tax would obviously depend on the design of the tax and the assumptions about behavioural responses that are employed. That is the background; that is the foreground; that is the beginning and the end of it. The government has made no decision. We are very conscious that you cannot go down the track of revenue raising in this particular area, as distinct from other policy objectives, without having adverse policy consequences for an industry whose recovery we do want to sustain. The government will, as always, behave with complete responsibility in its approach to this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. It relates to the issue of United States export subsidies, and specifically those on dairy products. This is a matter that has attracted considerable media interest and industry concern in this country. It is apparent that these subsidies cost Australian farmers millions of dollars in lost export revenue, but, as you have already mentioned in the parliament, the subsidies also represent a major cost to taxpayers in the United States. That view was repeated only this morning on radio. Minister, in this regard can you explain further to the Senate what the effects of these export subsidies will be on United States taxpayers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan. What happened this morning was very important. For a long time Australian government and industry and parliamentary representatives of all parties have been telling the United States administration that their export subsidy programs on dairy and grains are very opposed to our interests and articulating that, but also saying that it is not even in their intelligent self-interest&mdash;not their taxpayers, not their consumers and not even the efficient sectors of their agriculture industry. But we have always known that such an argument would have much more impact inside the United States when effective United States advocacy of those issues emerged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For what, I think, is about the first time today we heard a representative of United States consumers through the Nader organisation speaking out on the need to drastically cut back on the money poured into these programs. They said on ABC radio this morning, quite correctly, that these programs represented a major diversion of US taxpayers' money away from the pressing social problems to the coffers of large international corporations both American and foreign. They claimed that the United States administration is throwing money at these international corporations, and they are fundamentally right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent case of the subsidised US sales of skim milk powder to Australia's key markets in Asia provides a graphic example. The subsidy was 8,000 metric tonnes of skim milk powder. Firstly, they subsidised $100 a tonne more than was necessary to make the sales. They forced the price down. The dairy industry's advice to us and to the US government was that they could have made the sale with a subsidy of $100 less. That is a waste of about $800,000 of US taxpayers' money&mdash;that is US dollars, about $1 million Australian. But it gets worse. Consistent with the Nader organisation's story, trade sources tell us that it was not even United States trading companies that picked up this windfall gain&mdash;it was a European company, what was explained to me as a `large Swiss dairy company'&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not say who it was. It traded the subsidised US products and made a profit, the United States taxpayers' money going straight into that company. It is not that company's fault. They would be silly not to do it. You cannot blame them. Somebody came along with a cheque and they took it. You would be a mug not to take it. But you would be a mug to offer it. There is yet another downside for the United States. By artificially depressing the price in the Asian dairy market they are damaging the longer term prospects for their efficient dairy farmers such as those in California. It is not even in their own agriculture industry's long-term interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about all this is that we have a big message to sell in the United States but it will be much more effectively done now that the voice of the United States consumer is starting to be heard. We will be reinforcing the argument that no government can rein in its budget deficit while it is wasting money in ways such as this. They cannot address their social equity issues while they are spending their money on priorities like this. They undermine their efficient industries while they do it. It is a classic vicious cycle because, as they undermine their efficient industries they have to subsidise more, the equity problem gets worse, the efficient industries suffer more and they have to subsidise even more. This is the message we will be trying to put through directly and with the other countries of the Cairns Group. It is a very good year to do it because it is a year when there is a lot of deficit pressure in the United States and it is the Farm Bill year. We will be putting a lot of pressure, with the Australian industry, on the Farm Bill right throughout this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me wish Senator McMullan luck in his venture. My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer to the environmental tax presently under discussion by the government and ask: since an environmental tax will impose extra costs on industry, including primary industry, putting them at a disadvantage in international markets, will the assessment of the tax also take into account the efficient absorption of carbon dioxide by plants and crops, for example, in the forestry industry and the sugar crop, which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it produces? Considering that the tax has always been directed at the greenhouse gas emission levies and that your colleague Senator McMullan believes it should only be raised based on greenhouse merits, and if this were a genuine environmental measure, not simply another revenue raiser, would this not mean there should also be a system of greenhouse credits&mdash;and then some Australian farmers could expect to receive a cheque rather than a tax bill?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions I have provided the Senate with details of the process that the government is engaged in to develop its next phase of response on the greenhouse gas emission issue. Let us be clear about this once and for all: the government is still in the process of developing its position. I outlined this in an answer earlier in the week when Senator Margetts asked me what the government's position was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, options are on the table. I think that is very appropriate. I also believe it is appropriate that the government discuss these options with interested stakeholders. To that end, I, Senator Cook, Senator McMullan, Senator Collins and Mr Beddall held discussions yesterday with environment and other community groups and today with industry and trade union groups about their views on what would be an appropriate response for the government to the very important issue of reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, this morning the second of those ministerial round table discussions was held. I believe that those round table discussions have provided an excellent opportunity for the key stakeholders to present their positions on what would be an appropriate response directly to government. I believe&mdash;certainly this feedback has come from those who have participated in the round table discussions&mdash;that the organisations appreciate that opportunity. They did talk about the issue of a greenhouse levy and a range of other options. This morning we heard about new possible no regrets measures that could be developed by government to enhance our greenhouse response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful to have an opportunity to listen to the views of the proponents of various cases. Ministers have been able to signal their interest in receiving a range of additional information on these issues. Ministers have also signalled their willingness to hold quite a number of bilateral discussions with the stakeholders. I might mention to Senator Boswell that we have already had a significant number of bilateral discussions, including with representatives from the National Farmers Federation who have indicated a genuine and particular interest in some of the specific matters that he raises in his question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has involved itself in a consultative process. We have indicated our willingness to take into account the views of interested parties. If we did not consult, talk and listen to the views of stakeholders and interest groups, we would be criticised. Senator Boswell would be the first person on his feet to condemn the government for not talking to those who have a view to make clear. I can say this: the government is committed to having an effective greenhouse response that will consist of an integrated package of measures. We will continue to work through the options. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. The minister would be aware of my interest in the welfare of Australians who are held in foreign prisons. In this regard, I have become aware of schemes which many countries have in place to allow international prisoners to be transferred to their home countries and serve their sentences there. Against this background, is the minister able to inform the Senate of the current status of negotiations being undertaken with the states and territories to institute an Australian system of transfer for international prisoners, including both Australians held in foreign prisons and foreign nationals who are imprisoned in Australia? In particular, can the minister advise whether the necessary federal legislation to effect a transfer system is likely to be introduced this year and whether there is any expectation of how soon such a system could be operating in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston is quite right: I am well aware of his interest in this area. I think this is about the fourth or fifth question that he has asked me over the last two or so years and I can say to him that his interest in and support for an initiative in this area is starting to pay dividends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the Attorney-General that significant progress is being made in this area. There is now strong state government support for the federal government initiative for Australian participation in the international transfer of prisoners. The Commonwealth and all the state and territory governments, with the exception of the Northern Territory, have made a firm commitment to proceed with the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is well aware of the strong humanitarian and rehabilitative advantages and possible financial benefits of participating in international prisoner transfers. Such schemes have been operating quite well in other countries for some time and the matter is therefore being expedited as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had extensive consultations with the states and territories, and it should be recognised in this context that it is particularly important that states and territories are involved here since the services in question are those provided by state and territory governments and not by the Commonwealth government. As a result of these consultations there has been substantial and very pleasing progress. Agreement has now been reached on the scheme's core legislative and administrative details and Commonwealth and state and territory legislation is in the process of being developed. We anticipate that the Commonwealth legislation will be introduced in mid-1995, and present indications are that the states and territories will be able to progress their legislation at approximately the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General also notes that he is pleased with the cooperation and commitment of the states and territories in assisting the Commonwealth to progress the matter. He looks forward to further cooperation and the finalisation and implementation of an international prisoner transfer scheme and, with such cooperation, a prisoner transfer scheme may in fact be operating as early as 1996.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Evans in his capacity as both Minister representing the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. Given the admission of the minister for the environment that it is now impossible to meet the greenhouse targets of stabilisation at the 1990 levels by the year 2000 and a 20 per cent reduction below those levels by 2005, and given also the report of the Auditor-General that one year into the greenhouse gas reduction program the government's program was already one year behind, will the minister confirm that these, nonetheless, remain Australia's targets? Is the government attempting in any way whatsoever&mdash;here I use the same legalistic circumlocution which the minister loves&mdash;to influence other countries to water down greenhouse targets and/or is Australia seeking the international acceptance of a lesser target for Australia on the grounds that we are a fossil fuel producing and exporting country or on any other grounds?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that was a very unkind cut from Senator Coulter about circumlocution. I am always very precise and direct on these occasions. In fact, I will be impolitely precise and direct at the outset and say that Senator Coulter unfortunately seems to have muddled his statement of the targets. The domestic interim planning target is a reduction to not 1990 but 1988 levels by the year 2000 and with a 20 per cent reduction by 2005. The target implied in the convention is stabilisation at 1990 levels by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the substance of his question, the government has acknowledged, and continues to acknowledge, that on the basis of current programs and projections Australia will not be able to fully meet the stabilisation targets set out in either the  convention on climate change or the domestic interim planning target. For that reason, as I have already indicated in answer to an earlier question, the government proposes to consider soon a package of further measures that will improve the level of Australia's performance and carry us closer to our objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that Australia is by no means the only country in this situation. Quite a number of others in the OECD, for a start, are unlikely to meet the targets and will need to consider further steps. Countries in this category include the United States, Canada, Japan and a number of member states of the European Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the Senate, however, that the targets remain operative for us, as indeed do all relevant provisions of the convention on climate change. Australia is certainly not trying to influence other countries to reduce the targets contained in the convention. Likewise, we are not seeking a lesser target for Australia on the grounds that Australia is a fossil fuel producing and exporting country. In this regard, however, I should point out that the convention provides, quite correctly in our view, that parties shall take into consideration the situation of parties with economies that are highly dependent on fossil fuels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we are not seeking to water down existing targets, we are adopting a considered approach to the question of new commitments which takes into account the range and diversity of Australia's interests. As we approach the conference of the parties on the convention, which is to take place in Berlin at the end of March/early April, our approach to proposals for strengthening commitments is this: in the first place, it would be premature to consider further proposals until parties have agreed on the principles on which further negotiation should be based and the procedures for conducting such negotiations&mdash;that is a necessary basis for acceptable and effective outcomes; secondly, negotiations by the parties on a protocol should not begin until after this first conference of the parties; and, thirdly, further international action should be based on equitable burden sharing arrangements and on greater involvement over time of developing countries. Australia's aim continues to be the achievement of an effective and equitable convention which will deal with global environmental problems of climate change while, at the same time, protecting our economic, trade and foreign policy interests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I can say that the story that appeared in the press as a result of a press statement by Senator Chapman is without foundation. There has never been any proposal to have secret Russian rocket launches from Australia. I suspect Senator Chapman went back to the 1950s and sought a reds under the bed style of statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening is that the Australian Space Office and the Australian Space Council have presented a report to the government outlining the possibility of launching from Australia certain types of rockets on a commercial basis and involving Australian industry. This was part of their five-year program which they presented to the government in accordance with legislation carried by this parliament with support from both sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of those discussions by the Australian Space Office, Russian interests&mdash;in particular, two Russian companies: STC Complex and Energomash, a Russian rocket producer and a Russian rocket engineer manufacturer respectively&mdash;have indicated strong interest in looking at Australia's capability to launch rockets, particularly in view of the open space we have and our geographical position in the world, to see whether there would be suitable opportunities with which they would like to be involved. They have indicated that they have access to many rockets that have been now made available because of the nuclear disarmament treaties that Russia has signed with the United States and that some of those rockets can now be used for peaceful purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that indication, the Australian Space Office and Space Council will be conducting a study with the Russians about the possibility of having these rockets launched from Australia. That study will be done in conjunction with an industry reference group from Australia so that Australian industry is fully able to participate in any such program that may eventuate. I emphasise that this whole process will be led and controlled by the Australian Space Office and nothing will be entered into unless Australia's sovereignty and Australia's international obligations are fully met and there is no compromise to them. I believe these studies will take up to the middle of this year to complete. I hope by the middle or latter part of this year to be able to report to parliament that those studies have been successful, but we will have to await their outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far there has generally been bipartisan support for the development of Australian space activity going back to the Senate transport committee report of some years ago. It was very unfortunate that Senator Chapman&mdash;for purposes I suspect more related to his preselection opportunities or chances in South Australia a week ago&mdash;put out a bizarre statement saying that we would be involved in allowing any country, let alone Russia, to carry out secret launches from Australia. I want to put on the record that that is a bizarre suggestion with no foundation. We will continue to work with the Russians and with the American interest and any other country that wants to have an open and transparent discussion with Australia about developing rocket launching facilities within Australia.</PARA>

Nor will it give consideration to any revenue measure of any kind until a long way further down the track when we have got a full read-out on what the precise budgetary targets are; the extent to which we are able to meet them by a rational response on outlays reduction and asset sales; and what the residual targets as a result are.

If these promises are real, are you going to simply add to the outlays and add to the size of the deficit with all the macro-economic responsibility thereby implied?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth's constitutional capacity to actually control timber policy or forest policy in this area is obviously limited. The export control power, regulations under the trade and commerce power, are obviously important but that power cannot be decisive given the fact that most of the value extracted from forests is not in the form of exported woodchips but rather non-exported logs and other timber products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, the truth of the matter is that the government has to rely upon a cooperative strategy with the states if sensible policy results are to be achieved. It is that cooperative approach with the states that the Commonwealth is committed to rather than trying to use Commonwealth powers to manage what is quintessentially a state responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main aim of the Prime Minister's statements has been to exclude, as you know, future logging from high conservation value native forests and, at the same time, encourage the development of a truly sustainable and value added wood products industry. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, it is state governments who have primary responsibility for forest management with the Commonwealth's powers in this area being limited to very indirect control mechanisms such as approval for export licences for that proportion of the forest product which is in fact exported, which is the minority of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to put this on record again in this place because this government's record on families is unmatched but it often goes unknown and overlooked. I make it clear that our policies are comprehensive in income support for families of all ages&mdash;from families with children through to families caring for frail and disabled relatives. The other thing we have done during our time in office is make sure those payments are regularly reviewed so we can make sure that they are most appropriately targeted and most appropriate and efficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing to recognise is that the income support we provide for families is provided within both the social welfare and the social justice frameworks&mdash;our policies in Medicare, in education, in housing including the introduction of rent assistance, and in expanded superannuation coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most important thing to have assisted families with income support is the creation of over 1.8 million jobs since we came into office. In particular, looking at payments for families, I mention the very significant stages of, firstly, benchmarking payments to families on behalf of children and, secondly, indexing them. All family payments by this government are indexed. Particularly the additional family payment, as it is now called, has been of huge benefit to families of Australia. Those payments have increased since we came into office by 83 per cent and 157 per cent, depending on whether that family payment is to children between 0 and 13 years or 13 and 16 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, for the first time ever we have actually indexed all those family payments and in 1987 we introduced rent assistance to low income families. By way of flexibility of payments, too, in 1993 we allowed the basic family payment to be taken as a lump sum for the projected six months. Particularly, this is something families have enjoyed in January and February as they face the extra costs that come at that time in helping get children back to school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see that the cost of community services and Medicare is assessed at about $67 to $70 per week for low income families. There have been some alternative proposals for how you help with family income support. There is, for example, a proposal from Mr Prosser for a multibillion dollar universal age pension, but at the same time we have an opposition finance spokesperson calling for cuts in welfare costs. So how do you deal with a family income support program that on the one hand wants to dramatically increase the expenditure and on the other wants very much to restrict welfare cuts? There is nothing but contradiction and hypocrisy there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important point to have a look at is the family income support as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, who is favouring a return to income splitting.

That review is now taking place. It will be completed and a report made to me by the middle of this year. You and anybody else who wants to make a comment about the operation of the tariff concession system are quite able to make such a submission. If you want to make one, you will make one, and so be it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not agree with your premise that the tariff concession order automatically is costing Australian industry opportunities. The tariff concession order operates to provide Australian industry with the opportunity to import goods, particularly capital goods that are not already made in Australia or, where they are able to be imported, to provide an opportunity to develop an Australian industry. There is a proper and detailed process laid down in legislation by this parliament as to how those concession orders are applied and how they are investigated. They are not interfered with in the political process by ministers; they are applied by officers in accordance with the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is open and transparent. Anybody who feels that they have not been successful in their particular case can appeal to the Federal Court&mdash;and many do&mdash;and the court will, in the end, decide whether they have a case or not. So I think that the premise you raise, that there is something untoward about the system, is just not correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also point out that many of the items that are imported under the tariff concession orders go into capital investment for Australian manufacturing in particular, and become part of value added export industries. So, in effect, in the long run they improve the current account deficit rather than being a detriment to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this does not accord with your view generally about what we should be doing with tariffs, but that is the case. Many of the applications for tariff concession orders are for capital goods that add to the productivity of Australian industries and make them internationally competitive when they become exporters. You asked about the duty forgone; I am advised by Customs that in 1994 it was approximately $630 million on the tariff concession order&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which is a fair amount of money, I certainly agree. However, we do not see that as a loss of straight-out revenue. We see that, in terms of the tariff concession order and in policy terms, as enabling Australian industries to get capital goods, in particular, at the cheapest possible rate so that they can become internationally competitive. Though it may be a loss of $630 million in terms of revenue, there are many benefits in accordance with government policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on one point: in my many visits to small and medium size enterprises over the last couple of years&mdash;particularly in the manufacturing sector&mdash;I have come across many small businesses who are in favour of no tariffs. They want to be able to import some of their semi-processed raw inputs. They want to be able to import their capital equipment at the cheapest possible price, which makes them internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is now a growing culture in Australia to be world best, internationally competitive and not rely on high tariffs or quotas as we have in the past.

The last thing they want to have to do is to get into this debate, because none of them want to defend Senator Faulkner either. We know what they have said in cabinet. We know that anything they say now for the public record will hurt them very dearly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We move this censure motion very seriously and with a touch of sadness, because the minister has shown that he is completely incapable of retaining his place in a government that is supposed to be governing for the whole of Australia. If the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had any guts, he would stand up to the Left of his party and would have sacked Senator Faulkner long ago for the complete farce and debacle that this whole process is. Mr President, they are not my words; they are the words of your colleague from Western Australia, former Senator Walsh, who calls this matter and Senator Faulkner's handling of it a complete debacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only the coalition is saying this. The Greens, for different reasons, agree that Senator Faulkner has been completely incompetent in this matter. The unionists, who the Labor Party are supposed to support and who want jobs, and the forest workers are not the only ones saying this. Senator Faulkner's caucus colleagues are also saying it. If Laurie Oakes and Glen Milne are to be believed at all&mdash;there are plenty of leakers in the Labor caucus, including Senator Collins, who are only too keen to run to Glen Milne and Laurie Oakes&mdash;we will know that the majority of the Labor caucus also agrees with us in what we say about Senator Faulkner's administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner has earned the contempt of his party, which knows that it will be struggling in the next election. As my colleague Senator Alston has said previously, Senator Faulkner set out to be Graham Richardson but has ended up being Ros Kelly. Senator Faulkner is no Graham Richardson. The only similarity he shares with Richo is his view on the virtue of telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate: for what purpose has this fiasco gone on? Senator Faulkner's department is running a particular agenda. I am pleased to see the support that he is getting from his colleagues. It lends truth to my point about their being embarrassed. We can see that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner's department is not working on a whole of government policy. It is not working in the best interests of the whole of Australia but for what suits its jaundiced view of the world and the jaundiced view of certain officers in it. How could this minister appoint Mr Toyne to give an objective view of government processes? The processes are all wrong. We understand this when we hear Mr Keating calling the Wilderness Society a Nazi front or a Goebbels organisation. Mr Toyne is very close to the Wilderness Society, yet Senator Faulkner has engaged him as the deputy secretary of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner has so demeaned the process that the whole conservation movement is suffering. The whole environmental situation in our country has suffered because of the incompetence of this minister trying to be too smart by half. Any action now taken by the minister or the department will be viewed with suspicion because this whole process has been so absolutely stupid that no-one will ever again trust anything this minister or the department do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate to contemplate what would have happened if Mr Beddall had asked NAFI or the sawmillers to assess the coupes and had paid them $120,000 of taxpayers' money to do that. What would Australians have said, what would Senator Faulkner have said, what would the environment movement have said if the government had paid $120,000 in taxpayers' money to get the sawmillers, the unionists and the NAFI people to assess the coupes? There would have been complete outrage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somehow this minister snuck the money out of his own budget so that he did not have to go to cabinet, so that Senator Collins and Mr Beddall would not have a chance to stop it. Senator Faulkner paid out of his own department's budget $120,000 plus of taxpayers' money for four conservation groups to tell us what is in these coupes, things that Senator Faulkner's own department could have got out of the state department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the $120,000 that they got, these conservation groups have not even walked over the coupes that they have given an assessment on. They have not ground truthed them, whatever that might mean. Even though we gave Senator Faulkner 24 hours notice to tell us which of those coupes had been walked over, had been physically looked at, today Senator Faulkner simply could not tell us. I suspect the answer is that very few of them, if any at all, were walked over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this is the process that Senator Faulkner has described as rigorous. He said that it is a marvellous process&mdash;that it is rigorous, consultative, open, transparent, and, I believe, that it withstands scrutiny. It withstands scrutiny and he cannot even tell us whether the coupes were looked at. Senator Faulkner also said those areas have outstanding conservation attributes such as old growth values and wilderness values, yet his highly paid consultants did not even bother, in most instances, to have a look at them. That is the process that Senator Faulkner is trying to tell us is rigorous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Laurie Oakes has pointed out, because of what Senator Faulkner has done he has given Justice Sackville and the courts the opportunity to not only throw out woodchip exports but also put into jeopardy exports of coal, aluminium, uranium and mineral sands. That is, of course, why the Labor caucus is so furious with Senator Faulkner&mdash;he has brought into jeopardy not only woodchip exports but also exports of many other things which Australia requires to try to balance the foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia suffers the Labor Party plays its vicious little political game. We all know, because Senator Richardson told us on his last day, that he did not speak to Senator Faulkner for all of the time that they were in the parliament together until the last day. Why was that? It is because Senator Faulkner comes from the Left and Senator Richardson came from the Right. They would not even speak to each other for four years in this parliament. That is what this is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson said that in his farewell speech, Senator Collins. Senator Richardson would not even talk to him. Senator Ray sits next to Senator Faulkner, and we can see from this side that, when Senator Faulkner is answering these questions, Senator Ray looks as though he wishes he were up in one of his Blackhawk helicopters. Even though they are about to crash, he would still rather be there than sitting next to Senator Faulkner when Senator Faulkner tries to justify this. We can see from here, Senator Collins, that every time Senator Faulkner is asked a question you always find something very important to talk about to Senator McMullan. Every single time we have asked Senator Faulkner a question, you have looked the other way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have a look at the lefties on the other side, you can see that they are genuinely very sorry for the way that their man has mishandled this. Senator Devereux is in fact so sorry that he even resigned from the Labor Party. We all know, because we saw it on television, that Mr Beddall and Senator Faulkner had a stand-up fight in Hobart. Everybody saw that. These are the two people who are supposed to be running the forest policy. They were almost at fisticuffs at Hobart before Simon Balderstone pulled them apart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is how the Labor Party runs its policy. It is all this Left-Right fighting&mdash;who is going to get ascendancy. We heard about it from Hobart. We only have to look at Port Hinchinbrook to see another instance of it. The Goss Labor government&mdash;part of Mr Beddall's faction, I might say&mdash;approved the development at Port Hinchinbrook. What did Senator Faulkner do? He came along and stopped it&mdash;not for any true conservation reason, because we know that there is an environmental disaster up there at the moment, but because Senator Faulkner wanted to pay back Mr Beddall and the Queensland right wing faction from knocking off the left wing President of the Labor Party in Queensland. That is what it is all about. Here we are, with these major issues before the Australian people, and the Labor Party, urged on or led by Senator Faulkner, is simply playing a stupid factional game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the way Senator Faulkner could not administer his contracts and for the way he misled the Senate yesterday, he should be sacked. For that reason alone, this censure motion deserves to be passed. A few days ago Senator Faulkner told us that `all of the acquittal processes have been dealt with'. He said, `I have them. They've all been properly acquitted.' Yet yesterday, when he was required by an order of the Senate to table not only certain information but those acquittals, he said, `I can't do it,' in spite of the fact that a couple of days before he said he had them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very important point to this: not only did Senator Faulkner mislead the Senate but he has failed to account to this Senate and to the people of Australia for the way that $120,000 was spent. It makes us wonder, senator, just what that money was spent on. We know that the dark green conservation movement has been propped up by the Labor Party with government grants for the last few years. You know that that is done for purely political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, you are probably glad I am saying this because you probably think that this will put the green conservation movement on side this time when you are about to lose its support. I tell you this, senator: the people of Australia are getting a bit sick of you using taxpayers' money to prop up a political grouping in the dark green conservation movement to campaign for you people every election time. I can tell you that the people of Australia are getting very sick and tired of that. Again, this is simply what has happened with that $120,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invited you, senator, to explain to us yesterday why the acquittals could not be put in, and you gave me some tripe about it not being the right time for the acquittals. Yet, the contracts clearly say that their completion date is 4 November and that the acquittals will be all audited by auditors within eight weeks of 4 November. That is somewhere around the beginning of January. But here we are, in the middle of February, and you do not have them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why haven't you got them? I don't know, but it makes the people of Australia very suspicious that perhaps there cannot be any proper acquittal for that $120,000. So for that alone you should be censured. You should be censured for the incompetent way you have handled this whole process and for the divisions you have brought in an industry that can be worth so much to Australia. You have completely demeaned the conservation process. You have demeaned the process for those of us who have a genuine interest and concern in conservation and in the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have cost the jobs of hundreds and hundreds of hard-working Australians who want to get work and to do it in an environmentally friendly way. For all of those things, we cannot forgive you; but, more importantly, neither can your own caucus members. They cannot forgive you either. It is for this reason that the Senate should pass the censure motion and make Senator Faulkner realise that we cannot simply tolerate this incompetence, this fiasco, this debate. Hopefully Mr Keating will then do the right thing and tell Senator Faulkner that he has to stand aside. </PARA>

It was the 1993 decision of the cabinet that I should advise the Minister for Resources on the applicability of the national forest policy statement to the woodchip licence renewal process. That advice was prepared in a manner completely consistent with the national forest policy statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key element of that policy is that old growth and wilderness areas of high conservation value should be protected until their values are assessed and until it is determined whether or not they are required for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. That is entirely consistent with the precautionary principle. But, of course, I do not think opposition senators would know a lot about the precautionary principle. Even if they did know about it I suspect they would never ascribe to it anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say that the approach I have taken is very consistent with commonsense. It would make sense to very few people to continue to log areas you believed were of high conservation value while you discussed processes to assess those areas. Surely it would make more sense to protect them until their values could be thoroughly assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made it clear that the assessment processes conducted by my portfolio were hampered by a lack of cooperation from state forestry agencies and a number of other relevant stakeholders. I must say that I did everything possible to achieve their cooperation. I informed all my relevant state counterparts of my initiative to assess areas likely to be of high conservation value and I invited their participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early November I sent the reports that were prepared by the conservation organisations to the state governments, to NAFI, to the CFMEU and to the Forest Protection Society. Only Western Australia provided any analysis in relation to the merits of individual coupe assessments. I could not, and I did not, accept that this lack of cooperation should prevent my department and portfolio agencies preparing the best advice possible under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the furphy that this was put forward on the back of an envelope by a few green radicals, which is the suggestion made by Senator Macdonald. The advice that I gave to Minister Beddall did not come from the conservation movement; it was not prepared by the conservation movement. The conservation councils, as required, provided an input&mdash;an important input&mdash;but only an input to the preparation of the department's advice. I believe there were 425 coupes and 11 forest blocks which the conservation groups included in their lists which were not supported by my department. The advice was prepared by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Australian Heritage Commission, the EPA and the forest branch of my department. It was prepared by people who I believe are competent, dedicated and professional public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The portfolio undertook its assessment of the conservation significance of the areas planned to be logged in a variety of ways. Perhaps I am not able to go through all the steps involved in the time available, but there were certainly a number of very significant steps.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Environment Resources Information Unit&mdash;ERIN, as it is better known&mdash;used technology to map the location of coupes with information holdings on nationally threatened species, including rare species of plants obtained from the records of museums, herbaria and botanical gardens around Australia. The Australian Nature Conservation Agency plotted the location of coupes against information holdings on rare and threatened species, rare and threatened communities, wetlands of significance and migratory paths of birds. ANCA also undertook a detailed analysis of the significance of places for the conservation of biological diversity, including an analysis at a national level of the importance of regions or areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation status of forest communities was checked by the portfolio against all available information. Where an area was considered to be poorly reserved, it was listed as likely to be of high conservation value. Analysis was also undertaken of the habitat requirements and strategies that needed to be put in place to protect species listed in the Endangered Species Protection Act. The Australian Heritage Commission also analysed the information against the national wilderness inventory. In places where the inventory is not complete, other assessments were used&mdash;notably, the New South Wales national parks and wildlife assessments of wilderness areas and the joint AHC-WA Department of Conservation and Land Management assessment in the southern forests of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The import of my advice was that the areas my portfolio had identified as likely to be of high conservation value should be protected until their values are assessed. A process is now in place which should allow an assessment to be completed in the course of the next two months. Those sitting on the opposition benches, forest experts to a man and woman&mdash;all of them absolute forest experts&mdash;do not need any help at all in assessing any advice on any of these issues.

Around 400 of the coupes on the list of 509 were assessed as having old-growth and wilderness values.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department provided grants to four conservation organisations to enable them to prepare a report justifying their views of High Conservation Values in forests in their respective States.</PARA>
<PARA>It outlines the moneys involved. The secretary has attached details of the time frame, as I indicated I would do, and the events surrounding these grants. I will table them soon. The minute states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have examined the four grants in question and measured them against:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. the existing rules and guidelines&mdash;the Secretary's instructions issued by me under the Finance Directions, my guidelines on "Standard Grant Approval Processes" and the Auditor-General's "Best Practice Guide for the Administration of Grants"; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.other grants administered by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to 1, I am satisfied that mandatory and appropriate processes have been complied within all four cases, that is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a formal grant agreement (copies of which have been made public);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.monitoring of performance specified in the agreement;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.follow-up in cases where time frames envisaged in the agreement have not been met (in relation to these two points, the Department accepted that the original time frame set out in the agreements could not be met, in part because of the difficulty in accessing information, and preferred to get complete reports rather than half-finished ones; in some cases where the information finally provided was not complete further work was urgently commissioned); and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.vigilant reminding of the grant recipients' obligation to acquit the grants within eight weeks of completion of the project (see for example the attached letter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I will also table that letter. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that in fact a seven week period from drawing final cheques was sought in these letters).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I draw your attention to the fact that work on the supplementary reports required in Tasmania, Victoria and NSW proceeded without signature of a variation to the original contract, I understand in light of the tight time frames. In two cases (Vic and NSW) the Councils have still not formally signed the variation. As payments have not been made in advance of this signature, the risk in these circumstances has been all the Councils'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As regards other grants administered by the Department, there is not a "typical" instance to measure these grants. This highlights the uniqueness of each case, and the discretion given to program managers to manage within the formal instructions. Some grants are paid totally in advance and others are paid as a mixture of advance and arrears, depending on the individual circumstances. I am satisfied that the circumstances surrounding these four cases led to appropriate and fully accountable processes being put in place for administration of the grants. In particular, requiring acquittal within eight weeks of final payments makes sense in this case, because the Department was signifying its acceptance that the contract had been met by that payment. Moreover until the groups received that payment they were not in a position to acquit the grant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That you note my assurance that proper accountability procedures have been followed and that the matters outstanding will be vigorously pursued.</PARA>
<PARA>I table those documents and reject the opportunistic, despicable and contemptible slurs that the opposition has levelled on me and officers of my department in relation to this matter. It is absolutely outrageous. You want to get up on your hind legs and apologise to all the people who are involved. You know you are wrong. Why don't you admit you are wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what you are doing is just trying to scrape the bottom of the barrel in relation to this particular matter. There is no contribution to and no interest at all in the fundamental issue that we have been debating in this parliament for two weeks; that is, the future of Australia's native forests and the future of the forest industries in this country. That is what it is all about. You have absolutely no contribution to make about those substantive issues&mdash;none at all. What you are doing and what you are saying represents nothing more or less than the most crass political opportunism it is possible to see in parliamentary politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular building was blockaded, as everyone knows, by a number of people protesting against what the government was doing. What did you do? You just incited all those people to come in here, interrupt and attend question time. I do not mind that. I do not mind that at all, but what I object to is the absolute hypocrisy when other people do it in the gallery. What do you do when a few greenies get up in the gallery? What do you do when people protesting about Aboriginal issues or the conflict in Iraq are up in the gallery? You go off your heads. You go berserk. You object. You claim that the Australian parliament is under threat and democracy is about to fall in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is hypocrisy, absolute hypocrisy. It is political opportunism of the worst kind. These appalling allegations from Senator Macdonald about the acquittal process are nothing more than the most baseless of smears and innuendo.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whatever you say and do over the next few days, you will not be able to convince the Australian people about your behaviour over this fortnight in parliament; your role will not be forgotten. What you have stood for&mdash;the logging of 509 coupes of high conservation value native forest, without a thought to the environmental consequences&mdash;is something that you will regret. I suspect also that you will regret the fact that the charge has been led by the shadow minister for environment and heritage, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). But that is something you will have to argue out in the future. You will have to argue why you do not believe it is important to achieve a balance between the protection of Australia's native forests and the jobs of workers in the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a difficult issue. We on this side of the chamber know it is a difficult issue; we have been grappling with it for well over a decade. But what do you do? You just opportunistically jump on the cart and see what you can do to get short-term political benefit out of the situation. But it will backfire on you. I can assure you that this great strategic political decision that you have made will turn into a festering sore for your parties: a festering sore for the Liberal Party&mdash;a festering sore on the rotting carcass of the opposition and the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I promise you that what you have said will not be forgotten: the fact that you are happy to see all these old-growth forests&mdash;these important remnants of forests for future generations of Australians&mdash;logged; the fact that some of the last remaining areas of wilderness in this country have gone; and the fact that there are endangered species, important flora and fauna, which this government is committed to protecting. These are responsibilities that any fair-minded political party has to consider as it deals with these issues. You have to give consideration to these conservation issues if you are fair dinkum. </PARA>

You do not give a damn about biodiversity values. You could not give a hoot that this particular nation has lost a significant number of species that previously were endangered. We have to take account of that. We have to take account of the fact that we are the only mega-diverse developed country in the world, and there is a commitment on the part of our community to protect and conserve the magnificent biodiversity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, more importantly, the challenge in this debate is to find a balance&mdash;between jobs, the future of local communities which are dependent on the forest industries, and the protection of important and high conservation value native forests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has spent the best part of 29 minutes speaking and, for perhaps 20 minutes of that speech, he was telling us how wonderful the process was that delivered this result. I must say that I am not convinced by what the minister said: that it was a good process, is a good process or should be accepted as being a suitable process to undertake here. This, I remind the Senate, is a process which was not even capable of guaranteeing the protection of what is proclaimed to be the oldest living organism on this planet&mdash;the Huon pine. One Huon pine that has hundreds of trunks and covers several hectares is to be found at Mount Reid in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process we have here, which the minister has just described to us as being useful, was so useless that that specimen&mdash;the oldest living organism on this planet&mdash;still does not have the protection which it should have. I believe that that alone brings us to a position where the process should be much more closely examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process really relies far too much on the input and cooperation of the states: states which can be&mdash;as in the case of Tasmania, in particular&mdash;intransigent, defiant and downright destructive. We have heard evidence in the past few days that the Premier of Tasmania is determined to hop in and log willy-nilly those areas that have been identified through the process. It seems that the process has delivered that result out of spite. You can't really describe that as being a wonderful process. That is a process which is supported by the opposition and which the minister has spent some time telling us is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that, in that process, Minister Faulkner was to advise Minister Beddall of certain things, including those areas which he thought deserved protection. That process then required Minister Beddall to consider that advice, and I stress the word `consider'. An extremely important part of that process was at this point&mdash;the point of Beddall's consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already been demonstrated in the Federal Court that Minister Beddall has been incapable of following what he was legally required to do. In his consideration of the minister for the environment's advice, we can see the fault of the process. That is why the Democrats believe that it is absolutely essential that we inquire into the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fault which is readily evident is that Minister Beddall has not given documentation of his justification for dismissing Minister Faulkner's advice that many, many hundreds of areas were recommended for protection. How was that advice dismissed? On what basis was that advice dismissed? It may well be that Minister Beddall found fault in some of the advice. It may well be that some of the advice was inadequate, poorly prepared or about the wrong things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had these assertions in this chamber time and time again over the past few days. But to be able to determine whether that is the case or not, we really need to be presented with Minister Beddall's reasons for making those decisions. Do reasons exist? Are there documents to substantiate those decisions made by Minister Beddall? Are those documents in existence on paper? Are they tangible, or were the decisions made in a rush? Or did they, in fact, just ignore the advice from the minister for the environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know and we cannot know unless we have a full inquiry into the process. We would then be able to determine whether Minister Beddall rejected the advice because he found fault with the areas described or any of the purported faults that have already been raised by the coalition ad nauseam in here. In fact, the Democrats, through our notices of motion, are seeking documentary evidence on the forests to be able to determine that for ourselves. We would prefer, of course, that we had the extensive powers of a Senate inquiry and we would prefer that we sought all documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was anything wrong with the advice of the minister for the environment, and if there was anything wrong with what had been collected and collated on his behalf, then Minister Beddall should have been able to detect that when he was considering it. Did Minister Beddall carry out a proper consideration&mdash;and I stress the word `proper'&mdash;of that advice? Did he consider that advice? Did he find fault with it? If so, what were the faults? What documentation exists to demonstrate those faults? After all, that is what the coalition has been chasing for the past fortnight. What was wrong with the advice? It was Minister Beddall's job to look for that. He had to consider that. Did he consider it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For him to stand here and ascribe the blame to the provider of the advice is, I think, sadly misdirected because the process itself was faulty. One of the players in that process is quite demonstrably incapable of following what he is legally required to do. He has been found guilty in a court of being incapable of following the legal advice. How on earth out of that shemozzle we can ascribe the responsibility to one minister, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Resources could at least respond to our request to document what it is that is wrong. All I am saying is that the environment minister's advice was part of the decision making process. When the Minister for Resources got it wrong, let us think about what happened then. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) entered the scene and threw in a hand grenade. He decided that a hand grenade was necessary and turned the circus that already existed into chaos. The trucks then entered the scene and another desperate solution was sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Democrats are anxious to do is inquire into the whole process so that we do not have a repetition of the circus, the hand grenade, the trucks and the decision which has left the industry unsure of where its future is, the conservation movement determined that the process should not be repeated, the coalition excited and the parliament disrupted. We do not want to see that happen again. It is not productive, it is a waste of time, it is a waste of effort and it certainly does not deliver us a nation which is honestly able to say that it has a process in place which guarantees the protection of those values which are worth protecting, a nation which guarantees the future of an industry which is valuable to the nation and which does not cause immense disruption to the law making and parliamentary scrutiny processes of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ian Macdonald's motion seeks to describe and censure the actions of the minister for the environment as gross incompetence and, in relation to the nomination of forest coupes, to ascribe to him responsibility for undermining the protection of high conservation areas and putting in jeopardy the jobs of forest workers. It is our contention that it is a far wider responsibility that must be addressed. We believe that the Prime Minister's hand grenade was just as responsible for all those problems described there and that it was Minister Beddall who stuffed it up to start with. It would be most irresponsible for us as a chamber to ascribe that responsibility to one minister in particular and to censure him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not support the motion. We believe, maintain and will insist that the proper way to address this is to have a full Senate inquiry and not seek half the documents or double the documents. After all, we have had some coalition members asking for half a set of documents, others asking for a full set of documents and others asking for documents which are not the ones that we really want. That is not the way to address the problem. The way to address the problem is to have a full inquiry into the whole process and, rather than seeking to blame somebody and take a scalp, to get about setting up a process which delivers proper outcomes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why you have press officers, no doubt. It is quite clear that there is a lack of confidence in Senator Faulkner's handling of this issue on his own side, let alone in the wider community. If you had any doubts about that, you could not possibly have any doubts after you listened to his own devastating self-indictment. Indeed, for the first 20 minutes or so we had a very low key, bumbling explanation and at the 10 minutes to go mark, he realised he had lost the plot and worked himself into a lather of indignation and, I think, tabled some documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is critically important about those documents is that they really only go to the question of whether certain moneys had been properly acquitted. In other words, did these conservation groups head for Rio and take the cash? They had nothing at all to do with the merits of whether those groups ought to have been commissioned in the first place. If Senator Faulkner thinks that that letter gets him off the hook, then he certainly needs a new secretary. The secretary himself would be highly embarrassed because he knows as well as we all do that, in fact, there was no need for Senator Faulkner to have commissioned those groups at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they have views they want to submit, submit them. If you have doubts about them, what do you do? You independently test them. You go off and ask a few experts. You invite the states to comment. You invite the Heritage Commission, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the Environment Protection Authority to comment. You invite your army of bureaucrats to comment. You do not hand over $120,000 to greenmail them so that they can effectively come up with a political fix that suits your ideological agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pretty obvious that by now what has happened is that the Peter principle has prevailed. Poor old Senator Faulkner thought when he came into this job that there was one big opportunity. With the demise of his political nemesis Graham Richardson, the man who cannot tell the truth from fiction, he saw a big opportunity to do another Richo, in other words, to get out there and repeat that shameless exercise that Senator Collins is also acutely embarrassed about, where Senator Richardson, as he then was, was prepared to persuade Old Jellyback and others that Kakadu stage three had such glowing environmental characteristics that it had to be protected at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So while we were really talking about Senator Evans's clapped-out buffalo country, all we ever got on the television vision were photographs of Jim Jim Falls and Obiri Rock and all these other wonderful places in Kakadu, stage one, which of course are highly worthy of preservation. That was a very shabby and shoddy exercise, but one that we have come to expect from someone who played the game the way Senator Richardson did&mdash;in an utterly amoral, cynical and highly political fashion. But the apprentice was no match. He very quickly found himself out of his depth. So he tried to curry favour with groups that he thought would come up with the answers he wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner said today that he found it outrageous and offensive that on this side we should be somehow impugning the integrity of these fine people who were dedicated to the preservation of the environment, who were only trying to help. Their formal assessments have become, as I understand it, simply `advice as part of a range of inputs' in the last few days. But if you read the documents they presented, these were assessments. Until a few days ago it was all pretty serious stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what Senator Faulkner's own view is of those people. According to Don Greenleas, he told a meeting of caucus yesterday that he was working on `a new protocol'&mdash;so clearly that is his word&mdash;`for consultations between the government and green groups which would almost certainly lead to more selective contacts'. Senator Faulkner, who only last year declared that he was prepared to be a very strong advocate for green groups, has privately admitted that it is no longer feasible to maintain a degree of close contact and information sharing with conservationists who run an anti-Labor agenda. It is a bit like Bolkus going up to the gallery at one time and saying to one of the chiefs-of-staff: `What do you mean by running an item critical of me? Are you on the team or aren't you?' Very typical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand Senator Faulkner's great embarrassment because the thing has blown up in his face. He thought he had the fix in place. There was no need to have commissioned those groups, but even when he did, they provided on his own evidence something like 800 coupes worthy of preservation&mdash;in other words, with high conservation value. To that he added another 500 off his own bat. We do not know why or how, but he did. Then Mr Beddall whittled that list down to a mere 85. So clearly the 1,300 was just an ambit claim in the first place. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whose fault is it? It is not the fault of the conservation groups that Senator Faulkner came up with a list of 1,300 in the first instance. We know whose fault it is. It is a new creature that had not been on the scene until a few days ago&mdash;it is the portfolio. Remember when Senator Evans got up and complained about the language being mangled? You would not believe the way the language has been mangled in recent days. I had not heard of `ground truthing', I have to confess, until yesterday. I would prefer a bit of honest truthing, but there it is. We are now all `ground truthers', apparently. </PARA>

Senator Faulkner has not the slightest idea what the term means, but he somehow thinks in his own simple way that if he uses the jargon then the groups will think, `Boy, this fellow knows what he is talking about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About all I have seen to date out of this process is rigor mortis. It was dead on arrival. There was nothing scientific about the process. The process involved not getting independent assessments but simply getting the people who already had a strong commitment to what you wanted to put it forward and then building on it, in effect. What we know is that for someone who is green in the job, who has just arrived, it is an absolute lay down misere for people of the calibre of Phillip Toyne not just to run the agenda but to run the minister. That is what they have done. Poor old Senator Faulkner is reduced to saying things like, `It was the portfolio what done it.' The portfolio is his creature. If he wants to tell them how to do it, he does. You cannot stand up and say, `Don't take any notice of the $120,000 worth of advice that I got because it is obviously shonky. As we know, it included coupes that do not exist, it included coupes that have been logged to death and it included things that clearly have no high conservation value. Don't worry about that advice because I have a whole heap of other advice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the end result? You might have got advice from all around the countryside. If it turns out to be utterly flawed, you are responsible. So it is no good saying, `Don't blame them, blame me.' And we are. That is what this motion is about today. The buck has to stop there. You cannot simply say, `Beddall is not too flash and therefore we will ignore Faulkner's role in it.' You have to put the blame where it lies. The trouble is, as Laurie Oakes and others have pointed out, that if you have two ministers who are asked by a part-time Prime Minister to put their heads together but the fact is they do not talk to one another, it does make it rather difficult. But it is not good enough for Senator Faulkner to say, `I invited the states to have an input and they refused' when you talk about people like the New South Wales state forests. They gave Mr Beddall chapter and verse. They gave him pages and pages of lists. They actually did the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the way these conservation groups like the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales managed to come up with lists was because they went around to the state forest offices and asked them: `What is being logged, or what is due to be logged in 1995?' They got all these bits and pieces, put them together and that became their list. That is pretty amateurish stuff, but we cannot in any shape or form blame the New South Wales state forests for not cooperating when they did all they were asked to do. They knew that Beddall was running the process. They provided the information to him and then Senator Faulkner writes and says, `Give it to me.' They say: `Why do we give it to you? We have already given it to Beddall. You talk to him.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner seems to have a communications problem&mdash;not just with Richo over a period of years but with another New South Wales colleague whom he has been told to work closely with by someone who obviously could not be bothered himself getting involved until it was far too late in the day. He even had to bring in the likes of Senator Collins. He had to sack both of them and ask someone who could not shut up for a second to go out there and try to talk the boys into it. We can understand the desperation of that move but it does not disguise the fact that poor old Senator Faulkner was out of his depth. </PARA>

Do not get caught up with the language. You and I know that it is about making sure that ordinary Australian families pay a bit more for fuel. It has nothing to do with putting a tax on carbon. It has a lot to do with raising revenue to get you out of a very big current account and budget deficit hole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell the opposition, because I have had a number of discussions with representatives of that industry over the last few weeks, that for the first time that industry is extremely interested to hear what the coalition's position on this is. It wants to hear even a basic position, not a detailed one. It is still waiting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two matters must be determined during this debate. The first is a policy position that will provide essential protection for those areas of high conservation value in Australia that need to be protected. I made one additional note&mdash;I left it off&mdash;about the nonsense that Senator Ian Macdonald issued. He said, `Collins wants the 509 coupes logged.' I can tell the Senate emphatically that I want nothing of the sort, have never wanted it and never will want it. That is the kind of one-eyed approach that the coalition  takes on all of these important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that Senator Ian Macdonald wants all 509 coupes logged. But I am afraid that the timber industry, which has a legitimate desire to have some indication of what both the government and the alternative government propose for the industry, is still waiting for the coalition. I have mentioned what the environmentalists and people concerned with forests want. They want the certainty that these areas that deserve to be protected will be protected. The timber industry wants a policy position which will provide an underpinning for growth and certainty in that industry as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline the federal coalition industry policy in respect of forests. I will read the last and most important paragraph. This policy, which was published in 1993, has not yet been changed. I have checked that it has not even been amended by any public statements that have been made in the last two weeks when endless opportunities have been available to make them. It says that the coalition will place no time limits on the export of woodchips from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz now has a classic opportunity to say that it has changed. I will be delighted to hear him clarify it. I will read it again. The coalition's policy, as printed and unamended, is that the coalition will place no time limits on the export of woodchips from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gibson is a thoughtful man. He may be able to contribute to this matter because of his interest in the law. The policy says, `Regional strategies which are drawn up and implemented according to Commonwealth approved procedures by providing legislative backing.' That is what should happen to forests. So the opposition says that the states should continue to run them under regional forest agreements according to Commonwealth approved procedures. But in this policy the opposition then takes away the one single lever the Commonwealth has, which is export controls over woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made a very significant contribution to this debate in announcing a percentage scale-down of these woodchips. Why is that important? I will tell the Senate why. Because for the first time in this debate it has focused the attention on every player in the debate to finally get these regional agreements developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, a lot of time was wasted. As I have said, the Commonwealth has to take our share of the blame for that&mdash;it is on the public record&mdash;but it has been a joint problem. We have to deal with six state governments and a territory government plus, properly, a whole range of other affected agencies. In terms of developing these all-important guidelines, they go backwards and forwards at bureaucratic level for a year. Before we know it, a year has gone. The Prime Minister fixed that in his statement. He has announced&mdash;this is important&mdash;that there will be a scale-down of these woodchips, which the opposition's policy says there will be no time limit placed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You in the opposition should take the opportunity this afternoon&mdash;Senator Alston and Senator Ian Macdonald have not&mdash;to tell us whether you still have a policy that there will be no time limit placed on how long woodchips are exported from this country. I will tell you this as a matter of fact: if you place no time limit, you will never get these regional agreements signed. The only reason we now have, for the first time, state governments, the timber industry and a lot of environmentalists saying let us do it is because of that scale-down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you why. The timber industry was dragging its heels on these regional agreements. Why? Because it feared that putting them into place would mean that trees would be protected. The environmentalists were dragging their heels on these agreements because, by finally signing off on them, it would be a concession that some trees would be cut down. The state governments were dragging their heels on it because they did not want to cede any degree of power to the Commonwealth for what is their constitutional responsibility, and that is to manage the forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has changed all that? I will tell you. The Prime Minister has changed all that. It is a fact. Now they know that there will be a percentage scale-down, starting now, of chips. Everyone is now absolutely focused on the need to get these regional agreements signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Senator Alston said two things that made sense. He asked whose fault it was and said the process is at issue here. He is dead right on both counts. This is not a problem of the decision making of either the minister for the environment or the Minister for Resources. The problem here is the process. We all know it; we have known it for years. We initiate it, despite the fact that we have only export controls over woodchips. We are given the responsibility of controlling this particular dog, but we have it by only the tip of the tail. That is all we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To our credit, we took the initiative to construct a national forest policy agreement that will provide managed forests in Australia for all time, for everyone's sake. But we wanted to do it by agreement. In my view, that agreement is now going to be forthcoming for the first time. The reason is that the Prime Minister has now put a real deadline on the process. So now, in all of the discussions I have had with the state ministers, with the industry, with the environmental groups, everyone has agreed that this will become the major focus. </PARA>

<PARA>The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, who has tried to fill the shoes of the environment's hero, Senator Graham Richardson, has found his feet have turned to clay. It takes more than a yes man who is at the beck and call of the environment movement, who feeds the greenies with so-called consultancy fees, who panders to the environmentalists' every wish, to become a hero. In the eyes of fair-minded Australians who want sustainable development, real jobs preserved and our environment protected by legitimate environmental management, the minister has dismally failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There could be no greater example of a soft and unaccountable government than Senator Faulkner's management of the ongoing debacle in his so-called assessment process. Senator Faulkner is not fit to be a minister for the environment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner is now the fallen hero of even the extreme forest ferals. His charade has been exposed. Up until now Green groups have had the ears and eyes of the public, with their emotive and hysterical protests sitting on tripods, being seen carried kicking and screaming into the back of paddy wagons. These emotive scenes have been captured on our televisions and radio sets for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was until last week. This was the week when the timber industry was able to go toe to toe with the environment movement. It gave the public a demonstration that made us all sit up and think. The difference was that the timber industry had the facts to substantiate its case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media at first trod warily. Then, when they could see that what the timber industry had been saying in an unemotive way for years made sense, this was a turning point for the timber industry. It was able to demonstrate that Senator Faulkner's assessments were carried out sloppily and in a way that completely made a rort of the assessment procedure. Senator Faulkner was shown to be incompetent and biased, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has now woken up to the fact that the environmentalists have been filling him and his government with indefensible propaganda and making fools of them. He has now deserted you, Senator Faulkner&mdash;realising too late that the government's decisions were based on lies and distortions. Like a little boy who cannot be trusted, the Prime Minister pulled the minister off the job and brought in Senator Collins&mdash;the big job clean-up man&mdash;to broker a deal to limit the political morass into which the whole team had been thrown. In a letter to the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) dated 7 December 1994 submitting the first instalment of his now infamous forest preservation list, Senator Faulkner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in preparing my advice I have been rigorous in identifying forests of high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>Later, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 3 February, the minister again claimed that he had undertaken the most rigorous assessment practicable on the basis of the information available. These statements are the low water mark of Senator Faulkner's competency and accountability. These statements make his holding of this important portfolio untenable. These statements have now been proved to be untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister subsequently reduced this rigorously determined list from 1,300 coupes to 509&mdash;or should it be 511? No-one knows. That is how incompetent the procedure was. At the Prime Minister's press conference he said, `Let's call a spade a spade. If 200 or 230 coupes had been reserved before Christmas, the environment movement would have thought they'd kicked a tremendous goal.' The goalposts have been continually moved in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister that his assessments and lists were based on little scientific evidence. They were purely political decisions, and they have satisfied no-one. Senator Faulkner has had many opportunities over the last two weeks to explain the transparent lack of rigour in his lists, and he has failed to do so. He set up the process and he has demeaned the process. Senator Faulkner has done irreparable harm to the legitimate concerns of the conservation movement. I think that is worth repeating: he has done irreparable harm to the legitimate concerns of the conservation movement. He has done irreparable harm to the timber industry, and he has done irreparable harm to the nation's economy during a period when our current account deficit is running at an all-time high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pathetically, the minister has attempted to continue to defend a list that is shonky and indefensible. The caucus is publicly giving the same message. Mr Barry Cunningham, the member for McMillan, said, `We are moving away from good government.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence of this disillusionment is simple: in Victoria at least 10 of the coupes are non-existent. I have heard about the ghost gums, but now we have the ghost coupes.

We have to look at what this debate is really about. Senator Ian MacDonald gets up in here and moves a censure motion against Senator Faulkner. The shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure has not made too many issues about regional development since he has been in here, and he is not in here now. He has not raised any issues about regional development in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the opposition jumped up and down and ranted and raved about the national forest policy statement&mdash;something we brought about&mdash;and kept telling us that it is such a great thing. Senator Crane came in here today with one page. I saw Senator Panizza with another page the other day; yet I have not seen any of the others with any pages. Senator Crane, for all intents and purposes, wanted to use that one page&mdash;that is probably about all he has read&mdash;to support his contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the opposition chose to make the issue about export woodchip licences. It came in here and said, `Terrible,  terrible, terrible. All these jobs are going to go because of the fact that these export woodchip licences are not secure.' Let me tell you that the one very important thing in this debate that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said is that there ought to be a reduction in export woodchips. There is no doubt about that because there are no social and economic benefits for us to continue to export woodchips out of this country, particularly when we have a trade deficit in forest products and commodities which makes up 13 per cent of our trade deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have a policy of continuing export woodchips indefinitely. That is what they want to do. They want to continue to export the forests out of this country in woodchips and not make one ounce of contribution to the wellbeing of the workers they hypocritically in the extreme pretend to represent. You have no hope of representing workers of this country and, more importantly, representing workers in this industry. For the benefit of those opposite, I will read from the national forest policy statement. The foreword states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Statement has been jointly developed by the Commonwealth, States and Territories through the Australian Forestry Council and the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council in consultation with other relevant government agencies, the Australian Local Government Association, unions, industry representatives, conservation organisations and the general community.</PARA>
<PARA>It sets out a process through which we will get the very important protection for some of our natural heritage, much of which has been taken away in the very short time we have been in this country. We will also deliver through it a forest industry&mdash;one which I stand up for very much, but which needs some changes. The industry does not need a policy that says, `Export woodchips forever.' This policy will bring about some stability to an industry that can deliver to this country and to the people who work in the industry more security in terms of jobs, more security in terms of development and long-term security in terms of the supply of resource, because we will have forests that will be managed on a sustainable basis forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to again raise the hypocrisy in the continuation of this opposition's pursuit of this issue. We have had a forest industry since the year dot. We have had export woodchips since the 1970s. We have had a national forest policy statement since 1990; yet not once before last week  did the opposition come in here and attempt to secure any input into the process. Not even at the last election did it have a policy that would make any contribution at all to the long-term future stability of the industry or, indeed, of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know who represents you lot over there on forests, but you have really sent in the heavyweights today. You got your shadow spokesman for regional development to bowl the balls, or we thought he was going to bowl some balls. I can remember an incident where one of the Chappell brothers bowled a ball underarm once. I have to say that Senator Ian Macdonald's underarm ball did not even make the other end of the pitch. Senator Alston, the communications spokesman, was also sent in to bat. He still has a view that this is a woodchip policy. He is confusing that with the opposition's policy, because it has a woodchip policy. We have a policy about delivering a sustainable industry that actually returns some benefit to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to hear that the Democrats are not supporting this ridiculous censure motion which is of no relevance whatsoever. Those opposite believe that this motion is delivering some political benefit to them, but that is the most stupid thing they could ever think of because it clearly demonstrates the fact that they really have not come out of the coma they were in before Christmas and prior to their choosing a third leader in 12 months. They still have not come out of that to make any reasonable contribution to the political debate of this country&mdash;they just simply cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise a couple of points with regard to the position of the Democrats. Whilst I agree in part with Senator Bell that there is, and has been, a problem with the process, it cannot be levelled at any particular person or area. There is a range of people who are involved in the national forest policy statement and bringing it together needs the participation of the states. Senator Bell said he found fault with the process. He did not say that he found fault with the process when he thought the 1,300 coupes were relevant and/or to be protected. He did not find fault with the process when he said he was going to go out and raise money to mount legal challenges to the current export woodchip licences. Indeed, I do not know whether he has found much fault with the process when he says he is proposing to introduce a bill to ban woodchipping altogether. So I do question the validity and the credibility of some of the things that Senator Bell has said. Senator Abetz has been contributing to this debate. </PARA>

The 50 coupes that the Tasmanian shadow minister was talking about are coupes that were on the register of the national estate. They are totally separate from the 509. So, Senator Macdonald, if you are going to come in here and make claims about members of parliament in other places, claims about what they said, and try to interpret what they said, I suggest that you get your facts straight.

That is abhorrent, it is ridiculous and it should be brought to an end. We should make the participants in this industry either get in and do something about it or we should give that resource to somebody who will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a motion by Senator Ian Macdonald&mdash;probably the most extreme right wing representative and anti-environment representative of the opposition&mdash;to censure the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner). There are two reasons why one should consider censuring a minister. One of those reasons involves technical competence and the other one is to deal with the way in which the issues, namely the portfolio responsibilities, are handled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the first one, the technical competence of the minister, the situation is quite clear because the matter has in fact been tested in the courts. Mr Justice Sackville found that the incompetence lay with the Mr Beddall in the administration of his portfolio. I will return to that in a moment. There was no fault found in that hearing against the minister for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantial issue here is the administration of his portfolio responsibilities&mdash;he is the minister for the environment looking after the environment. One can well understand Senator Macdonald having a disagreement there because Senator Macdonald would totally disagree with any ministry at all which was designed to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One need only look back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record to see the way in which, at every opportunity, any suggestion that the environment be protected has been resisted and opposed by Senator Macdonald. In recent days there have been debates on greenhouse emissions and the suggestion that we might do something about it by putting a resource tax on carbon based fuels. There was opposition to that. Senators will recall the attempt to do something in the transport area, to find a substantial source of an alternative transport fuel for Australia&mdash;the use of ethanol. Senators will recall Senator Macdonald's opposition to that bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look back at the reasons for this particular debate this afternoon and you look at what has happened over the last couple of weeks, you will find that my colleague Senator Bell, who spoke earlier this afternoon, attempted to get an inquiry into the very matters about which the opposition has been seeking a great deal of information. It would have been a proper inquiry which could have looked at the whole process, looked at all the facts, and out of that we could have formed an opinion as to whether the process was faulty, as to whether Minister Faulkner or Minister Beddall or both were at fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we heard from the opposition was: `We don't want an inquiry; we have the government on the run. This is a political matter. We are going to pursue this matter through political means.' That is the reason the opposition did not want a proper inquiry. Having the government on the run, as those opposite think, they are pursuing this matter in the absence of a great deal of information which they themselves have asked for, information which is not yet available. Surely they should have waited until that information was available before proceeding with a censure motion such as this. This is a political move and should be seen simply as a political move, not as an issue to bring out facts in relation to the substantive issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, Senator Macdonald, the substantive issue is the proper protection of the forests and the establishment of a sustainable industry, not simply scoring political points by trying to move censure motions against the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. That is your concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been numerous motions in recent days asking for information which would allow the Senate to properly consider all the facts in relation to the process which we have seen here. Many of those motions have been put by the opposition. The opposition has often asked for information to be supplied within a very short time frame. We have supported many of those motions. We ourselves have three notices of motion which we will be seeking to move as formal tomorrow. We give the government until 1 March to provide that information. In the light of that information, we will then make up our mind. It is clearly a political move not aimed at improving the substantive matter here, the proper management of forests, but simply to get at the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, looking at the evidence that has been properly tested in the courts and upon which Mr Justice Sackville has given judgment, it is Mr Beddall who has failed in the proper following of the procedures which are set down. Whether those procedures are faulty or not is Mr Justice Sackville's opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has repeated this afternoon and on a number of other occasions that if an area of forest has in some way been damaged then it is automatically ruled out from having value which would cause it to be protected. That is absolutely a non sequitur. It would mean that one could go into any area of forest and once that area is minimally damaged it would deserve no protection and progressively you would wipe out all forests in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Bell gave an example the other day of an area of forest in the south-east of New South Wales, which I visited several years ago, in which 22,000 koalas were shot in the 1920s before there was koala protection. There are no koalas in that area now and the New South Wales Forestry Commission has said, `That is not koala habitat; therefore, it can be logged.' If one accepts that sort of logic, one would say that that area will continue to be logged. It will never again become koala habitat, yet clearly it has the potential to be an excellent koala habitat. Therefore, that area could play a very valuable role in the protection of threatened species. Here is an area which has been damaged, yet clearly it has value sufficient to warrant its protection from further logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could look at many other areas. Senator Bell has given an example this afternoon of possibly the oldest living thing, plant or animal in the world&mdash;a Huon pine in Tasmania which is estimated to be at least 10,500 years old. If that area had been in some way damaged, by the opposition's logic it should not be on the list; therefore, it could be logged, and that tree could be cut down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the logic of those opposite. Basically, they are not interested in the substantive issue, which is, on the one hand, the protection of important areas of forest in Australia to preserve those values&mdash;forestry protection, wildlife and threatened species protection, recreation value protection, protection of waterways and supply of water and the aesthetic values which forests contain&mdash;and, on the other hand, building a sustainable forestry industry in Australia, which we do not have that at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forest industry in Australia has soaked up more than $5 billion worth of debt, public moneys which have been put into the forest industry. Surely that is something the opposition would object to. Those opposite object to public subsidy in every other respect, yet here they are trying to protect an industry which has soaked up such an enormous amount of public subsidy. Surely that should be rooted out. We have an industry which is still totally out of balance with respect to the balance of trade. Surely, again, we need very substantial expansion of plantation forestry in Australia so that we do become self-sufficient in forest products, so that we do supply all those things, so that there are secured jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the 509 coupes or the 1,300 coupes are concerned, it is an absolute lie that the removal of those coupes would have made any difference whatsoever to any employment this year. The 509 coupes, as I asked the minister the other day, involve one-fifteenth of one per cent of Australia's forested area, half a per cent of the forest available for logging, and roughly five per cent of the area which was in fact marked out for logging in 1995. The removal of five per cent of that area could easily have been substituted for another five per cent, other coupes which were available for logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that there was suddenly going to precipitate a decline in employment in the forestry industry simply is not true. There has been a decline in employment in the forestry industry&mdash;from 55,000 in 1971-72 to 32,000 in 1991-92&mdash;but against that, the production from Australian forests has gone up from 11 million cubic metres to 16 million cubic metres. The reduction in employment has not been accompanied by a reduction in production. In fact, it has been accompanied by a substantial increase in production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efforts of conservationists to protect old-growth and important forests have not been accompanied by a decline in the availability of timber. The loss of jobs has been due, quite simply, to the increased capitalisation of the industry and the shift from sawlogs to woodchips. The claims being made in relation to workers, unions and so on are really without foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other points. Several speakers from the opposition have mentioned greenhouse this afternoon in quite a spurious way. I think Senator Alston brought the issue of greenhouse into the debate. Senator Boswell earlier this afternoon asked a question about greenhouse. Senator Boswell, in his question, made it quite clear that he did not even understand the basic elements of the carbon cycle. Relating this to forests, he argued that there should be a tax rebate to those who grow trees and those who plant sugar cane. If you take the logic of the latter&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues, particularly Senator Ian Macdonald for his censure motion against the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. We have seen here in Canberra for the last two weeks an absolute mess over this issue of Australia's native forests. The real culprit for bringing on this mess and getting the government into trouble is Senator Faulkner. He has shown complete incompetence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not long ago, only last year, that Senator Faulkner became Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. One would have thought that one of the first things he should have done when he became minister was engage competent staff to look after him because it is obvious he knows nothing about environmental issues. One would have thought he would have engaged good staff to help him so that he could get proper advice. He also ought to have been aware that his department had been politicised for years, started off by Senator Richardson and carried on by Ros Kelly. It got to the stage where absolutely no-one, not even the conservation movement, would trust what came out of that department. Senator Faulkner has really taken this matter of trees to heart and thought he could do a Richo, as Senator Alston pointed out before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Faulkner issued his environment policy statement in the middle of last year, he basically sketched a scene of his doing many things. But what has happened? The only thing he has concentrated on is trees, the forests. He has been playing with the forests and pandering to the extreme greens. In recent times we have seen these chickens coming home to roost. He has actually handed out $120,000 to the green groups to help him politicise decision making by the government on an annual basis, which is again a sham and a nonsense, for the export woodchip industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us step back and see what this argument has really all been about. The woodchip licence debate has been a politicised debate organised by the government to play green politics in suburban Melbourne and Sydney against the interests of conservation and the forest industry. The real argument for many years concerning the native forests has been how much park there should be, how much reserve there should be and how much forest should be used for multiple use in Australia. The argument has been going on for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several years ago, in the late 1980s, then Prime Minister Hawke engaged the Resource Assessment Commission to do a study to settle once and for all these arguments advanced by the greens, the industry and the various state departments, who, after all, have responsibility for running these lands, as to what the truth of the matter was. What came out of that was a report which indicated that there was no reason why the native forests could not be managed, as they were being managed, on a sustained basis to produce multiple products&mdash;wood, water, recreation and conservation values&mdash;provided also that there were proper reserve areas, preserved and left intact; in other words, our parks and proper conservation areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real argument is: how much park and conservation area; and, how much multiple-use forest? That is what it is really all about. The woodchips are really just a diversion, a political diversion. It has been a diversion that has been used deliberately by the federal government each year in this annual export licence process to try to play politics for suburban Melbourne and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Resource Assessment Commission report and after lots of argument each year with the states, again, what happened was that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at long last was forced into signing a national forest policy statement in December 1993, just over two years ago. That was a statement signed by the Prime Minister and most of the states; in fact, there has been general agreement by all the states on that forest policy statement. That statement is about how to finally decide at the margin, only for a small proportion, what of the remaining native forests should go into park&mdash;what small proportion should go into park, and what should be left alone for multiple use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In south-east Australia&mdash;that is the southern states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania&mdash;about half of the native forests are already locked up in parks and reserves of one sort or another. So the argument is what to do with the other half. How much of it, perhaps a few per cent, should be added after proper scientific study into the parks and reserves? But no, what have we got? We have got the extreme green movement pushing to have the whole lot, 100 per cent of all the forests, locked up forever and to have ordinary Australians paying higher prices via imports for forest products&mdash;forest products coming from forests in other countries that are not as well managed as they are in Australia. There are no forests anywhere in the world as well managed as the native forests are here in Australia. So we had this silly argument about woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years ago the Prime Minister and most of the premiers signed this agreement to settle this argument once and for all and to go ahead with the studies to find out what small proportion of the remaining half of the forest of this part of Australia should go into parks. There was agreement that that should be done on a cooperative basis. It required good faith, cooperation and trust by all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened over the past two years? The environment department of the Commonwealth government continued its long period of attempts to stop settlement of this longstanding dispute and kept working against the interests in the settlement of this dispute. If you go and talk to each of the state governments and the state government departments responsible for this matter, they will complain bitterly to you, and have done so out on the public record, about the lack of cooperation from this department and the ministers: starting off with Senator Richardson originally, then Ros Kelly and now the current minister, Senator Faulkner. Unfortunately, poor Senator Faulkner walked into all this not understanding it all. I assume that he has not had the staff to basically guide him through all this mess. Regardless of that, he is responsible; so we have this terrible mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the department is not trusted by anyone in the responsible land management agencies throughout Australia. Minister Collins mentioned CALM before; that is, the Western Australian department's process. Each of the states has gone through a very similar process. Senator Ian Macdonald has copies of the documents from the south-east of New South Wales, from the Eden area. The same thing has happened in my state in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been long and detailed processes of looking at what parts of the native forests should go into park and what should go into multiple use. Virtually all of the work has been done; what we are arguing about is just the little bit at the margin. That is what the Prime Minister put in his statement. It was about wanting to ban woodchips on the bit at the margin, not on the total situation. But Senator Faulkner has encouraged his department to go ahead on this basis of looking at the woodchip licence situation at the end of last year, and what did he do? He went and encouraged the green groups to produce this mad list of 1,300 coupes and do it with a payment of $120,000. It has been shown in this chamber and in the other place over the last fortnight that that whole process was an absolute shonk, that there were dozens of coupes that were absolute nonsense. They were not of high conservation value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important matter arising from that national forest policy statement&mdash;which, again, I remind you was signed by the Prime Minister and the premiers&mdash;was the moratorium clause. Senator Faulkner and, I assume, his department have misinterpreted that moratorium clause. The moratorium clause is all to do with the final assessment of wilderness and old growth as to what parts of old growth and wilderness should be added to the park system. It was not to do with other issues. That was the thing that had to be settled. That is what the premiers and the Prime Minister signed off on. Senator Faulkner, I believe, has deliberately misinterpreted that clause in the forest policy statement and he has deliberately encouraged the green groups to run off and chase other things; hence we have this terrible mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is basically what has happened. It has been incompetence by the minister which has led to this mess. Why is it that the Prime Minister had to intervene last week? Why is it that Senator Collins is now running the show? Because there has been incompetence by two ministers: Minister Beddall and Senator Faulkner. But the prime culprit is Senator Faulkner. He engineered it. He deliberately went out and encouraged the extreme greens to come up with this wish list instead of going the professional route and going to the land managers in the states that had the detailed information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do some of the land managers not trust his department? Because his department over the last several years has sold them down the drain, has not cooperated with them and will not provide the criteria for doing these assessments. Why? Because the department is basically run by extreme greens acting on an extreme green agenda. They do not want this issue settled once and for all. They want the crisis to continue year in, year out, hoping they will get more forest locked up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have heard Senator Collins say this afternoon that the government is committed to getting this fixed up once and for all. The opposition policy is to have the matter fixed up once and for all. That is our firm policy. Senator Collins cannot say he does not know and the industry does not know what our policy is. Last Monday I was with the two shadow ministers and our leader who went and addressed the group here at Parliament House and pointed out that we were in favour of the national forest policy. We are in favour of those regional agreements being settled once and for all and quickly so that we can get on and have multiple-use forests and also conservation areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner, by carrying on in the way he has in pushing this extreme green process, has demeaned the whole process of looking at conservation areas. He has demeaned that process and has really sold out all Australians, including all of us who are concerned about true conservation areas. All of us, certainly in the coalition, want a basis of proper reserves of the forests throughout Australia. That is what needs to be fixed and fixed once and for all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these documents is a list of people with relevant professional qualifications involved in the production of the high conservation value reports undertaken for the federal Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories by Environment Victoria, Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, Tasmanian Conservation Trust and the Conservation Council of Western Australia. The list does not include individuals involved in administrative and other support tasks whose names appear in the acknowledgment section of the reports, nor does it include the name of one professional who has specifically requested for privacy reasons that his name be withheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has stated previously, he is strongly of the view that it is the conservation organisations that are totally accountable for the contents of the reports. His department contracted the four conservation organisations to provide the high conservation value reports, and they are the ones who will be required to provide the acquittal reports as set out in the contracts he tabled in the Senate last week. The persons who carried out the work for the conservation organisations would have had varying responsibilities in those assessments, and the ultimate accountability for the reports must lie with the organisation as a whole. </PARA>

Also included are copies of the contracts, together with covering letters from the department and letters of acceptance from the conservation groups. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Senator Faulkner has carried out his responsibilities as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories; I believe that he has done it very well. I am disappointed though in Senator Ian Macdonald. I am reminded of a notice of motion which Senator Ian Macdonald moved recently which related to damage which was being done to the Barrier Reef by Asian fishermen in their use of cyanide to remove valuable fish. In clause 4 of that notice of motion, he said that the effect of the chemical sprays on the reef is equivalent to `a holocaust'. I agree with him, and I agree with the contents of his motion which was calling on the government to do something about that particular illegal activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ian Macdonald, nevertheless, does not recognise that certain logging methods and behaviour of certain loggers in coupes in Australian forests have also had the effect of a holocaust on those forests. While some people log in a way that is certainly environmentally less damaging than others, some are very careless with the future of the environment. I believe&mdash;and I have heard people from both sides of the parliament say that they also believe&mdash;in the protection of the environment, and that is it is vital to the Australian community, and in particular to its young people to whom the future belongs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Faulkner, as the minister, certainly operates on that basis. It is his responsibility to look after the environment; that is what he has been put there for. I believe that he brings to the office the particular determination of making use of people who are qualified, as accords with the list that Senator Crowley has just tabled in the parliament, and that he has come down with a view about the coupes that should be protected, based on reality and expertise. The groups that are involved in real confrontation over the use of forests are the conservationists and the people who log forests. </PARA>

There are those people in the logging area who traditionally have, over the years, planted trees for plantations which will be harvested at a later date. I know there are paper manufacturers in Tasmania, for instance, who have been planting trees probably for the last 70 years; I respect that. I think they have found the correct way to go and are continuing on that path.

Some time ago, he was in a meeting&mdash;I think it was in Brisbane&mdash;where he offered those people millions of dollars to assist them to deny foreign countries the opportunity to go into their forests and log forest areas which were fairly sensitive.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that this issue be resolved as soon as possible, and conflict either eliminated or greatly reduced.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia needs to conserve its native forests consistent with its objectives for biological diversity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Crowley. In dealing with these first, I want to correct the misrepresentation by Senator Collins. He did somewhat disappoint me today, because if there was one minister on the government side who may have come out of this with a little bit of integrity&mdash;and I emphasise `may'&mdash;he destroyed it very quickly today. He came in here and reported from a document&mdash;which I requested him to table so that we knew exactly what he was quoting from: it was our resource security statement before going into the last election&mdash;and he paraded it as our environmental policy. When you misrepresent a situation such as that, you are getting down into the Senator Faulkner class.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to senators on the other side of the house that, if they are going to quote from a document of ours, they should at least get right what it is about. For that reason&mdash;and, unfortunately, in this debate I have not got time to go into this&mdash;I have tabled what our environmental policy was at the last election. I want to emphasise one point about our position: it was about full support of the national forest policy statement and working towards regional agreements with the states. On the surface, it is not very different from the government's position, except for one person involved with the government&mdash;and, of course, my disappointment in Senator Collins today&mdash;and that is Senator Faulkner. I have to say that Senator Faulkner must become known as the person who speaketh with a forked tongue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will demonstrate that through the questions and matters that I have raised here over the last fortnight. I begin with the position in Western Australia and the AHC-CALM agreement. I emphasise, as I have done before, that this was supported by everybody at the time&mdash;including the Democrats and Senator Coulter&mdash;in terms of politics. I was most surprised to hear some of his comments today. They will also have to be dealt with at another time, because we are dealing with a censure motion of Senator Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out to the government why Senator Faulkner should be censured. On 12 December in a letter to the Western Australian Minister for the Environment, Mr Kevin Minson, Senator Faulkner said that they would give full faith and credit to the AHC-CALM agreement with regard to the various coupes and the applications that were made from Western Australia&mdash;`full faith and credit'. The letter is here for anybody who wants to read it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, we have quite a litany of letters from Senator Faulkner to the Hon. David Beddall&mdash;what I call the `Dear David' letters. The one which I will quote from is dated 14 December 1994 and goes into a number of aspects with regard to export licences and others. There is a very interesting addendum to it; that is, attachment 3. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Actions to be progressed by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and relevant state agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Western Australia. Actions to determine the ecological sustainability of current and proposed methods and levels of native forest harvesting should be initiated. This should include a comprehensive regional assessment of the central and Swan forest regions. The AHC/CALM region assessment should be progressed to a regional forest agreement as outlined in the national forest policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is so important because it does not mention the southern region. The southern region is where the assessment was done, and it is where more than 50 of the coupes, I think it is 54, were identified by the dart-throwing exercise in which some $120,000&mdash;I think the figure was about $40,000 in Western Australia&mdash;was given away to the conservation council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The region is not even mentioned in that statement. That was 14 December, two days after that letter. In Senator Faulkner's answer to my question the other day he suddenly changed his mind. He said it was not adequate. Let us look at something else which Senator Faulkner said which once again proves he speaketh with forked tongue. In a letter on 19 December, which was just a few days down the track&mdash;and take note that it is once again addressed to `Dear David'&mdash;Senator Faulkner is writing to the Hon.

Already he is changing his mind and adopting a different position in terms from that given to the Western Australian minister and put in appendix 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could not be any more deceptive than that. If Senator Faulkner wanted to change the government's position on the national forest policy statement, which he said today the government supported&mdash;I will come back to that in a moment&mdash;why was he writing letters such as this at that time to the Hon. David Beddall. Why is the southern region not included in appendix 3 if his position has changed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a total misleading, first of all, of the Western Australian environment minister, of this parliament and of the people of Australia as to his real position. I suspect that he misled some of the people on the other side.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point relates to the actions of this minister who not only speaketh with forked tongue but also behaves in the same manner. I put the issue of his behaviour very seriously to Senator Bell from the Democrats. This will be a real test of whether or not the Democrats support this sort of behaviour from a minister carrying out his responsibilities. Senator Faulkner has just entered the chamber and I recognise that he has come back to listen to a little bit of the debate after walking out after his contribution. I put it to him here and now: why did you say to me that the government supports the national forest policy statement when in fact I have had given to me a consultancy brief which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEVELOPMENT OF ADVICE TO THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, SPORTS AND TERRITORIES ON A STRATEGY AND PLAN OF ACTION TO PHASE OUT HARVESTING OF THE HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE FORESTS BY THE YEAR 2000: THE ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is the position the minister wants to pursue, let him come clean. There is one part of the brief that I am sure the loggers who were here last week, the people involved in the forest industries and the people involved in the value adding industry would be interested in. We hear a lot about plantations, we hear a lot about value adding and we hear a lot about not exporting. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is envisaged that an appropriate strategy and action plan will need to address:</PARA>

<PARA>That involves a lot more than the woodchipping that we have heard about from the other side. Why, Senator Faulkner, don't you come clean and tell us exactly what your intentions are so that the people out there and the people who were here last week know what your true agenda is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a practising farmer, I have had a long involvement with this industry. I was involved with the Hon. Julian Grill, a Labor minister from Western Australia, back in 1982 in putting together an on-farm forest plantation production policy. We did a lot of work on that at that time. I happen to know a little bit about this. At that time old-growth forests were considered to be 100-years-old or more. The agenda today is that old-growth forests are 20-years-old or older. The ground rules are changing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this policy it means that there will be no more logging carried out once the process begins. That is the position of the government. I ask Senator Burns, who is sitting opposite, and Senator Faulkner to come clean. They should come out and tell the people precisely where they stand. They should not try to pretend that they mean something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We require a bit of decent, old-fashioned honesty from you and for you to tell us what the government's policy is. Senator Faulkner, how do you&mdash;nobody else&mdash;reconcile this departmental brief with the government's position on the national forest policy statement? I make it quite clear that our position on management of the forests is that we support 100 per cent the national forest policy statement. There are no ifs, no buts, no twitches. That is our position. That is quite different from the actions of Senator Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite certain that some of the revelations I have made today would make some government members of this place shudder. I do not know anyone who does not have a love of the forest and who does not enjoy going down to the south-west of Western Australia and seeing the majestic karri and jarrah forests and a host of other things. It is absolutely tragic that we have a minister who turns the clock back the way it has been turned back now and actually destroys the understood procedures. </PARA>

The way to do it is not to write to your state colleague or equivalent&mdash;in this case the Hon.

You are undermining a consistent policy of the previous Labor government in Western Australia, the Court-O'Connor government before that and the current government. That is what you are doing, Minister. Not only do you speak with forked tongue; you behave in the same manner. You have destroyed the credibility of the process. You have done both the timber industry and the environmental movement in this country a lot of damage. Instead of pulling them together and working constructively as a team, you have driven a wedge between them purely and simply for political reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this censure motion was introduced by Senator Ian Macdonald, I listened very carefully because I think it is very serious to have a motion of censure against a minister or anybody in the government. It is something that deserves consideration. While he was talking about his reasons for the censure motion, I was trying to work out what we were censuring the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listed a number of things. Firstly, it seemed to me he was being censured for doing his job&mdash;for looking after the environment. I know it is unusual to have an environment minister who actually does look after the interests of the environment. If you are from Western Australia, it is an utterly alien concept because we have not had environment ministers who really did the job. We have not had an environment minister in this parliament who has been doing his job thoroughly in relation to this matter and other matters for quite some time, certainly outside my experience. So I could not agree with that reason if that was the reason Senator Ian Macdonald was introducing the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason Senator Ian Macdonald seemed to be giving was that the minister for the environment had given money to the voluntary conservation movement. I believe that there has been a reasonably full and open account of the money given. If there are any concerns about the process I am sure we have the ability to scrutinise that process when the documents get tabled. However, if it is just the principle of allowing funding for people when you are asking them to provide some kind of responsible and thoroughgoing analysis and advice, then why should they not receive the funding that allows them to do that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember that it is a voluntary conservation movement. They have to be able to gain the advice of experts and look at matters that are outside their normal jobs. It is outrageous to suggest that they should not receive funding. If the conservation movement had paid Senator Faulkner for doing the assessment, that could be a different matter again. However, I support the fact that the movement was asked to provide some advice to a process. It is a stakeholder in that process and it has a right to see some support for it. It is totally different. We have industry funding. We have industry subsidies. We know that the forestry industries are considerably well subsidised by the community for their operations already. I think it was perfectly appropriate for that to be done. So I did not support the motion on that account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason that Senator Ian Macdonald mentioned got quite close. He said that he was condemning the Minister for the Environment for not succeeding in protecting the old growth and high conservation value forests. That would have to come close to a sympathetic hearing with the greens and with me because I feel that there has not been a sufficient capacity demonstrated by this federal parliament to protect old growth and high conservation value forests. When you go into a process and you identify those high conservation value areas and yet you do not demonstrate any political will to protect them from being logged, from having roads cut through them, from having their conservation values destroyed, then you are failing in a capacity to protect those forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I could have said yes, maybe for that one because there is some merit in the argument that there has been a failure on the part of this minister for the environment to protect the native forests that are being sought for protection. However, it is scarcely fair to put the blame entirely on him because he is part of a cabinet, he is part of a government, and he is part of a political party. It would be the same for the opposition environmental spokesperson. I note that the opposition environment policy has been one of looking at the dangers of clearance. A connection needs to be made between clearance that has destroyed the agricultural capacities of this country and the logging that goes on in our native forest areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next reason that was raised was that there had been incompetent handling of the process. The Minister for the Environment seems to have followed quite closely the process that was laid down in the national forest policy statement. Both the major parties support the national forest policy statement. I cannot say that the Greens do. We have very strong reservations about it because the national forest policy statement has never succeeded in protecting high conservation value forests. It has never acted on its moratorium clause to prevent the logging and destruction of high conservation value forests before they have been properly assessed. I might divert here and say that, if it is going to criticise the minister, the opposition needs to do its homework a bit better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In comments that have been made in various speeches, opposition speakers have shown their lack of comprehension of this area. They laugh when people say forests will be gone forever. Yet that shows that they do not know what forests mean, what forests are and the difference between an old growth forest and a regrowth forest. They laugh when the minister for the environment comes up with the perfectly appropriate term `megadiverse'. Australia is, in the world, a unique example of a megadiverse system. Opposition members laugh when wetlands are talked about as being included in areas of coupes that are for protection. They laugh when there are airstrips in the areas. The reality is that the boundaries of those coupes are not determined by the minister for environment; they are determined by the state forestry agencies. It is not up to the environment movement to determine the boundaries of those coupes. It is simply up to them to work on those boundaries and say whether anything within those boundaries has the values that have been listed in the national forest policy statement as being worthy of protection. So I believe that the process has been handled as competently as it can be but I still have strong reservations about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point was that the minister had divided the community. That is true and it is very sad because there are genuine concerns on both sides of this debate. The government and the opposition need to take the responsible step of stepping back and listening to the truth on both sides. There is no doubt that there are grave concerns for the future of our native forests because of the inroads the woodchipping industry has made into them. There is also no doubt that there are difficulties within the industry amongst the workers who have been losing their jobs for 30 years&mdash;not as a result of the greens or any conservation process but simply because of mechanisation, market forces and the way the industry has been structured. So the division of the community cannot be laid solely at the feet of the environment minister by any means. It lies with all of us to look with respect at the division that has been raised and seek to resolve it in the most positive way possible for all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what I thought the censure motion was about. So I was very relieved when after a while the actual wording was circulated and I received the motion, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek leave to move a motion to censure the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for gross incompetence in the exercise of his ministerial responsibilities in relation to the nomination of forest coupes which has undermined the protection of high conservation areas and put in jeopardy the jobs of forest workers.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought that was very clever phrasing. As Senator Macdonald knows, I have made no secret of the fact that if you have a process which identifies old growth and high conservation value areas without the political will to protect them, then you render them vulnerable. You devise a hit list for the industry so that it knows and, believe me, that is the basis on which the industry has been operating for quite some time now using the information in the CALM/AHC agreement. It has been quite capable of determining those areas which may one day, if it is ever protected, be placed under protection and it has. I can hardly blame them for that. It is their own self-interest that motivates them. They have targeted those areas and they have got to them first. Why would they not go for those areas which they know may not be available later?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To actually identify areas and then fail to protect them is to be responsible for their destruction. I think Senator Macdonald was very clever in putting in that part of the motion, because he knew it would extract a degree of sympathy from me. It is quite definitely the view by Australia's leading forest ecologists that there needs to be better protection of our forests. I incorporated a document into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> during a speech I made yesterday. I note in that document the comments of seven ecologists from all different states of Australia who say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's forests will never be managed sustainably if Governments continue with the present piecemeal approach of assessing individual compartments and coupes. Proper planning and management requires the comprehensive assessment of forests at a regional level.</PARA>
<PARA>They mention that they believe the government's commitment to the national forest policy statement has never been followed through. They also say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of comprehensive regional assessments, the most prudent course of action for the Commonwealth and State Governments to take is to immediately suspend logging in the 1300 compartments nominated by the Federal Environment Minister, Senator John Faulkner. The process by which Senator Faulkner's department determined the 1300 areas likely to have high conservation values was a reasonable and valid process. These 1300 areas represent only a proportion of the native forest scheduled for logging in 1995. The conservation values of these areas, and particularly the 509 compartments to be fast-tracked, must now be determined by a thorough and independent scientific review involving institutions such as CSIRO and universities. Because of the known and potential ecological significance of these forest areas, this review must draw upon the best available information and will require collaboration between governments, scientists and the community.</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a danger in identifying them but not completing the process thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot altogether agree with the second part of the censure motion, which says that the process has put in jeopardy the jobs of forest workers. That does not mean for a moment that we should not all have great sympathy for the plight of workers in that industry. It is a peculiar industry in that a lot of the financial load actually falls not on the industry but on the individual workers. They often have debts for equipment. For example, one logging truck costs $400,000. So in nothing I say do I want to make light of the load that they bear. However, there is increasingly evidence that the workers in the industry have been more jeopardised by the industry itself over the last 30 years than by any conservation strategy, irrespective of whether it has been designed to protect or has, as at present, inadequately protected forest areas from woodchipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from a leading conservationist in Western Australia, Mr Peter Robertson, to show that even those Greens who are pleading for the rescue of old forests from the ravages of woodchipping and logging are not unsympathetic to the plight of the workers. This is what he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our forests belong to ALL Western Australians. The overwhelming majority want our forests protected, not woodchipped. Yet it appears that CALM is deliberately targeting the best remaining unprotected forests in a concerted effort to destroy their values before they can be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We must have a complete moratorium on all road construction and logging activities in any of the National Estate listed forests including Giblett, Hawke, Jane, Peak, Rocky and Sharpe. It is hypocrisy that the Prime Minister calls on poorer nations to stop logging their old-growth forests while escalating the destruction of Australia's forests which are irreplaceable and unique on this planet.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These logging operations are in fact a one-off mining operation and our forests, hundreds of years old, will never fully recover.</PARA>
<PARA>He is the coordinator of the Western Australian Forest Alliance. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past 30 years the timber industry has almost doubled the amount of timber it extracts while halving the number of people it employs. There is a lot of common ground between us and the timber workers. There are alternative strategies for jobs in the timber industry and alternative supplies of wood.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">We continue to maintain our aim, stated on 1 July 1994, that the purpose of our action is to protect the forests AND to lay the groundwork for a sustainable timber industry with sustainable jobs.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>I believe that calls like his are very constructive and positive. They are what this parliament should be engaged in asking of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer&mdash;because of time I will not go into any detail&mdash;to an article by Dr Clive Hamilton of the Australia Institute which analyses the employment impact of the decision to reserve 509 forest coupes. Briefly, the conclusion that is made in this analysis is that the reservation of 509 coupes would not result in any job losses in 1995 unless the state forest management agencies refused to reschedule their planned 1995 operations. The 509 coupes account for approximately five per cent of the remaining stands on woodchipping concessions. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point in this article is that large job losses in the industry over the last 20 years have been due to commercial decisions by timber companies rather than environmental decisions by governments. Dr Hamilton goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.employment in most timber towns depends much less on continued access to native forests than is generally believed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.in the longer term, the employment impact of the 509 decision will be significantly less than redundancies due to continuing structural change in the industry. The smooth transition to a sustainable industry will depend on the implementation of the Regional Forest Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>I have other figures specific to Western Australia that illustrate the remarkable escalation in quantities of chip logs over the last 20 years and the remarkable decline in the number of establishments related to sawmills and the total number of employees. I am happy to provide that information to anybody who would like to see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the two points in the censure motion have some merit. They warrant some consideration and not just dismissal on the political grounds of who one supports or does not support. In relation to the Democrats amendment, I would be prepared to support this censure motion if the name of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories were removed and the name of the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) replaced it. I actually feel that his action has done more to jeopardise the protection of both our high conservation value forests and jobs for workers. He has been unable to see that transition strategies are required rather than an increase in the volume of woodchips to go out of our very important native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more appealing to me would be an amendment to the motion that replaced the name of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories with the name of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I feel that it is the responsibility of this government to look at both sides of the issue and to sort it out in a really constructive way. It should do justice to the conservation issue, which is very important, and the future of those workers in the timber industry who may well be jeopardised by a proper approach to our high conservation forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have been glad to put the Prime Minister's name on the motion and then support the motion, because nobody is now sorting out the issue in a constructive way. We have to put the responsibility for these decisions on the government and the Prime Minister. I believe that the environment minister has done his job. I am not happy with the result and the compromises that have been made for political reasons by the Prime Minister. It is a tragedy that the people who are going to be left to sort it out are the people who are trying to prevent those 509 areas, 222 of which are national estate listed, from being destroyed right now while the government makes up its mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now report on the impact in Western Australia. I mentioned yesterday that in Western Australia the Conservation Council put forward a compromise list of 29 forest blocks for protection. It was not an ambit claim because it had to exclude many heritage listed areas because it lacked sufficient information to warrant their inclusion. Of the 29, Senator Faulkner then recommended that 21 of them be protected, the Minister for Resources listed two and the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has raised that number to 12. As I have already said, that fails to protect them because access to them has not been protected, roads are being made and disturbance is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in Western Australia is a state environment minister who has ordered Western Australian loggers to ignore the bans on logging in the Rosa forest block, south of Nannup. Yesterday CALM logging and road preparation of the Jane forest was prevented only by an injunction that was brought by the local community. That is what it is left to. Instead of the Prime Minister doing this job, it is left to people in the community. But mark my words: the majority of the community do not want our high conservation value forests logged for woodchips. They are very sympathetic to the cries of the workers in that industry, who deserve and demand a transition strategy but they want those high conservation value forests protected. Make no mistake about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a semi-official union picket in place at the Jane forest in Western Australia. I have to point out the plight of some of the local community people in that area. Mr Robert Daubney, who is one of the local people from the Northcliffe community and is from a pioneer farming family, has been involved in a recently formed group, the Friends of Jane Forest, which has been trying to prevent the construction of a logging highway through Jane forest, which is on the national estate and is listed amongst the 509 areas for protection. A press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Robert Daubney, who owns a dairy farm adjoining Jane forest, said that the magnificence of the old growth Karri forest juxtaposed with the devastation caused by the logging road has hardened the resolve of local people to protect one of Northcliffe's greatest natural assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"No studies have ever been done in this area", said Mr Daubney, a descendent of Northcliffe's first European settlers. "Surely we must have learnt something since the thirties. They don't even know what is being destroyed."</PARA>
<PARA>That man, apparently because of his courageous stand, has had a semi-official union picket in place. He has lost 14,000 litres of milk and it has cost him $500 a day. He has had to spill the milk on to his farm because of a blockade by the industry which has prevented him from going about his business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to report that the picket has been lifted and a tanker got through yesterday morning. I am very grateful that some reason has prevailed in that place. I know that people are distressed, and I think it is very important that, as well as the conservationists and the local community getting injunctions to prevent logging in old-growth forest, this government does its job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heartily urge the opposition to reconsider the political opportunism it has taken from this issue and support the government in sorting it out. Whether you want to come out on the side of the workers in the industry or on the side of those who value our forests enough not to see them destroyed, do it with integrity and in such a way that Australia will be a better place and will not suffer from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think you will have gathered from my speech that I do not intend to support this motion to censure the minister for the environment.

The information was all there for Senator Faulkner if he was genuine, if he was not just playing green politics to try to get the second preferences of the Green parties at the next election. That is what it is all about. The process is not genuine. Everybody can see that, including members of the Labor Party caucus. I am disappointed that you cannot see it and cannot understand the need to censure Senator Faulkner for his incompetence in the way he has handled the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken some time to try to explain to Senator Chamarette why the motion should be supported. I do not bother with the Australian Democrats. We all know that the Greens will make a considered judgment on this because they are concerned about the environment and they think these things through. However, you know that with the Democrats the Labor Party just says, `Jump' and they say, `How high?' You know that every time the Labor Party needs a bit of support, needs a vote or two, they just click their fingers to the Democrats and the Democrats will support them as a matter of course. They are in fact the left wing of the Labor Party&mdash;the far left wing, I might say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Brown, the West Australian Greens&mdash;those sorts of people&mdash;do think seriously about this. They work out what they think is best for the environment. We do not always agree with them, but at least they do think about it. But the Democrats think about the politics of it. If the Labor Party wants them to do something, they do it. If the Labor Party says, `Vote with us,' they vote with it. If the Labor Party says `Don't censure Faulkner,' they do not censure Senator Faulkner. The Democrats gave some arguments, but I do not think anyone took any notice of them. They were very difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can never quite understand what Senator Coulter is on about. I think he is looking forward to the thrashing that the Democrats will get at the next election by the Liberal and National Parties, and I suspect by the Greens as well in various southern states, because Senator Coulter can then turn the tables back on Senator Kernot, who knocked him off for the leadership. If the Democrats do as badly next time as everyone thinks they will, maybe Senator Coulter can have another go at being leader. I suspect that, in Senator Coulter's contributions, he was aiding the Democrats' fall so that Senator Kernot will be discredited as the leader and he can have another go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised that the Democrats yet again do what the Labor Party says. I wish Senator Coulter and the Democrats would consider these things. The environment and conservation are very serious matters. I know the green movement, Mr Brown in Tasmania, the West Australian Greens and the Liberal and National Parties very seriously consider these things. They do not just play politics like you people. They have an independent view. We decide these things on merit and do not do just what the Labor Party tells us to do. I am sorry that the Democrats have taken that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, nothing they said requires a response. There are other days when I can defend myself against the things Senator Coulter has said. They were so ridiculous&mdash;and, as I say, no-one takes any notice of Senator Coulter&mdash;that I will not waste the time of this debate in even referring to them any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Crane has indicated our approach to the forestry policy. We support the national forest policy statement. That has been made quite clear. That was our policy at the last election. Senator Crane has quite clearly explained that. I might say that Mr Ian McLachlan, the coalition's environment spokesman, is a very genuine and concerned conservationist. He has put down a policy which I think everyone will concede is a very sensible and caring document and one that shows a genuine commitment to the environment&mdash;not just the type of commitment that Senator Faulkner has in following former Senator Richardson in trying to get the second votes of those who would not normally support the Labor Party. Mr McLachlan's policy is a genuine one. I do not think any serious, fair-minded and sensible person could ever say that the coalition is anything but genuinely concerned for genuine environmental issues and conservation generally. We prove our point. We do it because it needs to be done&mdash;not because there are votes in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly want to touch on the acquittal reports. I suppose they are matters that we will deal with more fully in estimates committee hearings next week. I must say that the pieces of paper that were tabled today just exacerbate the incompetence of the department in the way it has handled all this. I see that the letters referred to are signed by the secretary to the department, Mr Stuart Hamilton&mdash;a man who has become famous for the way he will refuse to give out any information at estimates committee hearings and refuse in any way to assist the process of information gathering. It was he who fought all the way to prevent us from getting information on Mrs Kelly in answering the reasonable, lawful and legitimate questions that were asked. I see from the information he has given today that he is doing the same with Senator Faulkner. I regret that, but I will take that up with him directly in the next estimates committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want Mr Hamilton and Senator Faulkner to tell us why they have deliberately, it appears, not enforced the contracts that were made with the conservation movement and why this parliament is yet again being prevented from seeing how those funds that were granted to the conservation movement were acquitted. It is interesting to note that it seems, from the material tabled, that the only time the department has asked for the acquittals is the day after those acquittals were supposed to be tabled in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter to the conservation groups from the acting secretary of the forest branch which asked them for these acquittal reports is dated 3 February&mdash;the day after Senator Faulkner was ordered by the Senate to table those acquittal reports in this chamber and several days after Senator Faulkner, in a throwaway line, said to us that he had all the acquittal reports. I think that alone deserves censure of Senator Faulkner and his department. It certainly is something that I will pursue further in estimates committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the New South Wales documents and what should have been done. Senator Faulkner has completely demeaned this whole process and brought into disrepute the conservation movement and all those interested in the environment. He has been insensitive to the jobs that his incompetence has caused. For all those reasons, and for the reasons that were very clearly explained in the debate by my colleagues Senator Alston, Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Gibson and Senator Crane, Senator Faulkner should resign or should be sacked. By supporting this censure motion the Senate can assist in the process of getting rid of a minister who has proved himself to be so incompetent. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Wheat Board has been chaired by Clinton Condon for quite some years. He was appointed the chairman in April 1986 but he has been a board member since 1979. Tonight the industry is giving him a dinner, which unfortunately I will not be able to attend. I would like to place on record the work that he has done as chairman of the board. Just quietly, I have not always agreed with him, and I might elucidate on a couple of those points on which we have not always agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has done a good job. He has given a great deal of time and service to the Wheat Board. I wish him a happy retirement out of the industry and hopefully he will enjoy his time away from it. He started off in Queensland as a wheat grower and has spent a lot of time in recent years living in Melbourne. I do not want to be derogatory about the Victorians at all, but really he was living in the purple in the Queensland wheat area, and to go down and live in Melbourne was a sacrifice in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a couple of points about the report. Under the heading `In partnership . . . with the domestic market', it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisation has strengthened its relationship with the stock-feed market by appointing a national feed-grain manager and dedicated merchants in each state.</PARA>
<PARA>With my pecuniary interest as a grower of grain in the north of New South Wales, I find that the Wheat Board quite often undercuts summer crop prices at this time of the year through to June because of contracts it has entered into with the stockfeed market, especially in the feedlot industry. I wonder sometimes whether the Wheat Board has lost its mandate as a single desk seller. If that does change, we would have to think about it very seriously. It is trading on the domestic market, trying to be the best seller of the grain for the producer, and buying grain at the best price to make a profit on the domestic market. It makes me wonder how the Wheat Board can be all things to all people. I believe the Wheat Broad was put there to look after the growers and to put a stable price into the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report the Wheat Board talks about its grain crop proposal, which is going to be subject to ministerial approval and referred to the Trade Practices Commission. At this stage, the Trade Practices Commission does not agree entirely that the Wheat Board could take over the handling authority, or be a partner in the handling authority, because it would become a monopoly. I refer to the Booz Allen report which says that the benefits of the single desk selling system for wheat appear to outweigh the costs at this particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key issue which dictates the future of people in the grain industry, and really the whole grain industry, is to decide whether or not it should continue. I believe it has served us well over the years and I cannot see any reason at this time for doing away with it. When Minister Crean was the minister, he suggested that, when GATT came to fruition, we do away with it. I caution against that because I do not know whether it would be better to keep with what we have got at the moment and not throw the baby out with the bath water because, if we do, we might find we do not get the benefits of the World Trade Organisation reforms, and we will have lost the benefit of single desk selling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some remarks about the Australian Wheat Board. In doing so, I would also like to offer my congratulations to Clinton Condon, the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board. He has been a member of the Wheat Board since 1979, as my colleague Senator Brownhill has said. He has done an excellent job, and I wish to take this opportunity to wish him a very happy retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993-94 annual report of the Australian Wheat Board reveals that the Wheat Board is doing a very good job. Its growers are receiving payments promptly, protein levels are being lifted in the national crop through Australian Wheat Board programs, and 50 per cent of the wheat import growth in our core Asian markets has been captured by Australia, with participation in new feed growing business established in Asia. We have also established ties in Asia by opening an office in Hong Kong, and a partnership with Goodman Fielder and the Vietnam Food Industry Company has been entered into for a new flour mill in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to two areas: the continuing practice of the US to use its export enhancement programs to steal our traditional grain markets in Asia; and the position taken by the Trade Practices Commission to prevent the amalgamation of the Australian Wheat Board with the New South Wales Grain Corp, which also puts under threat the merger between the AWB and Queensland's Grainco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deal firstly with the threat of further US subsidies, it seems that the US has entered a further game of claiming new markets before the cut-in date of 1 July this year, when the Uruguay Round agreement on subsidy reduction comes into effect. The GATT Uruguay Round decision was welcomed by Australian grain growers as putting an end to the damage done to the industry through the US-EC trade war; in particular, the damage done to the Australian grain growers since the introduction of the US EEP program in 1986. That damage has been immense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, it has cost Australian grain growers an 11 per cent reduction in world grain prices, or $300 million a year since 1986. We saw incidents like the Bush Administration in 1992 subsidising its entire export crop to the tune of $1.4 billion. As a result, the US entered our Pakistan and Indian markets and, despite assurances from former President Bush and President Clinton that they would not do so, the US has continued to steal our traditional Asian markets with their highly subsidised export programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an act totally against the spirit of the Uruguay Round, the US dairy export subsidy scheme is stealing $20 million of our Asian dairy market before crunch time on 1 July. Today Senator McMullan acknowledged that they may do the same with our traditional Asian wheat markets. The US action must be stopped, and the Australian government should pull out all shots available to it to prevent the US treating their allies in this appalling way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great threat to the future of the grains industry lies in the Trade Practices Commission's tunnel vision in preventing the further commercial growth of the grower owned Australian industry. I know it took the industry by surprise to have the merger of the AWB and the grain corp rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tabling of this report comes a matter of days after the issue of a major report into the grains industry commissioned by the industry itself. The Booz Allen and Hamilton report points out that the Australian Wheat Board would need to undergo significant changes and broaden its narrow business base if, when the market was deregulated, it were to survive against companies like US giant ConAgra, which has offices in 26 countries, sales of $US6.9 billion, 34 flour mills and 4.6 million tonnes of storage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are told that our companies have to be competitive. We are facing competition such as Cargill, which has received over $1.2 billion in US EEP subsidies over the last six years. The other company involved was Louis Dreyfus, a French based company, which received nearly $1 billion of EC subsidies. Yet the Trade Practices Commission is not allowing the efficiencies to be promoted in the grain industry. That would have let the amalgamations take place and that would have allowed the wheat board to be competitive against these hugely subsidised companies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The wine industry and the grape growing industry are great employers of people. They are good for tourism and value adding but, unfortunately, they are the milch cow of this government. Basically, they have the problem of high interest rates that impact so heavily on the industries because they have a long lead time. They have the problem of first of all planting their vines, then they have four years before they come into good production. It costs about $10,000 an acre to get a vineyard going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With interest rates like they are, and we were told at the conference in the last couple of days that they are likely to rise another three per cent, they will impact very heavily on the wine industry. Once the producers have grown their grape&mdash;it takes a year to grow the grape&mdash;they have to crush it, put it into bottles, then they have to put away the good wines that we all enjoy drinking so much to mature. The interest is accruing the whole time on the industry. There is a tax as well on the stock that is actually put down. So there is a long lead time, and high interest rates will kill this industry which gives us so much enjoyment and gives us so much export income as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high value of the dollar at the moment is causing problems for the wine industry as far as exports are concerned, and there is also a wine tax. This government says, `Hear, hear! The wine industry is good for us and wine is good for our health.' But the government is going to raise the wine tax from 24 to 26 per cent. R&amp;D, which this report is all about, has always been dollar for dollar. It is mooted, talked about, that this government is most probably going to change that. So instead of there being dollar for dollar for R&amp;D, the government might put in $1 for every $4 that the industry puts in. Maybe the parliamentary secretary might be able to deny that in a moment. </PARA>

Wholesale taxes have gone from something like $3 billion tax take to nearly $13 billion tax take in the time this Labor government has been in power. Wholesale taxes impose such a big cost on the transport industry because everything in the transport industry is tied up with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is talking about raising fuel excise again and maybe it will raise it again. That is another impost on the wine industry. As well as all those problems, competition is coming on stream from Chile. Chile has resewn all its vines, the more modern type vines. South Africa is coming onto the market now as well. Another big competitor to the Australian wine industry is New Zealand just across the Tasman. Of course there are improved techniques in Europe and things are freeing up there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the wine industry is an industry we think we should look after. I believe we should. This side of the chamber has an interest in it.

I think there are two important aspects to the issues that have just been touched on. Firstly, an Industry Commission report is currently being prepared, which will be released in early March, which was commissioned as a consequence of the controversy that arose over the budget outcomes and process of 1993. That report is looking at a range of issues: the tax structure of the industry and the management structure of the industry&mdash;for example, whether the Wine and Brandy Corporation should be combined with the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation into a super corporation. There will be recommendations on those issues in March.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is public input into the Industry Commission's report on R&amp;D, and that will be finalised in June. Therefore, for this year at least, there will not be any change to the R&amp;D arrangements even if the government decided to take it up. I will certainly go on record, and I am speaking for myself, as saying that I do not agree with the Industry Commission recommendations on R&amp;D. I think the wine industry and a number of agricultural industries do need that continued ongoing research. One area where I have a role is in the horticultural area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In question time today the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) answered a dorothy dix question regarding the issue of Russian authorities launching a missile from Australian soil under a proposal by the Australian Space Office. In answering that dorothy dix question, the minister attacked a press statement which I put out last week, on 2 February, and a subsequent newspaper article that eventuated from that press release. He falsely attacked both my press release and that newspaper article. I think it is important to note that Senator Schacht continues to mislead this chamber about the true nature of this proposed launch of a Russian missile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister was quick to espouse the virtues of wide industry support for this bizarre plan, but what he has failed to tell us is that the proposal has been rejected by two of the leading industry groups&mdash;BHP and Transfield&mdash;who declined to attend a meeting in Adelaide to discuss this very project. Such was the lunacy of the project and the proposal that even these two major space industry companies are unenthusiastic about the government's plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht claimed that my allegations of secrecy regarding this proposal are spurious. The fact is, had it not been for my efforts in uncovering the proposal, Senator Schacht would still be trying to keep a lid on the project because of its political sensitivity. He knows full well that industry groups think very poorly of the Russian involvement, not to mention the fact that if this project were to go ahead Australia would be in breach of the missile technology control agreement, the MTCR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the minister that Australia's involvement with the MTCR agreement is to prevent sensitive missile technology from falling into the wrong hands, such as hostile countries. Russia is not a signatory to that agreement and Australia's involvement under the Australian Space Office's proposal would result in our breaching this agreement with the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht is also attempting to play down the significance of the Russians bringing in one of their START mobile missile launchers to fire a missile into orbit over Indonesia and Malaysia. It is somewhat amusing that the minister tries to couch the term `missile' in a press release which he put out also on 2 February, in response to my press release and which he again mentioned in his answer today, calling it instead a `START space vehicle'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It really would be a joke if it were not so serious, Senator O'Chee. Anyone in their right mind would know that the actual vehicle he is talking about is a Russian START missile, which has military applications. The only minor difference is the software and a space re-entry vehicle. The fact remains that Senator Schacht is not telling the whole truth because he has been caught out embarking upon a most dangerous and bizarre space proposal which has serious implications for our Asian neighbours and for the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to space, Schacht is lost. Everything the space minister touches either gets lost in space, as we have seen recently, or crashes to the ground. We have seen that not only with his involvement with the space industry but also with the customs department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My support for the revitalisation of the space industry in Australia, particularly with a base in South Australia, is crystal clear and has been so ever since I served on the Senate inquiry into this matter two or three years ago, an inquiry on which Senator Schacht also served. But the revitalisation of the space industry in Australia will never happen under this government which, to date, has failed absolutely to show any support for the space industry by failing to provide the required funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it is crystal clear&mdash;and it was right from the time that Senate committee conducted its investigations and made its report&mdash;that the only way we are going to get a space industry off the ground in Australia is if the government provides the funding for the first two rockets. Then, and only then, will those with expertise in the space industry in the private sector, who would seek to launch satellites and so on, make a commitment to invest private funds in this industry. That has been the experience right around the world: unless a government is prepared to make a commitment, then you simply do not have a space industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before Christmas we saw Senator Schacht take his proposal from the Australian Space Office to the cabinet, and it was rejected out of hand. The proposal for government support to get this industry off the ground in Australia was rejected out of hand. Ever since then we have seen the minister scrambling around Australia trying to encourage the private sector to invest its funds in this industry without any commitment whatsoever from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not appreciate this half-baked attempt by Senator Schacht to mislead both the public and honourable senators about his dismal performance. This minister, who prides himself on being the minister for space, seems hell-bent on taking the Australian Space Office down the road to destruction, to try and get a few runs on the board through this very dangerous proposal so that he can then perhaps go back to the government and see if he can make a better fist of obtaining the necessary funds to revitalise this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, he will fail in that regard. The only way we will succeed in revitalising this industry is if the government determines that it is prepared to make a commitment and provide that initial funding. Then you will see the private sector only too willing to come to the party and be actively involved.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the government's response to recommendations made by the Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization was that it did not accept the recommendation of the committee that provision should be made for an appeal to the tribunal by any person aggrieved by a decision of an agency head. The government response stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not accepted in relation to making provision for appeal from an access decision of an agency head. There is already suitable provision for the review of decisions relating to employment of Commonwealth employees. They have a right under Division 3 of Part III of the Public Service Regulations to request the agency head to review a decision.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not say on what basis the agency head must review it. It does not say, for example, that the agency head must at least have the decency to interview the person aggrieved or to hear him or her, or his or her legal representatives, on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in the case of Austrade, the agency head gave what is farcically referred to as `a review of a decision' without interviewing the aggrieved person. The decision was made overnight in response to a submission made by the aggrieved person on one day, and a letter went out the following day purporting to be the result of a review by the agency head. Anyway, I will read on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to request the agency head to review a decision (including security clearance decisions). If the complainant is still dissatisfied, he or she may apply to the Merit Protection and Review Agency . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. That is simple bunkum. I can establish that by reading this extract of a Merit Protection and Review Agency decision in relation to what appears to me to have been a disgraceful decision on security matters relating to an individual. The Merit Protection and Review Agency quite properly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the main question for MPRA is whether the decision to terminate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this gentleman's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">employment with AUSTRADE was fair and equitable and taken or made in accordance with sound personnel management practices . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is its view. The MPRA then goes on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.. rather than whether&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the gentleman&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is in fact a person qualified for a security clearance.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the appeal mechanism does not deal with the substance of the problem, which is whether or not the aggrieved person qualified for a security clearance. In other words, the system that is established to protect the rights of people subject to security clearance examinations, and who fail that examination for one reason or another, does not apply to those agencies that operate their own security clearance arrangements. I must say I am intrigued to know why Austrade feels the need to run its own little empire in this matter, but it is extraordinary that in such a situation those rights are wiped out. There is a farcical proposition that an agency head can `review' the problem without even hearing the aggrieved person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that I have no idea of the merits or otherwise of this person's security status or standing, although I have to say that what I have read in the Merit Protection and Review Agency report leads me to the view that this is a particularly sloppy and incompetent exercise by Austrade. I notice that the MPRA says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the security business is concerned, it may well be desirable for the jurisdiction of the Security Appeals Tribunal (or, possibly, that of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal) to be expanded to include appeals against decisions of agency heads in relation to security clearances . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I say amen to all that, if we are going to have this kind of activity. I am not saying that the actions of the agency are mendacious; all I am saying is that it is self-evidently incompetent and improper in terms of preventing an aggrieved person having the same rights of access as exist elsewhere. It is intriguing to note that the Merit Protection and Review Agency says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was not appropriate for MPRA to request that this matter be first re-investigated by AUSTRADE, as would normally be the case with the general run of grievances handled under the Public Service regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>This is despite the fact that the review by the head of the agency was, self-evidently, grossly inadequate and grossly improper. I should then add another point made by MPRA in its report to this individual:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979</EMPHASIS> regulates ASIO's role and makes provision for independent review, by the Security Appeals Tribunal, of ASIO's security assessments but does not generally apply to actions by other Commonwealth departments and agencies . . . ASIO provides advice when requested in accordance with Part IV of its Act, but the heads of Commonwealth departments and agencies alone are responsible for access decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>That means they have a particular need to ensure that the rights of individuals, which are protected in relation to ASIO assessments, are equally protected in relation to their own. Mr Evans of Austrade has failed to protect the rights of one of his employees. The Merit Protection and Review Agency then goes on to reveal what is clearly an absurd situation in which Austrade appointed a person to a job, subject to his security clearance, and it was a long time after that appointment that the security clearance was ultimately refused. I might say that there was deceptive device by</PARA>
<PARA>Austrade. It had a second interview with the person involved at which, on 1 September 1994, he was told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the [further] interview is a routine procedure to finalise the security clearance arrangements . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Instead of that, in fact, he was vigorously interviewed for eight hours with a 10-minute break. This kind of straight dishonesty by Austrade is unpardonable. What I notice it does say is that this man's employment relationship with Austrade has now been irreparably damaged, according to the MPRA. It says that surely Austrade can improve its situation where it provides security clearances, or does the work on a matter of security clearance, before it employs the person. But this man's reputation has been destroyed by an incompetent administration, by an Austrade organisation which does not provide the same protection to other Commonwealth employees and which I believe has behaved disgracefully. I have not revealed the name of the person involved because I do not want to add further damage to his reputation that this, I believe, totally disgraceful behaviour by Austrade has already done to him. </PARA>
