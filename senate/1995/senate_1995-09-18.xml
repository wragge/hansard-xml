<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst he is here, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I ask: if Australia is, as the World Bank would have us believe, potentially the world's richest nation, why, under the leadership of Mr Keating, the new paramount chief, do we have a 28 per cent youth unemployment record; 753,000 Australians looking for a job; the equivalent of $10,000 foreign debt for each man, woman and child in this country; a current account deficit of banana republic proportions; mortgages on many houses which now exceed the value of those houses; and the highest real interest rates in the developed world? Doesn't it further demonstrate how, under Mr Keating, with his hands on the levers for nearly 13 years, Labor has so failed ordinary Australians, who have in fact grown poorer under Mr Keating's administration?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must have come as a terrible shock to the opposition to read the press reports this morning about the wealth base of this country because it does put into remarkably stark context some of the doomsaying that we have been hearing for transparent political reasons for so long.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that on the World Bank calculations you are talking about per capita wealth by Australians of something over $1.1 million. That is the wealth entitlement for every man, woman and child&mdash;to coin a phrase&mdash;in this country. If you do not like the reality of that kind of analysis, if you think that is artificial, how artificial is it to compare the debt figure of $10,000&mdash;as compared to $1.1 million&mdash;which you claim is the debt burden for every individual Australian?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the truth of the matter is that there is no such thing as a debt burden upon individual Australians. There is a debt burden upon a great many private enterprises in this country because they have borrowed the capital from overseas&mdash;and very large swags of capital overseas&mdash;in order to put to work the productive investments that have made this country the wealthy country that it is and the country that it is in terms of the standard of living of ordinary Australians, which puts us in very good shape indeed by any international comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt that this country owes, which Senator Hill keeps referring to, is overwhelmingly private sector debt used for productive purposes. It is not owed in any sense by governments and it is not owed in any sense by taxpayers. The wealth is a reality, as the World Bank has acknowledged, and we are right up there on top of the tree. In comparison to that wealth, and given our capacity to service the kind of debt that we have as easily as we can with the level of exports that we are presently generating, from that point of view&mdash;from the balance sheet point of view&mdash;the position of ordinary Australians is very good indeed and, historically, as good I think as it has ever been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is not only the balance sheet part of the equation that matters. What matters when you are determining the health of the economy is all the rest of the dynamic current income considerations. Here we are talking about an economy that is growing at a sustainable rate of just under four per cent, which puts us right at the top of the OECD tree. We are talking about an economy that is doing that at the same time as maintaining a sustainable inflation rate of around three per cent, which puts us in an admirable long-term position to maximise the returns for ordinary Australians of this economic growth that we have been experiencing now for an unprecedented 16 quarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about interest rates, which are not a disincentive to industrial investment in the way they have been in the past because they are now running at among the lowest levels for decades. That is also the case for the housing side of the equation. No-one wants to see those rates increasing, but there is no sign whatsoever that they will, given the basic underlying health of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story of employment and unemployment is again a stunningly successful one in terms of the extent to which we have met the promises that we have made&mdash;not only met them, but overwhelmingly exceeded those promises. Five hundred thousand new jobs, we said, in the course of this particular government. Well 2 1/2 years into the government, 675,000 new jobs; a very significant diminution in the unemployment rate; and a very significant improvement in the situation so far as long-term unemployed are concerned&mdash;youth unemployed in particular. This is a problem which we have all acknowledged. It was the central problem in the Australian economy and it is a problem that we have been dealing with in ways that the figures amply reveal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So every which way you look at it&mdash;when you look at the quality of the investment, the profitability of the private sector which is necessary to sustain that investment and every other indicator&mdash;there is no substance whatsoever to Senator Hill's question. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every developed economy in the world has had a significant problem in recent years with unemployment. Every developed economy in the world has had a significant problem with youth unemployment.

They have made a very significant difference already to those out of work, and the figures are there to prove it&mdash;with nearly 200,000 of the long-term unemployed back to work and 675,000 jobs created.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, and it relates to the continuing drought, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. Minister, can you advise if you have received any evidence at this stage that the nucleus of the Australian core breeding herds are under serious threat?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I know what you think about fodder subsidies, Senator Panizza, and it is not what the shadow minister thinks. You have been kind enough to go on the public record in this chamber with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I answer the particularities of the question, I do want to draw the Senate's attention to the extremely useful rain experienced in much of New South Wales over the weekend. For those who have received it, it has been very effective. The quite gentle but persistent rain has certainly guaranteed that a lot of people who would not have got crops harvested will now do so. One can only hope that it does signal a return to a regular spring weather pattern, particularly for those wheat growers who desperately need this sort of rain over the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the core breeding herd and the destocking of that herd and the need to introduce fodder subsidies in order to maintain it, I was quite dismayed to read the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, on a drought trip recently in New South Wales. He said that the coalition would reintroduce fodder subsidies because of the massive problem of the reduction in the national breeding herd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that there is simply no evidence that this is so. During the present drought, ABARE expected the Australian cattle herd to fall from 25.3 million head in 1991-92 to 24 million head in 1994-95. Preliminary results from the agricultural census for the 1994-95 season show that, contrary to expectations and contrary to the advice that Mr Howard is obviously receiving, the Australian cattle herd has increased over the drought years from 25.2 million head in March 1993 to 26.2 million head at March this year. The final census results are expected next month. These figures are particularly relevant when you consider that, when the fodder subsidy proposal was raised about a year ago by John Anderson, we costed the proposal at that time at somewhere in the vicinity of $50 million a month to finance&mdash;that is simply the fodder subsidy on its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final census on those herd numbers is expected next month, but I was dismayed to hear Mr Howard say that the coalition would introduce what was a sadly rorted and misguided scheme when it was brought in by the last conservative government on the basis of a reduction in the national breeding herd. That is not only wrong&mdash;the herd has increased in size, not decreased, over the drought. I believe the federal opposition leader displayed a dangerous ignorance of the real situation when he made this statement. I might add that people who do know something about primary industry, like Senator Panizza, have publicly advocated their opposition to things like fodder subsidies on previous occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time this matter was examined&mdash;that is, what the results of fodder subsidies were when they were introduced; that massive cost to the Australian taxpayers&mdash;the results of that examination concluded that not only were they rorted to the back teeth, because they were not discriminatory, but they also increased the severity of future droughts by lowering the incentive for farmers to adopt their own support strategies to the great detriment of the environment. That, apart from the financial side of it, is something, I would think, that has to be carefully considered by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A scheme that discourages self-reliance, exacerbates land degradation and has been subject to widespread rorts in the past is not something which this government would consider reintroducing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The federal opposition leader told farmers in Dubbo that the coalition's policy would embrace the drought relief blueprint released last year by John Anderson but would also retain current government federal policies. In fact, to quote Mr Howard&mdash;and I have done it before&mdash;he said, `Our policy will pick up the approach of the government.' We are not considering returning drought to the national disaster relief arrangements where assistance was granted to all producers, regardless of their need or of their current and long-term financial status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that drought administration has been taken out of the natural disaster relief arrangements, I point out again, has only recently been reconfirmed by all primary industry ministers in Australia. Only a short time ago at the ARMCANZ meeting in Perth all primary industry ministers, both Labor and conservative&mdash;regardless of their political affiliations&mdash;reconfirmed their support for the national drought policy, which the coalition now says it will tear to pieces.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of the employees of ANL, whom the coalition seems to have scant regard for, is being carefully handled by the government at the moment and the future of ANL will continue to be advanced. Regrettably, ANL has undergone quite severe losses, largely as a result, as the Senate has already been advised, of the depredations of very large fleets of freighters now being operated around the world both from the former Soviet Union and from China. These fleets are cutting rates to the bone as a result of the need to obtain foreign currency. As a result of those depredations on ANL, the company did undergo an escalation of those losses in just the past few years. Therefore, it is essential that the future of ANL is handled carefully for the benefit of the employees of the organisation as well as for the company itself. That is a matter that is being taken in hand by the government at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murphy for his question. I am very pleased to be able to report that for four and a half days last week in Adelaide there were a number of major events dealing with small business in Australia and in the APEC region. Since the formation of APEC we had the first full ministerial meeting of APEC ministers held in Australia. I am pleased that it was for ministers responsible for small and medium enterprises. Eighteen ministers attended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had, in conjunction with that, an APEC opportunity at which nearly 800 SMEs from around the APEC region, including nearly 200 from the 17 economies other than our own, were represented. Just over 500 Australian SMEs attended. Through the assistance of the export access program and participation in APB-NET, those SMEs were matched up and were encouraged to network and create business alliances so that they could show that they could do international business, international trade even though they are small and medium sized businesses. The APEC opportunity was an outstanding success and I want to pay tribute in particular to the support of the ACCI and their subsidiary, APB-NET, plus all the other business organisations in APEC that arranged to send representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial meeting had two very distinct features that are of note. First of all, without reservation the ministers unanimously carried a resolution and issued a communique committing themselves to support the Bogor declaration of free trade for mature economies by 2010 and for developing economies by 2020. What was fascinating was the input of the business communities from all the APEC economies. They themselves recognised that SMEs have a greater advantage for developing free trade in our region than any other sector and were very positive in encouraging all ministers present to take the same attitude. Through the two days of discussion at the ministerial meeting those views were very strongly put.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another unique feature of the ministerial meeting that I am not aware happens at other international ministerial meetings was that SME representatives from each of the economies were invited to join the ministerial discussion for a session of over two hours at which SME representatives spoke directly to ministers about the policy developments they wanted throughout APEC and the issues they wanted APEC to deal with. The specific business forum and APB-NET made detailed submissions which were circulated publicly about the changes they wanted made and the policy developments and arrangements that would encourage free trade and economic growth in the APEC region. Ministers responded to those suggestions and many of them were incorporated in the final communique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the biggest international ministerial meeting in Adelaide's history. It was one of the biggest held in Australia and the first APEC ministerial meeting. The 700 SMEs that attended, from what I have been told, formed the biggest gathering of international SMEs in Australia's history. Combining the two was a significant event, not just for Adelaide and Australia, but for APEC itself, in which we had a commitment to the free trade objectives of Bogor. I believe that will become a major development for SMEs. I conclude by saying that the next ministerial meeting will be held in September next year in the Philippines. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Minister, President Chirac had a fair point, didn't he, when he said, `If the Australian government is so outraged by the nuclear issue, I would have thought they wouldn't be selling uranium.' Doesn't this highlight the hypocrisy, or at least ambivalence, in Australia's policy, particularly following the reported comments of President Chirac that Australian uranium is going into French bombs? Could this be a case of our reaping what we have sown since the resumption of uranium exports to France in 1987?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that, from some points of view, President Chirac's statement about Australian uranium is one of the more disingenuous of those that have been uttered in recent times. He not only knows perfectly well that if Australia takes unilateral action to sever our uranium contacts we will be in the position of having to make very substantial compensation payments to our own uranium producers, in the order of some $80 million, for the duration of the contracts; he also knows perfectly well, or his advisers and his industry certainly know very well, that France stands to make a windfall gain of $30 million to $40 million as a result of being able to buy, currently, uranium on the world market at lower prices than it is presently contracted to pay. So there is a spectacular element of economic self-interest in this which one should appreciate at the outset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to make about President Chirac's statement and, indeed, those of other French ministers&mdash;defence minister Millon among them&mdash;is that, either because they have been uninformed or because of some other reason, they have fundamentally mis-stated the reality of the conditions of supply of Australian uranium to France. The reality is that Australian uranium be supplied pursuant to the safeguard system. It means that there is an absolute guarantee to the extent that one can guarantee it, pursuant to the safeguard system as it presently operates, and which does govern the whole control of uranium supplies worldwide, that there is no Australian uranium, in the sense that the safeguard system operates, going into nuclear weapons production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is the case that the French are saying that their uranium supplies from Australia are not properly subjected to the safeguard arrangements that we have entered into treaty arrangements to guarantee, they are immediately drawing a question mark about all of their sources of uranium supply from elsewhere around the world and fundamentally putting at risk the operation of that safeguard system, and thereby putting at risk the whole nuclear non-proliferation treaty process. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is a very carefully balanced exercise. It involves a trade-off between the interests of those who possess nuclear technology and the materials to supply the use of that technology and those who do not.</PARA>

I know you do not like the idea of nuclear power production around the place, but that particular willingness to make available nuclear technology for power production for peaceful purposes, and that particular willingness on the part of those countries which had the technology or the raw materials to make available that technology and raw materials to those countries which did not, was the price we have paid for ensuring that we do not have something like 30 countries now possessing nuclear weapons.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the nature of the deal, and the international safeguard system to ensure that uranium and other technology cannot be applied for other than peaceful purposes is the essence of that continued system. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government has run a stunningly successful campaign to attract international companies to set up their regional headquarters in Australia. Since we kicked off that campaign in September 1993 about 160 international corporations have chosen Australia over other locations in this region for their regional headquarters. They have invested $1.7 billion in doing so and employed 5,500 Australians to staff their offices.</PARA></TALK.START>

This country has a very high quality science and technology base and very high quality skills in science and technology, and can deliver a product much cheaper. The results of that survey show that if you take, for example, a research and development facility employing 30 people at an average cost in Australia of $2.4 million per year&mdash;that is, covering staff, industrial rental, equipment, consumable and administrative costs&mdash;and compared it with the cost of doing that R&amp;D elsewhere, if it were in Japan it would cost $6.2 million, or 2 1/2 times as much; if it were in France, Hong Kong or Germany, it would cost twice as much; if it were in the USA or Singapore, it would cost 45 per cent more; if it were in the UK, Taiwan or South Korea, it would cost 25 per cent more.</PARA>

When you add in the high quality research base that we have in our universities, in the CSIRO and other science institutions, and in the CRCs that we have successfully managed to establish under our government, as well as in private sector research and development, you have a critical mass here of a science community that can deliver a world class product on time, to quality, but substantially below the price.</PARA>

I ask: is this agreement an official Australian position, or is it just an agreement by the Australian delegation to the conference? Will the minister now concede that, contrary to the comments he made in response to Senator Bourne on 28 August in which he claimed `there is no prospect of achieving a total ban on all classes of landmines at this stage', the women's conference outcome proved that such an agreement is a realistic aim? Will the Australian government now be pushing in Geneva for a total ban on all landmines?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hate to have to advise Senator Margetts but there is a considerable distance between getting a resolution out of a conference like the Beijing women's conference and actually getting governments to sign up to the kind of treaty that would produce that particular result, particularly when at the moment there simply have been no humane and viable alternatives to landmines which have yet been developed and when you have the overwhelming number of defence forces around the world utterly unwilling to contemplate any change of that particular kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances and recognising that reality, what Australia has been really trying extremely hard to do, and with I think some present prospects of success, is to achieve what we think is a realistic objective; namely, to ban absolutely any anti-personnel landmines that are not self-destructing or self-neutralising in their character, thus removing, if we could achieve that result, what is overwhelmingly the problem about landmines at the moment, with them being sown indiscriminately, not subsequently gathered up, and creating ongoing tragedy potential as a result. If we can achieve bans of the kind that we are talking about and, accompanying that, a ban on the sale of landmines to any country around the world which does not commit itself to the Inhumane Weapons Convention and the kind of restrictions we are talking about, we will have made a phenomenal step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular exercise in Beijing was subject to one or two misunderstandings along the way&mdash;I think by Senator Margetts. The particular stage of the conference at which this resolution was negotiated was a stage involving official delegations, not the non-government organisations, and as such it did represent input from governments as such&mdash;governments for the purpose of this conference. I can assure you, if there was any chance of some of those propositions extending more generally, as is the case in other areas, that is one thing, but I do not think there is much prospect, for reasons I have already mentioned, of extending them into the defence area. But let us hope that that might be achievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The instructions of the government to the delegation in this respect were to make known our reservations about certain aspects of the resolution as it was originally put, but under no circumstances to stand aside and to refuse to join a consensus. The exercise that was embarked upon by one rather enthusiastic delegate in moving an amendment and so on and throwing that part of the discussion into uncertainty at some stage was not an exercise that was mandated, directed, required or wanted by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this government would be absolutely delighted if we could make landmines disappear from the face of the universe. The way in which they have been deployed in the past and the way in which they are continuing to be deployed right now creates the appalling potential for and the appalling reality of human tragedy. I have been to Cambodia. I have seen the number of people without limbs. I know of the way in which this tragedy is operating in so many other countries. I am working very hard, as is the government, to try to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we genuinely believe that an absolute ban on all forms of landmines was achievable and that there was some sort of viable and humane alternative that would meet the needs of defence forces for appropriate defensive weaponry, we would be the first country in the world to leap in and support that.

Australia ceased importing and manufacturing halons in Australia in 1992 which, of course, was ahead of our obligations under the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. Australia has been at the forefront of international efforts to mitigate damage already done to the ozone layer and also to minimise future damage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday, on the eve of International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, I launched a new program which I think is a further example of how the government, with strong cooperation from industry and state and territory governments, can continue to move beyond our international obligations and lead the way to safeguard the ozone layer. The halon withdrawal awareness campaign, which I launched last Friday, asked people to hand in their halon fire extinguishers to their local fire stations or to a depot of the national halon bank, which is run by the Department of Administrative Services Centre for Environmental Management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Halon fire extinguishers are easily recognised by their bright yellow colour, and I would be urging anyone who had one of those fire extinguishers to hand them into the authorities I have mentioned. We are asking people to hand in the extinguishers, and the states and territories are regulating the phase-out of halon fire suppression systems, except for some essential areas where there are no proven alternatives because, of course, they are extremely potent ozone depleting substances; in fact, they are up to 16 times more destructive than CFCs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the latest information we have from the World Meteorological Organisation suggests that this year's ozone hole could be worse than ever, there is no doubt that the Montreal protocol measures are working. Emissions of several major ozone depleting substances have fallen considerably. The CSIRO has found that chlorine levels in the lower atmosphere could soon stabilise and then decline. So while ozone destruction will get worse before it gets better, because it takes up to five years for destructive chemicals to reach the stratosphere, ozone depletion should peak during the next few years and then start to slow down in the early part of the next century. Based on these forecasts and provided that international action does proceed as is planned, the ozone layer will be at its most damaged around the turn of the century but should recover in about 50 years time.</PARA>

Has the minister noted that the bank for the first time has at long last recognised the important difference between capital asset and cash flow accounting, something done by every company and institution other than national governments, which have never kept a comprehensive balance sheet? What has your government done to establish both capital and cash flow national accounting?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator McGauran this day, relating to child-care accreditation guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the child-care centre in Newcastle which has been downgraded, having regard to accreditation principle No. 2. It states that staff must treat all children equally and try to accommodate their individual needs and that they must respect diversity of background. Given that the federal parliament presumably operates on this principle also, and that it opens every day with the Lord's prayer, I wonder whether the minister will eventually move to have this tradition abolished. Although I take note of what Senator Crowley had to say regarding the way in which the accreditation principles have been applied, this is simply another example of the very draconian nature of this government's child-care accreditation plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Needless to say, the child-care centre in question declined to be named as it was afraid it would be denied accreditation altogether. This fear is very widespread. It gives the lie to the number of centres which are accredited. Although I know perfectly well that Senator Crowley will say that 99 per cent of centres have now agreed to become accredited, this is because their fee relief will be withdrawn if they are not accredited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under what pressure are they now operating? What type of coercion is inflicted on centres to ensure their compliance with the government's regulations? We know quite well that, as 30 June approached, the Child Care Accreditation Council proceeded to ring centres and ask them when they were going to get their accreditation notices in. Centres are certainly operating under a high degree of coercion and pressure. The coercion is the fear of losing fee relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited a number of child-care centres in Victoria last week, and they all indicated to me how stressful the accreditation process was. One centre owner was forced to pay $1,000 to have her centre's policy drawn up. She had already tried to do this within existing staff time. Because this simply could not be fulfilled within normal staff hours, the entire staff and the centre owner eventually all went away for the weekend to go through the process of working through the accreditation handbook and achieving their self-study regulations. The same centre owner talked about the incredible drain on her staff during their self-evaluation period and how damaging the process was on staff relations. If this subject is so important to you, Senator Crowley, I wonder why you are leaving the chamber while this matter is being discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that was raised with me was the fear one centre owner had of losing the operational subsidy. Although Senator Crowley has told me that there is no suggestion that operational subsidies are to be cut, I would draw to her attention the fact that this rumour is circulating again and again through the industry. In view of the changes that have been inflicted on the industry over the last couple of years under this government, particularly under Senator Crowley's stewardship of the family services portfolio, it indicates the high level of economic uncertainty under which child-care centres are operating. I would appreciate her reiteration of the assurance that operational subsidies will not be cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, I wonder when Senator Crowley will see fit to relinquish this portfolio because she is making mistake after mistake in her administration of it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to methods of national accounting and a World Bank report on national net worth.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a well established practice in every business in this country and throughout the world that they keep at least two accounts: a capital account, in which they keep the value of buildings and equipment which they own, and a cash flow account. When a business sells off part of its capital equipment, it shows that as a transfer of wealth from the capital account to the cash flow account. That is standard accounting practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this country shares with most other countries the failure to properly develop a national capital account. For example, when we chop down trees in a forest&mdash;they are capital assets; they are cash in the bank, as it were, which all people in Australia own&mdash;and we sell them off overseas as woodchips or as sawn timber, money appears in the cash flow account. However, because of our faulty accounting methods, we fail to show that what we have done is to simply transfer wealth from the capital account to the cash flow account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can have a system, and we have had in this country for a long time, in which the country can appear to be becoming more and more wealthy when, in fact, it is simply running down the capital assets which the country as a whole owns&mdash;not just this generation, but all future generations as well&mdash;and showing that as a gain in wealth in its cash flow. Moreover, this government is not only doing that; it is frittering away that wealth that is derived from the exploitation of its capital assets and not re-establishing capital assets, but rather using it as immediate expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that the government is able to claim, as this government has done and, indeed, as Senator Gareth Evans has done on frequent occasions, and as he did today in answer to an earlier question by Senator Hill based on the same material&mdash;and I have to say that Senator Hill clearly misunderstands what the World Bank is on about&mdash;that the country is becoming better off because its GDP is increasing. There have been a number of studies done, not just the ABS study that Senator Evans handed to me earlier, which seek to sort this material far more comprehensively than the ABS&mdash;if I had time, I would comment on the inadequacy of this study&mdash;and which show that, since the mid-1970s, in country after country, even though the GDP as presently measured is increasing, when you start to take out those factors of decline in the capital asset base on which that growth is based, you find that countries are becoming worse off. These studies are being done in America and in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It accords with what average people feel, what they feel in their bones. They feel that there is something wrong when Mr Keating says, `You are better off. You have never had it so good. The country is becoming better off. You personally are better off.' Part of the reason is that we are seeing a steady decline in that capital base which is simply being turned into cash flow. The establishment of comprehensive national accounts is desperately needed, both in this country and in most other countries: a national capital account; a GDP account which disaggregates the costs from the benefits&mdash;and that is another major flaw; and an accounting system which looks specifically at human welfare and human wellbeing separately from simply the dollar value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can just briefly mention one of the things in the report that Senator Evans handed me today. The ABS is making the mistake of discounting the future. This is one of the ways in which it is doing its accounting. Whenever you put a discount rate into the assessment of the future value of natural resources, you are effectively discounting the future, discounting the value to future generations of those natural resources&mdash;those forests and those minerals in the ground&mdash;which we possess. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I am referring to the minister's extraordinary press release last week, in which she inveigled the men of Australia to get plans so they could go supermarket shopping with their families. It was a most insulting press release to the men of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister was rightly condemned on talkback radio right across Australia. I heard a full day of talkback radio in Adelaide in which the minister was condemned by men and women who rang in and said that they had seen this story and that they could not believe that a minister in the Commonwealth government would stoop so low and instruct the men of Australia to get plans so they could go supermarket shopping. They thought, as they said on the radio, that she had much more important things to do than to tell families how they should conduct their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also incredibly out of touch. It failed to recognise the fact that families have changed dramatically in the last 10 years or so in the way in which they do organise their affairs. As the men said that rang in on talkback radio, they do help their families, wives and partners in shopping. It was such a ludicrously out-of-touch sentiment that she was expressing. It appeared to be the sort of worst excesses of ultrafeminism in condemning and insulting men in the way it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the minister's answer that struck me was the statement that her government does not interfere in the lives of Australian families. I am pleased that she indicated in her press release that the government was not going down the path of the Austrians, who apparently either have or will legislation to dictate that men shall shop a set number of hours with their wives. This, of course, is utterly ludicrous and I am glad the government will not go down that path, although it would not surprise us given some of the things this government does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement that the government does not interfere in the lives of Australian families cannot be left unchallenged because it is patently wrong. This government does interfere and does influence Australian families quite significantly in its tax and benefit policies. It does it to a degree that I think many Australians do not recognise. Clearly, the government itself does not recognise the extent to which it is influencing choices in what it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax system itself is based on taxing individuals, yet most of us live in households. Most of us live in families of one kind or another, yet the tax system does not recognise that at all. The effect of taxing individuals is that a single income family pays much more tax than a two income family receiving the same income. It works out that a family earning $40,000 a year pays something like $3,000 or $4,000 more when that income is earned by one person, compared with the family in which that same amount of income is earned by two people. The difference in the taxation effect is quite dramatic. In terms of the tax policy of the government, you are penalised if you make the choice to be a single income family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discrimination against single income families and the interference by the government extends also to a subject I have raised before: the child-care cash rebate and what is now called the parenting allowance. Through its policies the government is interfering in the choices families make. It does penalise a family if one parent, normally the mother, sacrifices an income to care for her children at home. She and her family will be penalised because the parenting allowance has a very strict income test on it and is paid at half the rate of the child-care cash rebate, which has no income test on it whatsoever. You are rewarded by this government if both parents work full time and place their children in child care, and you are penalised if one parent sacrifices an income to stay at home and care for the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is interference in the lives of Australian families and that interference is going to be extended in relation to the matter we are about to debate; that is, the limit of 12 hours a week for long day care where that child care is not work related. That is discrimination. That is interference in the lives of Australian families. The minister's rhetoric on this subject is absolutely empty and belies the fact that this government's tax and benefit policies do interfere in the lives of Australian families.</PARA>

Senator Hill's question clearly went to the issue of how good Australian families would feel when the economic reality in Australia is that three quarters of a million people are without a job and when we have one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the OECD, uncertainty in relation to interest rates, some of the highest real interest rates in the world, an enormous current account debt&mdash;I am informed that Australia is 49th out of 51 nations, including non-OECD nations, in terms of overseas debt&mdash;and job losses which are occurring now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point I wanted to put on the public record which tends to be overlooked by government spokespersons and by the media and economic commentators is Australia's international competitiveness, if you want to use that term&mdash;a comparison of our real interest rates. Australians during the last Keating recession, the last bust under Mr Keating's boom-bust economic management, did get used to hearing about interest rates of 17, 18 and 19 per cent and even higher rates for some small businesses on short-term credit facilities. Of course, when we see interest rates of 10, 11 and 12 per cent which are occurring today, we think that we are getting off quite lightly. But we can only compare apples with apples if we look at real interest rates, and that is interest rates that have been deflated by the inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had always thought that, with Australia's lower inflation as we have it at the moment, interest rates were probably very high in comparison to what they had been. Indeed, my further research shows me that Australia suffers the highest real prime bank interest rates in the world at the moment. We exchange that position with a couple of OECD nations month by month, but in 1995 we have actually averaged either the No. 1 ranking for prime real bank interest rates, or certainly been in the top three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the historic international comparison, we find that in 1976 Australia was ranked about 10th in prime bank real interest rates. That is about the middle of the world lead table for interest rates. In 1981 we maintained that average sort of ranking&mdash;about 10th in the OECD. In 1986, after three years of the Hawke-Keating Labor government, Australia had moved to having a real prime bank interest rate of about 9.9 per cent&mdash;into third spot. By 1991, after another five years with Mr Keating&mdash;now Prime Minister but then the Treasurer&mdash;we had moved up to a real prime bank interest rate of 12.8 per cent. We had moved to what we call in Grand Prix racing the pole position. We had taken the No. 1 slot in real interest rates in comparison to other OECD nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look again in 1995, our real prime bank interest rate is 7.3 per cent; again we have taken over the No. 1 ranking. Furthermore, Australia's prime interest rates are roughly 36 per cent higher than the average in the OECD. So we do have very high interest rates and even if there was a cut of one half of one per cent or one per cent, Australia would still have amongst the highest real interest rates in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons why Australians and Australian families in particular have been unable to feel the  benefits of all the enormous wealth that we have in this country. The government has built up a debt and that debt means that we have to pay higher interest rates, so when we go to create jobs, it costs more to expand businesses; when we go to buy a home, we have to pay nearly twice the average home mortgage rates in the OECD. Everything we do costs more because we are paying for the bad economic management of Mr Keating as Treasurer and as Prime Minister. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was extraordinary to listen to Senator Evans's response today taking credit for the natural wealth of Australia&mdash;of course, without any standard of comparison to what it was like before this government came into power and started destroying that natural wealth. The fact is that they inherited a naturally rich Australia. Despite that, their almost 13 years of government has meant that the standard of living in Australia relative to other countries with far less natural wealth has been deteriorating as this government has misused that natural wealth. According to the World Bank, Australia is naturally the richest country in the world. That should have provided us with the basis, the rock on which a booming and dynamic Australian economy would have brought increased riches and an increased standard of living to Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, that has not happened. It is extraordinary that Senator Evans should come in here saying, `Isn't it wonderful that we have this great innate natural wealth', and then try to take the credit for it when the facts are that under this government not even this high level of natural wealth can insulate Australians from the consequences of an incompetent government. That is what has happened over these 12 1/2 to 13 years of Labor administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is despite the fact that we are naturally rich that we have had the recession we had to have and that we have had a million unemployed&mdash;that is, the million obvious unemployed, apart from the other million or so hidden unemployed. It is despite that natural wealth that so many Australians are struggling to pay off their homes, that there are still three-quarters of a million officially out of work, that young Australians have such a relatively low prospect of getting a job quickly, that we have a 25 per cent youth unemployment rate and that there are so many people&mdash;particularly in some of the dormitory suburbs, if you want to call them that, of the major metropolitan areas&mdash;including young couples who find that they owe more on their home than their home is now worth, because of a combination of factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is despite this huge `wealth' that the government boasts about that we are going broke every year. Every month we have this massive balance of payments deficit that someone has to pay. It is all right for the government to say, `This is borrowing on private account.' The fact is that, as we go further and further into debt every year, there is a massive interest bill that the nation has to pay, and it is government policies that bring about this massive foreign debt, because there is a lack of domestic saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nonsense for the government to say, `Don't blame us; it is private sector borrowing.' That is absolute self-evident nonsense. What the World Bank figures are showing is that 12 1/2 years of Labor government has meant that our massive advantages&mdash;which should mean Australia's standard of living should be constantly increasing and that we should be a happier and wealthier country&mdash;have been steadily wasted. Our standards have deteriorated, with many people out of work and prospects for many poor. It is a scandal that, with this massive natural wealth, we should have been so decimated and our prospects so destroyed by this incompetent Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Report contains one recommendation only, that <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">legislation be introduced as soon as practicable to provide for the establishment of an office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority to investigate complaints against the Authority or its staff, </EMPHASIS>which essentially replicates a recommendation contained in the 1991 Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations of that Report were addressed by the Government through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Crime Authority' Amendment Bill (No 2) 1992</EMPHASIS> (the Bill). In particular, the Bill provided for the establishment of an Office of Inspector-General to deal with complaints against the NCA and amended the Act to clarify the access of the Parliamentary Joint Committee to sensitive NCA information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Bill was debated in Parliament the provisions relating to complaints were unanimously supported but a number of amendments to the access provisions were made in the Senate which were unacceptable both to the Government and to the State and Territory Ministers who are the Members of the Inter-Governmental Committee of the National Crime Authority. The amended Bill was therefore laid aside by the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, on 16 December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government remains committed to ensuring the accountability of the National Crime Authority through an appropriate complaints regime. Circumstances have changed since the PJC reports of 1991 and 1994. The NCA now employs no non-police investigators. All NCA investigative staff are either members of the AFP or are seconded from State or Territory police services, and are thus subject to the formal complaints regimes of their respective jurisdictions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of these changes, and in order to accommodate concern expressed by the States that any complaints regime introduced for the NCA should mesh effectively with State arrangements, the Government has decided to give a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission to inquire into the most appropriate means of handling complaints against the NCA, to be undertaken in conjunction with its current inquiry into the complaints and disciplinary system of the Australian Federal Police. The ALRC would be required to report by 30 June 1996. This position is supported by the Inter-Governmental Committee.</PARA>

<PARA>It is disappointing that the Chinese government has not responded favourably to world opinion and with consideration to neighbouring countries who are affected by the tests at Lop Nor in the Xinjiang Province of north-western China. Criticism has not just come from Australia but from a variety of nations in the vicinity of the tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has said that bilateral ties, including billions of dollars worth of economic assistance, might be harmed by the tests. South Korea has said that the tests are `regrettable', while other nuclear powers are restraining testing. Kyrgystan shares its borders with China and has concerns about its own ecology; it has seen the tests as a step backwards for peace and security in the region. Kazakhstan has called on China to join the testing embargo, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All nuclear tests anywhere should be stopped. The Lop Nor site is too close. The Kazakhstani people will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA>And its people certainly have suffered enough with over 500 tests of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The head of the Nevada-Semipalatinsk-Lop Nor anti-nuclear movement in Almaty, Kazakhstan, has said that he is very upset about the tests because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As everybody knows, the ground above Lop Nor is not very stable, the tests are made close to the surface and the wind is carrying the radioactive fallout to Kazakhstan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uighur community leaders in Kazakhstan have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the people are suffering from radiation-linked diseases and damage to the gene pool which means that the next generation will not be healthy. They use us as Guinea pigs for their tests. The tests never take place where the Chinese live, only where Uighurs live&mdash;it is racist.</PARA>
<PARA>East Turkestan leaders have said that the tests are an offence against humanity. So we are not the only ones showing concern here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For its stance on testing, the Chinese government must receive the same amount of international pressure as has been applied to the French government. It is disappointing that it has returned to old arguments that Australia and other countries are just interfering and trying to break up its nation. China needs to realise that, if it keeps testing, this will exacerbate independent struggles and ethno-political and economic tensions in its outlying autonomous regions. Testing will have the opposite effect and will encourage people to want to break free, as China is sacrificing their health, welfare and ecology for objectives that are illegal and unnecessary. If anyone doubts that logic, people in Tahiti felt exactly the same&mdash;that it was the testing that was exacerbating the call for self-determination in that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's statements against China have been couched in our disappointment at China's testing just after the conclusion of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. China would be cynical about Australia's pro-active role during NPT negotiations where we helped nuclear weapons states to protect their existing arsenals from any definite timetable for disarmament. Although China is a nuclear weapons state, it is a nuclear weapons state trying to keep up with other nuclear weapons states. Disarmament is therefore crucial for Britain, the CIS and the US who have far more nuclear weapons than China could dream about, before we destroy any reason for China to test any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to stop the nuclear arms race, then we must not stop at the physical testing of weapons but at the computer simulation testing of weapons that the US and the CIS employ which provide a reason for other nations to test in the first place. We must not allow the hypocrisy of a situation where the bigger powers conduct tests which are invisible to the rest of the world and yet visibly protest about the nuclear tests of other countries. All nuclear testing must stop to halt the nuclear arms race. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Ozone Protection Act 1989 and repeal the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Act 1989 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Act 1989. The Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Bill 1995 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Bill 1995 will replace the repealed Licence Fee Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Bills reflect Australia's evolving obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and exemplify this Government's long standing commitment to the recovery of the earth's stratospheric ozone layer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill will establish the legislative structure to enable Australia to implement effective controls on methyl bromide, hydrobromofluorocarbons (`HBFCs') and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (`HCFCs') similar to those controls under the current legislation on chlorofluorocarbons (`CFCs') and other ozone depleting substances. The Bill also repeals the current licence and quota system from 31 December 1995, consistent with Australia's obligations under the Montreal Protocol, to stop the further import or manufacture of CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform or carbon tetrachloride. The Bill provides for exemptions, where these are permitted under the Protocol, for essential uses such as medical dose inhalers and for used ozone depleting substances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989 when the Ozone Protection Act was originally passed, even the most optimistic forecasters could not have predicted that ozone benign technologies would be developed by industry and accepted by consumers in less than six years. Australia has effectively played its part in the global strategy to save the ozone layer. By the end of 1995 Australia will have phased-out the manufacture and importation of CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. This is an enormous achievement and the Government recognises the efforts made by all levels of our society to date. Industry has proved that concerted, cohesive strategies do bear fruit and can succeed in reversing what was described in 1989 as one of the world's worst catastrophes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But more needs to be done if we are to consolidate all the achievements to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993 and 1994 the Antarctic ozone `holes' were the biggest and deepest on record. We can expect that ozone destruction will get worse before the reversing effects of the Montreal Protocol measures are evident in the stratosphere. The rate of ozone destruction is expected to peak during the next few years, then start to slow down during the early part of the 21st century. Based on these forecasts, and provided international action proceeds as planned, the ozone layer will be at its most damaged around the turn of the century and should recover in about fifty years' time. The trends are already good. Atmospheric growth rates in the troposphere of several major ozone-depleting substances have slowed. This is evidence that the Montreal Protocol is having its intended effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the scientific background against which recent amendments to the Montreal Protocol and the proposed amendments to the Ozone Protection Act must be viewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have been prepared in consultation with relevant Commonwealth departments, State and Territory environmental agencies, conservation and community organisations and affected industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April 1995 the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) endorsed policies for HCFC controls. It was recognised that HCFCs would need to be used in Australia as temporary substitutes for CFCs&mdash;but only temporarily because these substances still are ozone depleting. As part of Australia's strategy for their phase-out, two different levels of controls were proposed by ANZECC. For controls on HCFC supply and production, Commonwealth legislation was recommended and for controls on emission and use, State and Territory legislation was recommended. ANZECC's decisions followed two years of discussion between representatives of the Commonwealth, State/Territory Governments, industry and conservation groups on the extent and types of controls necessary to meet Australia's needs. These polices followed on from the ANZECC's endorsement of the Revised Strategy for Ozone Protection which did not include HCFC or methyl bromide recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills before the Senate are based on the policies agreed to by ANZECC, industry and conservation groups. State Governments have already, or are now, preparing complementary emission controls on HCFCs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provides that all current licences for CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride cease on 31 December 1995;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">establishes a new system of essential use and used substances licences for ongoing uses allowed under the Montreal Protocol;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">introduces a new system of controlled substances licences for HCFCs and methyl bromide;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">bans HBFC exportation and manufacture; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">establishes a Trust Fund into which all fees will be paid to support the administration of the Act and management programs for HCFCs and methyl bromide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current Ozone Protection Act 1989, CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride have each been subject to a licensing system and a progressive phase-out. The phase-out of these substances will be complete at the end of this year. This will have been achieved through unprecedented co-operative efforts by governments, industry and the Australian community and has set a benchmark for collaboration on environmental protection in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments provide that the import, export and manufacture of CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride will be banned as of 1 January 1996, except in the limited circumstances allowed by the Montreal Protocol. These exceptions are accommodated under the Bill by two types of licences: an essential uses licence and a used substances licence. I will deal with each in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the substances being phased out, the Montreal Protocol allows for continued use in a limited number of "essential use" applications. Australian "essential uses" have been approved for the years 1996 and 1997 by the Parties to the Protocol. This will allow for the continued import of CFCs for metered dose inhalers and substances for laboratory and analytical uses in those years. If CFCs are still required beyond 1997, a further application for `essential uses' will be made to the Protocol Parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Essential use licences" for these uses will be issued subject to strict conditions and in accordance with the Protocol guidelines and definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to the proposed system of used substances licences, the Montreal Protocol distinguishes between new substances and recovered or recycled substances. Ozone depleting substances which have been recycled or reprocessed to the required purity specifications, or which are destined to be so recycled or reprocessed within Australia or overseas, may be imported or exported under a used substances licence. This type of licence will also be required for the import or export of waste ozone depleting substances. The used substances licence system will replace the current restricted licence system under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The licences will be subject to strict conditions specifying the permitted activity and the circumstances under which it may be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the phase out of CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride by the end of 1995, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol agreed in November 1992 to phase out the use of HBFCs by the end of 1995, to phase out HCFCs by the year 2030, and to freeze methyl bromide consumption from January 1995 at 1991 levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To enable Australia to ratify the 1992 Protocol amendments, the Ozone Protection (HCFC, HBFC and Methyl Bromide) Regulations 1993 were made. Under this Bill the provisions of these regulations are to be incorporated into the Ozone Protection Act. The regulations enabled controls on methyl bromide imports to commence under the Act from 1 January 1995 when controls on methyl bromide came into force internationally. In the case of HCFCs and HBFCs, controls will come into force internationally on 1 January 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultation with industry and other interest groups concerning the extent and types of controls necessary to meet Australia's obligations revealed a preference by industry for a more flexible approach, involving a degree of self-regulation, compared with the system which was used for CFC phase-out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has co-operated with Commonwealth and State environment agencies to set an upper limit for production and importation in Australia which ensures that Australian use of these substances is constrained, while the interim status of HCFCs as substitutes for CFC equipment is recognised. Industry is confident that manufacturing and importation activity will stay under this limit, but accepts the need for government involvement if activity exceeds this limit. In contrast with the previous CFC licence and quota scheme, licences will be easier to obtain and transfer, and if government involvement through a quota system is necessary, quotas will be based on licensees' market activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulation of HCFCs and methyl bromide will be achieved under the Amendment Bill by a licensing scheme. A controlled substances licence will be necessary for the importation, export and manufacture of those substances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HCFCs are used mainly for refrigeration and air conditioning. They are also used for foam manufacture and as aerosol propellants. In 1992, the Montreal Protocol Parties agreed to phase-out HCFCs totally by 2030, with a 90% phase-out being completed by 2015. In 1993, Australia used 2,573 tonnes of HCFCs. Australia has one manufacturer and approximately 11 importers of HCFCs. The manufacturer has already announced that it intends to close the plant in Sydney by the end of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Amendment Bill establishes an initial limit on total consumption of HCFCs, called the Australian cap, which will gradually reduce until the current Protocol phase-out in 2030 is achieved. The cap will be made up of an industry limit and a reserve limit. For 1996, these limits will be 250 ozone depleting potential tonnes and 50 ozone depleting potential tonnes respectively. The industry limit is that quantity agreed by industry as being necessary to meet the needs of existing HCFC uses and CFC uses that may convert to HCFC. The reserve limit is an amount set aside for exceptional circumstances to ensure that essential type uses are not jeopardised by an Australian cap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licences will be issued for a two year period and will be more easily obtained than under the current CFC scheme which was based on prior activity. The new scheme will control the total amount of HCFCs imported or manufactured but will not limit the number of licensees. The CFC scheme, in comparison, limited the total number of licensees but did not limit the amount of CFCs that could be imported or manufactured to less than the Protocol limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will allow companies wishing to participate in the HCFC market for only a short period the flexibility to enter and leave the market but will not increase the total amount of HCFCs being used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providing industry collectively imports or manufactures less than 90% of the industry limit on HCFCs, industry will self-regulate and the quota system will not be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If in any year this 90% limit is exceeded, quotas will be allocated to individual importers and manufacturers. If the 90% limit is exceeded the Minister will be required to give notice in the Gazette advising that from the next HCFC period the HCFC quota system will commence. The notice will establish the base year for quota allocation and the total amount to be issued through the quota system, based on the industry limit as stated for that year in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the quota system is triggered, it will be illegal to import or manufacture HCFCs without a licence and a quota. Quotas to individual licensees will be based on the market share of each licensee in the last full calendar year preceding the commencement of the quota period. Licences will be transferable on approval of the Minister and quotas will be fully transferable. If a company obtains a licence after the commencement of the first HCFC quota period, it will be up to that company to acquire a quota from existing licensees. Companies in this situation will be advised of this condition prior to any licence being issued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry believes that the proposed Australian cap is realistic and adequately caters for increased use of HCFCs as temporary substitutes for CFCs from 1996 to 1999. To avoid the early retirement of expensive, commercial air conditioning equipment with a long economic life, a small quantity of HCFC quota will, under the current schedule, remain available until 2030.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of the scheme is proposed for the year 2000 to ensure that the scheme continues to meet Australia's requirements and Australia's obligations under the Montreal Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Methyl bromide is a fumigant used to kill pests and diseases in soil, stored grain and quarantined primary products. In 1992, the Montreal Protocol Parties agreed to restrict the import and manufacture of methyl bromide to 1991 levels as from 1 January 1995. Under the Protocol decision, quarantine and pre-shipment uses are exempted from the freeze.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia imported 1200 tonnes in 1994 and, as required by the Protocol, has limited its imports for 1995 to 688 tonnes for non-quarantine and pre-shipment purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no single substance which can substitute for methyl bromide, given the wide range of applications for which it is used, but several alternatives are available for certain specific applications. At present no practical substitutes are known for a number of important applications, such as quarantine, however research into alternatives is proceeding in Australia and internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many agricultural sectors will be affected by methyl bromide restrictions. The main impacts are likely to occur in sectors which are required, under plant health standards, to have disease and pest free stock, particularly the strawberry growing industry and flowering bulb industry. These industry sectors and others which may be affected are involved in consultations with the Environment Protection Agency, with a view to each industry sector developing its own strategy for dealing with the management of methyl bromide and any further international controls. The co-ordination of research, information and training will all be important elements of Australia's overall strategy for reducing methyl bromide use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other countries which have already controlled or phased out methyl bromide, such as the Netherlands, have found suitable substitutes. The United States has announced a domestic ban on methyl bromide from the year 2001. Those countries that have already phased out claim to have found substitutes without major economic impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory scheme proposed for methyl bromide has been kept as straightforward as possible because only two companies expect to continue importing. Under the Amendment Bill, methyl bromide importation will be continued under a controlled substances licence. A condition of the licence will set a maximum quantity of methyl bromide that can be imported annually by the licence holder. Each importer will be allocated a share of the total amount of methyl bromide that Australia is allowed in a particular year under the Montreal Protocol, based on their market activity. The licences will be issued every two years. The scheme allows for the Montreal Protocol targets to be reduced if possible, although this is not proposed at this early stage of methyl bromide controls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Amendment Bill will repeal the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Act 1989 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Act 1989 which will be replaced by the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Imports) Act 1995 and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees-Manufacture) Act 1995. The new Acts will allow for non-refundable fees to be levied on the activity of licensees, based on the quantity and ozone depletion potential of HCFCs imported or manufactured and the amount of methyl bromide imported or manufactured. In addition, an application fee will be required. The fees will recover the costs of administering the licensing systems and fund HCFC and methyl bromide management and industry awareness programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme is intended to be cost-neutral to the Commonwealth Government. Industry has agreed, based on its experience with the CFC licensing scheme, that the Commonwealth Government through the Environment Protection Agency, has an important information role in assisting owners of equipment with their decision to convert to alternative technologies, equipment and processes which have no impact on stratospheric ozone. Industry has also agreed that the awareness programs should be based on the principle that those companies deriving a benefit from the import or manufacture and use of ozone depleting substances should pay for the cost of programs designed to assist users of those substances to change their practices. Industry representatives have been consulted on the level of fees and have not objected to the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with those principles, industry supports the creation of a Trust Fund to ensure that revenue collected from licensees at the time of peak activity, between the year 1996 and the year 2000, can be spread and utilised at the times of lower activity between the years 2000 and 2030 when the need for information programs will be most critical if Australia is to minimise the economic impact of the final stages of the phase-out program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initial activity fee levels for HCFCs will be set at $2000 per ozone depleting tonne and for methyl bromide at $900 per tonne. The bases for calculation of fees will be set out in regulations. Importers have no objections to the level of fees. There will also be a two-yearly administration fee for each licence, which will be set at $10,000 per licence period until the year 2000. Fees for essential uses licences will be set at $2,000 per annum and for used substances licences at $10,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been at the forefront of international efforts to mitigate damage already done to the ozone layer and to minimise future damage. The Commonwealth Government's approach in building an effective partnership with industry to phase-out ozone depleting substances is proving to be an innovative and successful way of meeting the need for ozone protection while containing the effects on the wider community. These Bills will ensure that Australia continues not only to meet its international obligations under the Montreal Protocol, but to lead by example in protecting the ozone layer through innovative and effective regulation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains a number of proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 which arise from the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report entitled "The 1993 Federal Election" which was tabled on 16 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the matters dealt with in the Committee's report which are of a minor or technical nature, and which require legislative amendment, have been taken up in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995 which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 1 February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This second bill will allow greater flexibility in the method used by the Australian Electoral Commission for the conduct of Electoral Roll Reviews. Rather than being required to undertake a full roll review every 2 years, the Commission may now conduct reviews targeted to areas of high population movement or lower than expected enrolment, instead of or as well as full national roll reviews. The Commission will also be able to conduct reviews using other methods in addition to the traditional visits to habitations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow electors who are going overseas to apply to register as eligible overseas electors within three months of their expected departure or within one year after the actual date of departure. At present electors who are going overseas must apply within one month of expected departure and, if they do not, they cannot apply once they have departed. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will extend the time for the close of rolls from 6.00pm until 8.00pm on the day the rolls close for an election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that the death or withdrawal of a candidate, who is one of a number bulk nominated, will not invalidate the nomination of the remaining bulk nominated candidates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow for the dispatch of postal ballot materials to all registered General Postal Voters immediately after the declaration of nominations. Currently, only those General Postal Voters who are registered as unable to sign their name are sent postal ballot material directly. All other General Postal Voters are sent an application for a postal vote, with postal ballot materials sent only on the return of the application. This process can disenfranchise some people who rely on the post to exercise their right to vote, especially those in remote areas where the postal services are infrequent and sometimes unreliable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will make workable the administration of the existing provisions regarding prisoner disqualification. The existing provisions provide for disqualification based on the maximum sentence which could have been imposed. To be properly administered, this would require a detailed study of the indications from the sentencing judge of the indictments and the sentencing judge's decision. The cost of such procedures would be prohibitive. The bill provides that the disqualification be based on the actual sentence imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally the bill will also make a number of amendments of a minor technical nature.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second part of the amendment relates to the amount of money that can be expended for a contract before ministerial approval is required.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be clearly unworkable, in the light of that regular outlay, for $1,000 to be the limit before ministerial approval is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In consultation with the community and others, we decided on the limit of $100,000 for a number of reasons. We can point to the examples of the Tiwi-Bathurst, Melville Island, Central and Northern land councils, which also have that same limit. There is a consistency there.

They do not represent the government funding that is represented when ATSIC allocates $100,000, so there is a distinction.

That seems to me to be a classic example of a Henry VIII clause, which would allow the regulations to, in effect, change the law as it stood.

In other words, if they were not permitted or required by the act, you could still make them as long as they were necessary or convenient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is simply a way of avoiding the power that is given in the first instance. The act usually says you can make by-laws with respect to X, or it may go on and say you cannot make by-laws with respect to X. What you are saying, Senator Chamarette, is that you can ignore that as long as it is necessary or convenient. You can get into endless arguments about what might be regarded by the mover as necessary or convenient; it is a highly subjective test. In any event, the logic of it is to say that it is not necessary for it to be required or permitted or indeed that it might be specifically not permitted, and yet you could still go ahead and enact those by-laws under (b).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Senator Chamarette will obtain some formal advice as to the effect of that provision. All I am saying is that, as I read it, it is not only far too wide but would inevitably be struck down, and for that reason we would not support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would again like to clarify the objection Senator Alston has raised. He is quite at liberty not to support the amendment, but it is outrageous that he is implying that there is some kind of logic to his argument that relates to subclause (1) and the fact that paragraphs (a) and (b) have a conjunctive `or' between them. These are the words of standard regulation making power in acts and they do not, without more words, constitute a Henry VIII clause. That would need an express power to override the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two paragraphs relate to creating by-laws in relation to functions under the act. The first one relates to those that might be required or permitted by the act and they are obviously by-laws that will need to be carried out or additional by-laws which may be necessary or convenient to be made for carrying out or giving effect to functions under the act. So it is clearly in subjection to the act and I think it is very deceptive of Senator Alston to read out only half the sentence that relates to paragraph (b) of our amendment. I can only repeat that there is no way in which his criticism has a logic which is able to be applied to the phrasing of the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am open to having another person who can explain the situation in a different way challenge me and say that the clause might need an `and/or' or something like that added, but I fail to see that it is necessary in any form. I think the way (b) is phrased makes it quite clear that by-law making cannot go beyond the powers of the act. For it to do so would require an express power to be written in somewhere, and nowhere is that written in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very sorry that the legitimate standard regulations that apply for by-law making in relation to all acts are not being supported by the opposition and that the opposition is supporting a discriminatory basis whereby this council will be limited in the degree of its autonomy and its capacity to make its own by-laws under the act. That is where the Greens stand. I will not prolong these discussions, although it might be interesting to hear from the minister. In my view, Senator Faulkner shares the erroneous view that this in some way goes beyond the act. I have a clear understanding from my advice that that is not correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Alston. With respect, I must say to Senator Chamarette that I do not think she understands the ramifications of the proposed amendment. Let me try to elucidate the situation. What you have in paragraph (a) is a limitation on the scope of by-laws. It says that you can make by-laws only if they are `required or permitted', so there has to be a specific delegation within the act to enable a by-law to be made under paragraph (a). The problem is that paragraph (b) circumvents paragraph (a), because you could create a by-law under paragraph (b) which does not deal with a delegation specifically inserted in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a hypothetical situation. Suppose one had an act which contained this provision and dealt with local government by-laws. The act said that the local government could by law declare any area a construction site and, by declaring that area a construction site, people would be obliged to meet certain workplace health and safety obligations. That would fit into paragraph (a). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But suppose the council decided that what it was going to do was not only designate a certain area a construction site but, by another by-law which was not specifically provided for under the act, also regulate the speed at which traffic passed on the streets surrounding the construction site. Because there is no specific delegation of that authority, the making of that by-law could not fall under paragraph (a). However, the council in question could say that it could make such a by-law because it was necessary or convenient for the carrying out of the construction that was to be embarked upon. That is the problem. Paragraph (b) adds a whole range of additional powers which are not specifically delegated in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn very briefly to the other argument that Senator Chamarette put up&mdash;that these by-laws were disallowable instruments. Senator Colston, as the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, you would understand that sometimes the making of a regulation can be detrimental and the disallowance of a regulation can be even more detrimental, because it precludes for a period of six months the making of a further delegated instrument which deals with the same subject matter which has been disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Chamarette really misses the point if she says that these are disallowable instruments. I agree with Senator Alston&mdash;the scope which is permitted by paragraph (b) is too broad. That is why the coalition is not supporting the amendment, not because we have a discrimination towards Aborigines. It is just simply good law making. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995. The coalition will be supporting this bill. The aim of the bill is to improve import and export regulatory controls, ensuring the long-term conservation of native wildlife consistent with Australia's international obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, CITES, and the International Convention on Biological Diversity. Australia ratified CITES in 1976 and ratified the convention on biological diversity in 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, which is the principal act, was enacted in 1982 under the Fraser government. On 6 May 1982, the then Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, the Hon. Ian Wilson, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to strengthen arrangements for the protection of Australia's animals and plants, and world wildlife generally by improving the effectiveness of our import and export controls.</PARA>
<PARA>The act establishes a scheme to regulate trade in endangered species consistent with Australia's international obligations, including CITES. The act also provides the foundation for controlling trade in Australian native flora and fauna. On 12 March 1986, the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, the Hon. Barry Cohen, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act is a major element of the Government's nature conservation program. It received the support of all parties when introduced into Parliament in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>The object of the act is to ensure that trade in fauna and flora is conducted in a sustainable manner. According to the Australian Nature Conservation Agency annual report in 1993-94, which I think summarised it quite well, the act plays an important role in preventing the establishment of pests and diseases which could adversely affect the Australian environment, by regulating the import of most species of live animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CITES recognises that international cooperation is essential for the protection of certain species of wild fauna and flora against over-exploitation through international trade. CITES aims to regulate the international trade in endangered species to ensure the survival of such species. It imposes different obligations on state parties, depending on the danger of extinction faced by the particular species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent conference of the parties on CITES was held in Florida in November last year. This was the ninth meeting of the conference. One hundred and nineteen parties attended the conference, which I understand is a record number, and presumably Senator Faulkner was there on behalf of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important steps were taken at the conference to preserve some endangered species. For example, the main tiger bone producing and consuming countries put forward a resolution at the conference urging parties to adopt or strengthen legislation regulating the killing of tigers. The Republic of Korea has prohibited the sale of tiger bone from November 1994. It is estimated that there are less than 5,000 tigers worldwide. The conference will meet next in Zimbabwe in June 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention on biological diversity defines biological diversity as `the variability among living organisms from all sources, including inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems'. Section 78 of the act requires appropriate consultation with state and territory ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Faulkner mentioned in his second reading address, the proposed amendments to the bill have been developed after extensive consultations with state and territory governments, industry and non-government organisations and are in accord with the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. This is not to say that every aspect of the bill has universal support and acceptance, but I think it is true to say that the broad thrust of the bill is, in fact, widely supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues which various states, industry and conservation groups have raised with me, and I will be exploring these matters in the committee stage of the bill. For example, one issue which has received a high degree of interest in recent weeks has been the national registration scheme for exotic birds. In its discussion paper on the registration of exotic birds, published in June 1994, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency noted that the `illegal importation of exotic birds has increased dramatically over the past few years' and that existing legislative controls are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill aims to safeguard the Australian environment from the illegal introduction of exotic birds by introducing a national registration system for certain species. The explanatory memorandum states that `the registration scheme will make it extremely difficult to trade in illegally imported birds'. The bill provides that after the transitional period&mdash;30 days after the section commences&mdash;a person cannot possess a classified exotic bird unless that person holds a registration certificate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be an exotic birds committee, which will provide an advisory group to the minister to examine the ongoing effectiveness of the registration scheme. The committee will comprise government, conservation, and private and professional aviculture representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some concerns relating to the registration of exotic birds. There have been a variety of views put to me, and I dare say to the minister as well, by groups such as the Associated Birdkeepers and Traders and the Avicultural Federation of Australia. I shall be raising with the minister some of the concerns which have been expressed to me, and I hope that these concerns can be effectively addressed in his responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some aviculturists have alleged a lack of consultation about their concerns. Other groups such as the Queensland Birdbreeders Alliance and Associated Birdkeepers and Traders have strongly supported the amendment and argued that there has been consultation. </PARA>

I understand that the minister has a copy of Mr Woolcock's letter and will undoubtedly respond to these concerns during the debate this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the issues raised by aviculturalists include the composition of the Exotic Birds Committee; what species are to be included and the rationale for their inclusion; how the scheme will work with existing state laws and regulations; how the scheme is to be funded; who will bear the costs; what ongoing input will be available to bird keepers of Australia; and what review mechanisms will enable species to be removed from the scheme. Among other things, the federation has expressed concerns over what they see as excessive penalties for possessing an unregistered bird and have asked for an assurance that no bird keeper will be required to pay more than one registration fee for the birds they keep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the attitudes of state governments, one state has criticised what it sees as the artificial imposition of a five-year time limit on management program approvals and automatic suspension of approval of management programs with unrestricted approval time limits.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the section referring to the zoological export of live animals, it has been pointed out that proposed paragraph 13(1)(e) proposes that animals must come from a species that can be readily bred in captivity. Some have asked how one can assess whether an animal can be readily bred in captivity and/or is difficult to breed in captivity. The states have also expressed concerns about the costs to states and territories of being expected to assist in implementing schemes such as the exotic bird registration scheme and the assistance which may be available by state and territory bodies in enforcing the act. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a suggestion that the legislation is largely powerless to prevent the introduction of potential weeds into Australia and it does not require one to consider the possible environmental impact of the export of Australian plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister would certainly be aware of the paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Of tiger treatments and rhino remedies</EMPHASIS>. Traffic Oceania has pointed out that poaching for illegal trade is driving the tiger and rhinoceros to the brink of extinction, parts of these species being used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine. Traffic Oceania believes that the Wildlife Protection Act and the amendment bill do not adequately cover manufactured items such as the traditional Chinese medicines or ivory inlaid items which contain CITES-listed species as an ingredient or a component. While in practice such items have been treated as falling under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, the definition is said by Traffic Oceania to require clarification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the belief that the bill needs strengthening to properly implement the provisions of CITES resolution 9.6 on trade in readily recognisable parts and derivatives. This provision agrees that CITES provisions should:</PARA>

<PARA>As I said, the bill enjoys fairly widespread support. There have been expressions of concern from some of the states and territories about particular provisions. Groups have followed this bill closely&mdash;groups like the Worldwide Fund for Nature, which has carried out intensive research, and their associate organisations such as Traffic Oceania, which would like to see the bill go further in a number of areas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In second reading contributions it is usual to range fairly widely to set a bill in context. While it is usually my colleague Senator Woodley who deals with biblical references, I would like to start with Noah and the Ark. As somebody who is now a non-believer, I find it very difficult to think of 30 million species being taken on board two by two and then let go after the flood to re-populate the world. Nonetheless, I think there is a symbolism in that which is important to pick up in respect of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill: whether we like it or not, we have achieved a situation, because of our dominance of the natural environment, where we are now the caretakers of life on earth between now and whenever the end of life on earth will occur&mdash;perhaps 500 million years hence, when the sun cools, explodes or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rejecting the conventional Christian view that there was ever any intention that homo sapiens would become the dominant and ultimate pinnacle of an evolutionary process, again paradoxically we have nonetheless assumed that situation. We have an awful&mdash;I use that word in its original biblical sense&mdash;responsibility with respect to caring for wildlife on earth at present. We now have, for instance, a population on earth of almost six billion people, and the population is expected to double before it asymptotes to some sort of plateau. This is assuming that we can find the resources&mdash;the food, the water and everything else to sustain such a large population. I observe that 40 per cent&mdash;this figure comes from the World Bank, an interesting body that has come out with some remarkable statements in recent times&mdash;of all the photosynthetic energy which falls on earth at present directly or indirectly flows through human civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders what that means in terms of wildlife and natural ecosystem protection if the population is going to double and at the same time governments around the world are, like our government, bent on economic growth. Economic growth means that the percentage of natural resources consumed, including that proportion of photosynthetic activity, will increase. Indeed, the prospect looks extremely dim that within a doubling of population there will be any wildlife left on earth at all. That raises again the issue of whether humans can survive such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what governments tell us&mdash;this government no less than any others&mdash;the economic system is not the dominant system into which the environment has to be fitted as an afterthought, if and when it can be fitted in. The environmental system, the natural environment, is the basis upon which the economy and every other aspect of human life rests. If we ignore that simple fact, we certainly do it at our peril. We do it at even greater peril to our children and their descendants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simon Crean and the Treasurer quite recently talked about sustainable economic growth rates of three per cent. How often have I pointed out that sustainable economic growth is an oxymoron. It is quite impossible to sustain economic growth because by its very nature it means increasing consumption of natural resources. It means an increase in the dollar value&mdash;in constant dollars, having taken out the inflation factor, one year compared with the previous year&mdash;at the cost of further consumption of the natural environment, the destruction of wilderness and loss of biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth is simply not sustainable. Economic growth must plateau, as must human population, if there is to be any natural environment remaining for our children not just to enjoy but on which to form the substrate upon which their lives, their economies, their systems of survival will ultimately depend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Setting this bill in its broadest context, it is a step in the right direction but it is only one small step and does not go nearly far enough. I am not criticising the bill or, in this respect the minister; I am criticising the whole context in which this government is operating. The context is wrong. The context indicates that this is simply not going far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view that I have put is often described as an alternative view. Again, that is quite wrong. It is not an alternative view. The conventional wisdom is not wisdom at all; it is stupidity. The idea that we can continue to grow and continue to consume the natural environment at three per cent per year compound interest is stupid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view that I am putting, that sooner or later, and preferably sooner, we must move towards a steady state&mdash;one in which there is no economic growth, one in which we set limits to the demands we make on the environment&mdash;that system is the only system which is sustainable in the long term. That is the biological view. That is the view that recognises that the world is finite; it is not infinite. The economic rationalists who believe in the growth paradigm are wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic rationalists are like the robber of old, Procrustes, who, in order to make his victims fit onto a bed, cut them if they were too big or stretched them if they were too small. Economic rationalists behave in that same procrustean manner, trying to take the real world, stretch and hack it until it fits with the physical reality. I stress that the bill needs to be seen in that context. It is okay as far as it goes but it is a drop in the bucket compared with what needs to be done, particularly in restructuring the framework of economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the government nor the opposition see the primacy of environmental considerations. To both of them, the environment is something you fit around those economic considerations, which are seen by them as being far more important. But the environment must come first and, as I said, we ignore it at our peril. The environment must be seen as the base upon which the economy rests. If we steadily erode the environment, if we steadily lose our biodiversity, if we steadily lose the ecology, which is what this bill is about, then there will be no economy at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Bank has come out with this rather remarkable statement that Australia is the richest country in the world. There has been a bit of discussion about this, most of which indicates that the context in which I am developing this argument today is not well understood on either side of this chamber. The World Bank is talking about real wealth, the natural wealth and the human wealth, on which the economic cash flow&mdash;the GDP or GNP&mdash;is based by extracting wealth from that natural capital account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, there have been several studies which have attempted to modify these economic indices. They indicate that in the case of America and the United Kingdom there has been a decline in this modified gross domestic product since the mid-1970s. That indicates yet again that even on its own terms the economic system to which so much obeisance and credibility is given is not delivering even the material goods to the human population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that sort of background, given the attitude of the government, and given the attitude of the opposition&mdash;which, as we heard from Senator Kemp, pretends to be the next government&mdash;we can hold very little confidence in the survival of the natural environment with its biodiversity and rich life supporting structures. I believe these supporting structures will continue to be eroded, either under this government or under the opposition if it should form a government, and that this government will achieve no more than a slowing down in the rate of its deterioration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could cynically remark that the success of these measures might be counterproductive because one of the peculiar things we notice about human beings is what is known as the boiling frog syndrome: if changes occur sufficiently slowly, people seem to be able to adapt to them. As we all know, a frog put into cold water which is slowly heated up will simply sit there and die, whereas a frog dropped into hot water will jump out very quickly. I expect that human populations are a bit like that. The legislation which is moved to slow down these changes and deterioration is likely to cause people to adapt and not react as severely as if environmental damage were occurring more quickly. So even bills like this may be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A cursory glance through schedule 1 of the principal act shows the scale of the problem with which we are dealing. Many hundreds of species are listed. Some, such as the thylacine and the lesser bilby, are already extinct, yet we continue to regulate their import and export. We are already a long way down the road to quite massive extinctions. In my own state of South Australia we have the worst record of mammal extinction anywhere in the world. This is not being prevented or slowed by this legislation or any other serious attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another two problems associated with this legislation are matters which I have drawn particular attention to many times in the past. Both relate to the development of this bill in accord with intergovernmental agreement&mdash;which Senator Kemp has already mentioned. He has mentioned it in rather praising terms; I would mention it in rather pejorative terms. The protection of the Australian environment and its biodiversity is indeed a national issue; it requires a national approach. When you involve intergovernmental agreements and those sorts of mechanisms, you necessarily involve a piecemeal approach and often finish up with the lowest common denominator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states are not all equally interested in and concerned about the environment, and the seeking of consensus is not the best way to arrive at national policy on the protection of species and their ecologies. I believe that we should be pursuing a national agenda and that we should be doing it through this parliament, not through those intergovernmental agreements. I would agree with Senator Kemp: discussion, with the feeding in of information, is an appropriate action to take. But ultimately, the responsibility for the protection of Australia's environment rests with this national parliament; it does not rest with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often in the past discussion that has gone on before a bill is prepared and presented to the parliament means that parliament is merely asked to rubber stamp what has already been agreed to&mdash;and this bypasses the democratic process. I think the opposition is in agreement with this. The issue comes up again in relation to international agreements in which the national government might have agreed internationally with other governments. When we are asked to pass legislation here and one attempts to move amendments to those international agreements, one is told, `No, you can't do that because we have agreed with 25 other countries that this is the format.' In that way the proper democratic process is bypassed. Again, for those reasons, I think one needs to be rather suspicious of this process of intergovernmental agreement as a way of achieving a national protective medium for protection of the Australian environment and its biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, I understand that the minister is prepared to entertain some amendments; therefore, what I have just outlined is clearly not the case. However, I just make that as a general proposition in relation to the many pieces of legislation of this type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that in the past we have made enormous mistakes regarding the importation of exotic species into Australia. Many people have remarked on it. In fact, an expression that you hear almost every day is: Australia would have been a marvellous country if it had not imported so many pests. Wherever you look, you see pests of all sorts; every genus would have pest species that have been imported. Some of these may well have been genuine accidents. I suppose nobody wanted to import the Portuguese millipede which is, and for a number of years has been, infesting the Adelaide Hills quite severely. But many of these species have been deliberately brought in, with the very best of intention and with access to the very best information available at the time of import. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How good and how comprehensive is the information available to us today? I venture to suggest that, while it is better than it was when the rabbit was introduced, it is still not perfect; in fact, it is a long way from being perfect. The report on the pilchard deaths&mdash;and I notice that Senator Collins is in the chamber&mdash;illustrates it is not possible to rule out the possibility that the disease which was responsible for that massive fish kill was or was not caused by an introduced virus or protozoan. Not wanting to argue whether it was or was not, the fact that we do not know and cannot be certain indicates the lack of underlying knowledge which we need to sensibly control the import and export of species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quantum</EMPHASIS> program just last week dealt with the quite serious and massive deaths of frogs in the Queensland rainforests and suggested that this may, again, have been due to the importation of water along with exotic aquarium fish. Again, I am not arguing whether or not that is or was the cause; that is irrelevant. But it seems that, again, we cannot be certain whether or not that is true because of the paucity of information to properly regulate the movement of animals and plants from one part of the world to another. The precautionary principle should lead us to not doing something, if there is a chance that the results of doing that thing could be irreversible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's second reading speech indicates that the government is concerned at the possibility of the establishment of self-sustaining populations of exotic birds in the Australian wild. Surely the same concern should be expressed over self-sustaining populations of any exotic species, whether with species coming into Australia from outside or with Australian species being sent elsewhere. I throw that in because there has been a great deal of discussion recently, particularly on the part of the opposition, about getting an economic advantage from exporting Australian species to other countries. If we have poor knowledge about the effects of species coming into this country, one can imagine how little knowledge there may be in many other countries about the exporting of Australian species elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have amendments to this legislation, some of which I understand the government is prepared to accept. We support the bill but believe that much more needs to be done before our wildlife is managed on a long-term sustainable basis. The faults in this bill are not so much to be found in what the bill does not address but rather in the attitude of the government which gives such low priority to the protection of the Australian environment together with the multitude ecologies which it contains. In short, lip service only is being paid to the notion of sustainability but little is being done&mdash;and nothing, if it impacts on the principal economic objectives of the government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal and illegal export of Australian native animals has been the target of a great deal of speculation and rumour, fact and fiction, in recent years. When I was involved in the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare the issue of bird smuggling was raised several times and, while anecdotal evidence was abundant, there was little that the authorities seemed able to do to stem the trade. The amendments that this bill will put in place will improve regulatory controls on the import and export of animals and birds, with a view to ensuring long-term conservation of our native wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Coulter&mdash;in saying basically that he is the font of all knowledge as far as environmental matters are concerned&mdash;does himself a fair bit of injustice. I know that on this side of the chamber we have a great deal of interest in environmental issues and have had for as long as I have been in the parliament, which has been for something like the last 10 or 11 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, in essence, says that commercial harvests of native Australian and certain overseas wildlife must be conducted on a sustainable basis, with no detriment to the long-term survival of any species. It also ensures that commercial exports can only take place when there is appropriate state and territory legislation in place and, to that end, it is the responsibility of the states and the territories to ensure sustainability of commercialisation. The bill also strengthens the enforcement powers of inspectors appointed under the act&mdash;and that can only be welcomed. The illegal trafficking of Australian wildlife is inhumane and we need to be mindful of the range of rare and endangered species that have the potential to be wiped out by mindless, greedy acts of illegal smuggling. The national registration system for certain species of exotic birds is also significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also limits the number of native household pet animals that can be exported. I am not sure whether my office was the one to have been targeted to receive more mail on this bill than any other office, but suffice it to say I have received many letters from various elements within the agricultural industry&mdash;an industry which I understand attracts some 1.5 million people to it. The number of people who keep animals never ceases to amaze me. As patron of the RSPCA in New South Wales, I must say that just about every household seems to have a pet of some shape, shadow or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Avicultural Protection Association is quite opposed to the legislation, claiming that the industry has been denied access to information about the amendments. They argue that the legislation is an intrusion into their hobbies and their businesses and that it will have the opposite effect in that the smuggling of birds will return to the pre-1989 levels, which I understand were higher than that which is currently believed to exist. I have similar letters from people who describe themselves as private bird keepers and who see this legislation as unnecessary bureaucratic intervention in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other groups, such as the Associated Bird Keepers and Traders, offer support for the legislation, suggesting that vested interest groups have an interest in delaying the process. They argue that all aviculturalists have had the opportunity to voice their opinions and to have delegates attend meetings. I understand that one of the reasons for the delaying tactics in New South Wales is to ensure that the New South Wales legislation precedes the federal legislation so that some birds can be declared legal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kemp said, this legislation is a step in the right direction. He also said that it is an issue that is very complex. But I am concerned we have a piece of legislation that has not had the full exposure to industry that it might have had. I recall a similar diversity of views some years ago among deer breeders, some of whom supported legislation affecting their industry and others who opposed it. The legislation was taken through the Senate rural and regional affairs committee and, at the end of the day, it was simply a case of the affected parties being given an opportunity to air their views and to work through a compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with this legislation is that it will not have the desired outcomes it is designed to have and that it will become merely another revenue process for government. As I have said before, I have no hard evidence of the smuggling of wildlife in or out of Australia; but, like so many other Australians, I am appalled at the efforts people go to in smuggling wildlife and the usually fatal results it has for the wildlife involved. I remain concerned about what other goods may be involved in the import and export trade. Having said that, I think the committee stage of this bill will actually weed out some of the concerns and some of the worries some people may have and hopefully come up with the right result in the final analysis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering a bill to amend the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. This is an act which attempts to enshrine the findings of the 1973 report of the Australian House of Representatives select committee on wildlife conservation, itself a response to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES, and the IUCN red data book of the world's endangered species. As such, it seeks to protect Australian and foreign endangered native animals and plants, including those threatened with extinction, by regulating their import and export. In this intention, the act is widely regarded as effective and necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process of its amendment provides us with an opportunity of fixing up the loopholes that currently exist to make it do justice to the enormous amount of natural wonder that Australia possesses in the form of its bio-diversity and native species. With the aim of improving the act, there are some problems that the Greens see associated with the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill. I would be grateful if the minister cleared up some of these ambiguous or grey areas or aspects that currently exist about the intentions of his act over these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great concern to us that in the amendment to this act the Commonwealth is apparently seeking to allow an import of the skins of panthera pardus, a spotted cat that is listed as vulnerable with CITES. It is commonly known as the leopard and it is allowed into Australia under quota. Where the main reason for the importation of the skins into Australia would be as a result of hunting expeditions into Africa by Australians, this amendment seems to be blatantly condoning a gratuitous and unnecessary practice which is helping to push species such as the leopard into the endangered zone and eventually into extinction. As responsible members of the international community with such ecological wealth as we possess in Australia, we cannot condone actions that would strip other countries of theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the components of the definition of plant and animal specimens in both the current act and the amendments do not include certain important types of animal or plant products. A concern of the Worldwide Fund for Nature was the lack of controls on the export of dead marine fish from Australia. Species such as the eastern gemfish, orange roughy or deep sea perch and southern bluefin tuna are under threat from such lack of controls. The act needs to be amended to deal with this inadequacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as the act stands at present, few controls exist over the import and export of seeds. Thirdly, although agricultural weeds are covered by the Commonwealth Quarantine Act, there is no provision in respect of the contamination of the Australian environment by environmental weeds from other countries. This has been a significant problem in the forests and woodlands of Australia due to lax legislative control and it is an issue that needs to be remedied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the proposed Democrat amendments dealing with a prohibition on the sale of endangered species imported in contravention of the act and of species otherwise illegally imported under the act, this is another important change to the act that is necessary to ensure that its stated aims are fulfilled. However, this amendment needs to take into account the relevant affected communities&mdash;for example, the Chinese medical community, which draws many of its medical resources from animals native to foreign countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we last dealt with this matter we were talking about whether or not it is possible to create monopoly conditions through shape trade marks. There were concerns about not knowing what the courts would find in such instances. I have noticed quite a few advertisements on billboards which show just the shape of a cool drink bottle. There seems to be some expectation by industry that this will come about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same issue applies to other sensory signs&mdash;sound, colour and smell. Already, we see industries like the perfume industry, the wine industry and so on lining up to try to register the smell of their products as trade marks. People who make the decisions on registration say they would not do so and explain why. I believe them, but I know that once sensory trade marks are allowed in law, companies will try it on again and again.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am less sure about the integrity and understanding of courts. I think if guidelines are created, companies which seek to register smell as trade marks will work out ways to meet the guidelines which will satisfy the courts, if not the people who register the trade marks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another implication here. Although the regulators might have always found against such improper use of sensory labels and shape and might express their intention to continue to do so, we must remember that this legislation includes another change&mdash;the reversal of the onus of proof. We have seen it on a number of occasions in recent times. After the passage of this bill the Trade Marks Registry will not have to prove why an application should not be accepted. While this might be reasonable with regard to labels, are they really ready to meet all the claims in relation to sensory signs? Yet this is exactly what they will have to do when this raft of claims on sound, scent, shape and so on comes through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, I am proposing a simple amendment which will effectively delete reference to shape, smell, sound and colour, except as part of labels, an aspect of packaging, from the definition of `sign'. This is all that is required to eliminate reference to such things. If a case for registering any of these things is overwhelming, it can still be done. I understand that it has been done for pink batts and a very few other goods. Our amendment would not deprive manufacturers of the ability to identify their products in a way that would allow consumers to differentiate. That is the purpose of trade marks. Our amendment might compromise the marketing plans of big transnationals or interfere with those who wish to break new ground in legal challenges. Somehow, that does not bother me. I commend our amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment, as I mentioned, has the purpose of clarifying that we will not have a situation where a shape or, perhaps in the future, a smell, may be legally defined as a sign. We would then have what I believe to be an unwarranted intrusion by corporations into those areas, as I do not think they have the right to own shapes. Someone could perhaps patent a spherical shape. Just think about it. You might think it is clear that the shape of a coca-cola bottle, for instance&mdash;even if it is plastic, no longer glass&mdash;might well warrant patenting. But what if someone patents a triangle, a circle or a square? Where do you stop? How do you then stop the conclusion of patenting smells of various sorts? I think we should be wary of this. One way of doing that is to clarify it in the way I have suggested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the amendment moved by Senator Margetts. The committee will appreciate that what we are doing here is very much in line with consultations we have had in the lead-up to this bill. As has been indicated already, the new definition of what may constitute a trade mark contained in the bill allows the registration of sounds, smells and the three-dimensional shape of goods as trade marks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position taken by the government is that in response to the developing marketing needs of business and in line with international developments in trade mark law, we have recognised that a wider range of matter, including aural and olfactory signs and the three-dimensional shape of an article, is being, or could in the future be, used to identify goods and services. The definition of what may constitute a trade mark has therefore been expressly widened to include sounds, smells and shapes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this definition makes it possible for such signs to be registered as trade marks, it does not guarantee that such registration will occur. The fact that it does not guarantee it gives some safeguard as to the sorts of concerns raised by the Greens and the Democrats. All trade marks, for instance, for which registration is sought must meet the criteria for registrability set out in the bill. These include that the trade mark must be able to be graphically represented and the trade mark must be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods and services from those of other traders. So to be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods or services, the trade mark must be something which is not an essential feature of the goods or services and is not something that other traders will use in the ordinary description of their goods or services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are safeguards in place to protect against excesses. The structure of the bill is such that to be eligible one must meet certain prerequisites. As a consequence, we think the definition proposed by the Greens is one that is too limiting in terms of the future prospects for development of industry and is out of line with contemporary and developing international trade mark practice and protection. </PARA>

It is a form of fiscal tightening which is masquerading under a professed desire to regulate the way in which child care is planned.

Child-care assistance is a scheme designed to help low and middle income earners.

In reality, this restriction is not based on any strategy or philosophy about the future development of child care in Australia and it has placed further uncertainty on families who are continually forced to endure the broken promises of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The government claims that there is a shortage of child-care places for working parents. The minister says that by restricting the amount of child care available for non-working parents this undersupply will be adjusted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1994, the Auditor-General stated in the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mind the children</EMPHASIS> that access to non-work related care is not equitable as it depends on the availability of places rather than on the demand for care. There are approximately 90,000 below school age children who require child care for work related reasons and who are not receiving it. With unmet demand of this magnitude, those who are already at the bottom the child-care priority list should not be subjected to further discrimination. Why should lower income families be penalised for the ineffectual planning of child care by the government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Auditor-General's report and the Law Reform Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child care for kids</EMPHASIS> examined the issue of affordability of care. Both found there were inequities in funding through child-care assistance and that, due to the occurrence of gap fees, the child-care assistance program had not succeeded in its goal of ensuring that a family's child-care costs are directly related to its ability to pay for care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General found that the child-care assistance subsidy was `generous for wage and salary earners but gap fees restrict affordability for low and middle income earners'. This gives the lie to the government's pre-1993 election claim that occasional child care was an essential service for mothers, and, indeed, fathers, and that child-care payments should not be considered a welfare payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating said, in February 1993, that `after years of lobbying by women, the Labor Party has decided to recognise child care as a basic right'. He described it as an Australian right, alongside education and health. In September 1995, we see that, in the scramble to make up for Mr Keating's extravagance on other matters, so-called rights are obviously only rights as long as it took to finish the last election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is also extremely concerned that the disallowable instruments and the guidelines have not been presented, at least to the coalition parties. I understand that other parties were presented with draft copies of these and it would have been courteous of the government, I suggest, to have circulated those guidelines amongst all the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide for an independent administrative mechanism to assess families' work related status for the purpose of gaining priority of access to a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. Amendments to the Child Care Act 1972 in this bill allow a family's entitlement to child-care assistance to be assessed not only on the basis of economic need but also on the basis of the work related status of the family or other special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of concern that people must be registered with the CES before being considered to be looking for work. The range of work available and the ways in which jobs are obtained result in people not using the CES, or in people considering it to be not particularly helpful. Indeed, in another inquiry with which I have been involved&mdash;it is being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training&mdash;the CES has been found to provide something like three per cent of those job vacancies which employers advertise. There are many other avenues which people use today in their efforts to find work. The requirement for registration with the CES in order to be considered for work related care will often be an unfair imposition to place on parents. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence given at the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into this legislation suggested that many parents and carers were reluctant to advise of the problems they might have with the children and that, in any event, it was more effective for a service to identify problems in advance of serious abuse occurring. As the coalition members stated in their dissenting report, we believe this suggests that the department is not fully aware of the needs of different sectors of the community and the difficulty many parents and care givers may experience in identifying and solving problems when they do not have access to some respite care or to the assistance provided by a service such as family day care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detail of these special circumstances and the intention of the ministerial discretion with relation to these has not been announced. There is no justification for the extension of the minister's powers in this way. The provision of the bill dealing with disclosure and verification of family composition and work related status imposes yet another layer of bureaucracy on the provision of child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs held an inquiry into the legislation in the last sitting period. It was completely unacceptable that we had to report on legislation without being fully apprised of the detail with regard to the enabling legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of this bill has been notable for its complete lack of transparency and openness. It was announced as a budget measure without consultation with parents or the industry. In fact, every industry group that made representation to the Senate committee advised that it had no inkling prior to budget night of the fact that this was to be brought in as a budget measure. Parliament has been kept completely in the dark about the detail of the disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders why the government is so keen to avoid any discussion of this bill. I point out that to many people it represents total hypocrisy on the part of the government. They have spoken about child care as a right and about their commitment to parents and care givers in Australia and their ability to access affordable child care for their children. Suddenly, without any prior announcement, one door is totally slammed in the face of parents and care givers. It is for that moral reason alone that the government should be held to account on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, being kept in the dark could have something to do with the overwhelming objections to this legislation by the community. I have personally presented over 15,000 signatures in petitions demanding that this bill be dropped. The unanimous opposition to this proposed legislation has been quite remarkable. In the Senate inquiry, the minister herself admitted that her office received approximately 4,000 letters on the subject. She was unable to say how many were in favour of the legislation. I suspect that the five letters she read out for the benefit of the community affairs committee were the only letters in favour of it. She was forced to acknowledge that the vast majority of the letters were not supportive of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the community have very good reason to be opposed to the provisions in this bill. In the past the government has said that access to child care is a right and that families on lower incomes are entitled to child-care assistance to help them exercise that right. This government is now proposing to take that right away from families where one parent is not in paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lower income families who are not able to purchase additional child-care hours at full cost will be most hard hit by this decision. The gap between rich and poor will be widened. This is only one of many ways in which this gap has been widened in the last 12 months alone by this uncaring government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is most galling in this budget decision is the government's absolute hypocrisy. The same budget which several months ago announced changes to the payment of child care also produced the agenda for families. The agenda for families document proclaimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government's priority has always been to those families most in need.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our assistance to families must be equitable, so that families benefit according to need and so that extra support is available for families with special needs . . . based in consultations with families and an understanding of their needs and choices.</PARA>
<PARA>Every action by the government in relation to this legislation has been in total contradiction of the policy announced in the agenda for families and they should be brought to book on that account. How is it possible that the same government which produced this rhetoric could be so hypocritical as to introduce a bill that is inequitable and that discriminates against low income families who are most in need, where one parent is not in the work force? The government had no previous consultation with families or carers and only addressed the issues raised by concerned groups once the coalition initiated an inquiry into the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These decisions will place great pressure on child-care centres where demand for work related care is already being met, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales where the expansion of the private sector has been most rapid. The Australian Federation of Child Care Associations has stated that the decision will cost thousands of jobs in child-care centres, will force many centres to close and will disadvantage tens of thousands of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even today I had a letter from a child-care centre owner in Queensland whose demand for work related care is being met, and a large proportion of her clients are those people who need occasional care. She is now to say to them, `You can only have fee relief for 12 hours.' The restriction is totally commercially unrealistic: many centres will find it impractical to utilise the additional hours in the day as care is not generally provided on a sessional basis in private child care. It is not usual to book in for two or three hours. Centres now book half a day or a whole day and you cannot sell gaps, such as between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. or between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. That is a totally unrealistic appreciation of the way in which child-care centres work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many thousands of families will be adversely affected by this decision and families who were previously utilising non-work related care will find it financially impossible to continue to do so. They will pull out of places, which in turn means that centres will be forced to increase the fees across the board in order to maintain their financial viability. The Queensland Professional Child Care Centres Association has calculated that the change could result in an average increase in child-care fees of $18 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of the investigation by EPAC into child-care provision in Australia reflects his obvious lack of confidence in Senator Crowley, the Minister for Family Services. Last week I visited Tasmania, where the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training is having an inquiry into early childhood education in Australia. One of the Tasmanian government spokespeople said that we are now having something like three or four inquiries into child care. How does the industry feel with continual inquiries and continual re-assessment of the position being done by government? Centres cannot operate with a degree of commercial confidence and this recent piece of legislation that we are considering today in the Senate simply reinforces that insecurity and total change of the landscape every couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for an investigation is evident. This government's child care program is failing to meet the needs of parents and child-care providers&mdash;a fact the coalition has been aware of for some time. The bill reflects the government's failure to understand what child care provision is all about. It reflects the government's failure to be concerned about the needs of low income earners and their children and is yet another example of the government's child care disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill, which is before us this evening, is really quite a simple piece of legislation. It is simple because it is enabling in nature. It merely sets a framework; the details are actually to be found in the ministerial guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child-care assistance was formerly known as fee relief. It is a means tested payment assessed through the Department of Social Security, targeted to low and middle income families to make child care more affordable. The payment is made directly to child-care services, which must reduce the fees payable by parents accordingly. Currently the average weekly fee for 50 hours of care is about $140. That is about $28 a day. Child-care assistance has a ceiling of $112.50 for that 50 hours of care, or a rate of about $2.25 an hour. Parents effectively pay an income related fee up to that $112.50. Part of the gap between that amount and the weekly fee may then be recouped by working parents through the child-care cash rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this bill itself is quite simple. However, in saying that, I wish to point out that it disguises the devil, which is found in the detail. It is the child-care guidelines that actually set the limit on eligibility for assistance for care which is deemed to be non-work related. That assistance, the government is now telling us, should be limited to 12 hours a week. I will go into that at length in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do so, I would like to stress that the Democrats' aim has always been to be constructive and consultative and not obstructive. We have been consistent supporters of the government in the area of child care. That includes support&mdash;I must say crucial support&mdash;for the quite controversial accreditation scheme which was introduced last year. That was in the face of considerable criticism at the time which now, I am very pleased to say, has almost totally disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That history of cooperation, I believe, does give us credibility when we say to the government, `You've got it wrong this time. This legislation is nowhere near in a form that we can let through this place.' We base that belief on our research, on our record of consultation with the industry, indeed on all that has been said so far in the various submissions to the community affairs committee. That objection is coming from right across the industry&mdash;from the community based sector as well as the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, all up, several thousand pieces of correspondence. It runs to boxes. It shows I believe, that the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) has totally underestimated the amount of concern that is being created out there in the community. It is our view, that we may eventually get to the point of saying that we do need to look at non-work related care versus work related care. But what seems to have been overlooked is that there already is a prioritisation&mdash;categories 1, 2, 3 and 4&mdash;and if that is being implemented properly, a lot of what the government tells us is happening simply does not ring true. The government cannot present a credible argument about children from non-work related families taking the places of those from work related families when those criteria guidelines, those access criteria, are already there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibility of some limitation on non-related care is just one piece of the puzzle. We do not know as yet what shape that piece of the puzzle should take or where it should go in the overall jigsaw. We need to have some certainty about what the picture finally looks like. To do that, we must make sure we have an integrated series of services at federal, state and local level, taking into account the needs of families and of course the needs of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I would argue now, having listened through the committee hearings, that we do not even have all the pieces. I was amazed to find that there was a piece that we did not even know existed. There has been some planning done in New South Wales that sets out where services are and where they are needed. It is years out of date. </PARA>

We cannot find that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have attempted to survey most child-care services across the country. What is coming back is a very complicated maze&mdash;a mixture of overservicing and dire need not being met, particularly in the Melbourne area. It seems that even getting work related care is almost impossible in some inner areas of Melbourne. Surely, we need to find all the pieces of the puzzle before we try to make the decisions we are trying to make now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What developments are currently under way? Firstly, COAG is discussing this now. It has been looking at the matter of roles and responsibilities in the sector since February 1994&mdash;for 19 months&mdash;and is due to release a discussion paper in the next couple of weeks. So why are we dealing with this legislation today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Australian Early Childhood Association is about to release a planning model for children's services. This has attracted the interest of all service provider organisations&mdash;from the community based child-care sector, to preschools and groups from the private side of the industry. In fact, so interested are these groups that they have given us a unanimous commitment to cooperate in developing this model to a stage where it can be adopted by government. If government will not go ahead and continue the facilitation of that process and show some interest, the Democrats are happy to step in and continue the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, a couple of weeks ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the establishment of a task force on the future of child-care provision in Australia by EPAC. We believe the establishment of that task force, along with the two other processes I have just mentioned, confirms that the government acknowledges it has to do more work in this area. It understands that there are gaps and bits of the puzzle missing. So I ask again: why are we going to proceed with this now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our recommendation is that we complete the second reading of the bill today but then delay the process until at least late November to allow further consultations and discussions. That is still our position after further negotiations and  contact with the industry. I must stress that we prefer that position to the prospect of actually defeating the bill because, if we simply vote against the second reading, we will send the message to government that it can safely put this back in the too-hard basket and leave it until the election when it makes some sort of family policy announcement. Other than that policy, the government would think it does not need to make any substantial changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But changes are needed. The community sectors are asking for changes, because they are seeing the private sector setting up on their doorstep in an area where it is not needed. The private sector also, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, is asking for changes, because it has established viable services only to see another centre allowed to operate across the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government is asking for changes, because at the moment they do not believe they have the planning powers necessary to say, `No, you do not need to establish another child-care service'&mdash;in whatever place that may be&mdash;`We already have four more services on our books for that locality, so we are going to refuse you planning permission.' The chances are that what will happen is that the people wanting to operate another child-care service will simply go through an appeals process. The councils are often worried about getting themselves into a legal nightmare. We have to have planning in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has been mentioned time and time again through the committee process is the potential for harm to children who have come to rely on these services. This is a genuine concern and it has come from many groups, including those dealing with children who have specific needs, such as the southern child-care support program in South Australia. Many of these concerns, I am sure, can be met through proper consultations on the development of guidelines, but that still, as yet, has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care industry says what it needs is an integrated planning model. The Democrats certainly agree. The industry says it has made this clear to government over a number of years. It was again made clear at the committee hearing. Developing such a model is in line with the recommendations of the Auditor-General's report No. 42 titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mind the children</EMPHASIS>. The first finding and the first recommendation of that report were both about Commonwealth-state relations; in particular, the need for cooperative planning. That is what the COAG process is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit report suggests limits may be part of this process but not a solution in isolation. It emphasises that `recommendations need to be implemented in a controlled manner over a reasonable adjustment period so as not to undermine the viability of the child care industry as it now stands.' As Senator Troeth has already explained, we are likely to see businesses driven to the wall through this legislation. Surely sending small businesses into bankruptcy is not a good planning mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also emphasises that options be provided for respite care so that only a minimal amount of this care is provided by formal, high cost, long day care services. It appears that that process has not, at least not yet, been undertaken in a planned or detailed manner. We are not saying we need rigid planning&mdash;I think this was one of the things bothering the department&mdash;but we do need some overall look at where the needs are, particularly for specific sorts of services such as for babies and whether that need is being met at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is also supported by a quote from the November 1994 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> magazine, which looked in depth at child care. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When attempting to find the best child care arrangement, (parents) have to deal with a mixed bag of service providers in an industry that is at best fragmented and at worst an absolute mess . . . There are very few referral or placement agencies in Australia that can assist parents to find an appropriate service, and the small number of government information services are so poorly publicised that few parents know they exist.</PARA>
<PARA>Not a great recommendation for the government I would suggest. I would hope that as a result of this debate and the lead-up to it that we will at least enter a dialogue with the government on planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area we should tackle up front is the question of cost. At the committee hearing we were told that the majority of the savings from the government's proposal would come from a `slowing of the rate of growth' of the industry. We believe that slowing, particularly in parts of Queensland, northern New South Wales and I suspect some areas in Sydney from our survey, will occur under the approach the Democrats are recommending&mdash;that is, that we simply leave this legislation on the table and we send a very clear message to anyone planning a child care service that they need to do their homework. They need to check at local government level, at state government level and at the federal department level as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At local government level they cannot necessarily rely on the statistics already collected. It may be a process of surveying the community in which they plan to set up a child care service to ascertain needs at the grassroots level because the planning processes, even at state government level, are probably not going to give them an accurate look at what is there at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those services that are already at risk&mdash;and I would put in that category any of those services significantly relying at the moment on category four children&mdash;what we are trying to do now is change the rules in the middle of the game. Child care operators have entered in good faith into an industry they believe can offer them a reasonable standard of living. Yet, if those who are accurately following the priority guidelines, acting correctly, doing everything they know they should be doing have a significant number of category four children, the passage of this legislation will place them at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that what is happening is an integration of children's services&mdash;that is, child care, kindergarten, preschool, et cetera. All of the planning for that is happening by default and not by specific design. State governments have to be actively involved in this process because I suspect some of them are deliberately hiding some of those bits of the puzzle in their pockets at the moment, trying to slip them quietly off into the federal government's pockets disguised as a tendering out process of children's services. A very clear message has to be sent to state governments that they have to be actively involved in this planning process and not in a process of simply cost shifting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still on cost, there are competing claims about the amount of savings available to the government from this 12-hour approach. We have seen Access Economic figures which indicate that the end result of a 12-hour limit in isolation could actually cost the government money, not save it in the longer term. Questions raised in works such as the Brotherhood of St Lawrence's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Unequal lives</EMPHASIS> and the Institute of Family Studies' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today's child care, tomorrow's children</EMPHASIS> about the possible costs of not providing services for children from low income, non-working families have gone unanswered. I would be most interested in the minister's comments here today. I hope she will cover some of those issues as to who exactly are those children, what their needs are and what will happen to them if this arbitrary 12-hour limit is put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to make a couple of other points. One is about double dipping. We believe the practice of charging twice for a place&mdash;that is, if a booked person does not attend but is still charged and then there are overlapping children and the charge is still rendered&mdash;should be outlawed. This will probably involve a cap on child-care assistance available to centres, but we wish to discuss and negotiate with government on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is to confirm our support for some measures the government is undertaking. One is the simplified application process, which will involve a slight downward adjustment of the income and assets test for child-care assistance. Another is a $2 increase in the minimum fee for child-care assistance and the rebate which is worth apparently about $83 million over four years. Another is an alteration to how changes in income will be dealt with, including entitlement for an immediate review if the family's income falls. I must stress here, Minister, that those changes could be introduced without any need for this legislation. They are separate. They can come in in regulations and be dealt with there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we will not support is an alignment downward of holiday fees for holiday periods to 50 per cent, which is the inadequate figure that exists at the moment for family day care services. We will also not support reductions in meal and transport allowances for family day care providers, especially in light of the Law Reform Commission's report and the Ramis report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish where I started. The Democrats' aim is and has always been to be constructive, not obstructive. We have been consistent supporters of the government in the general area of child care. Our history of cooperation I believe gives us credibility when we have to say to government, `Hang on. You have not got it right this time.' We do not want the bill to be killed off because in our view the question of work status related limits for care and the whole issue of planning must be dealt with now and not shelved or put into the too hard basket. We also want real consultation and consideration to be given to planning and to involve the industry. As I said earlier, we have offered to facilitate that process for service providers from both the community based and private sectors of the industry. </PARA>

Apparently there was only $65 million spent on child care by the Commonwealth government as long ago as 1982-83. Expenditure in the current financial year is going to be $1,100 million, and it is forecast to rise to $1,500 million in 1998-99. That is an almost exponential growth in expenditure in this area. In fact, it has increased by 18 per cent per annum in real terms between 1983-84 and 1993-94, and it is still increasing at a somewhat similar rate. So we really have had a very massive increase in expenditure in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paradox is that part of that is, of course, a result of obviously increased demand for child care, and part of that increase in demand is a function of government economic policy. Increasingly, ordinary Australian families are saying to researchers that they need two incomes to maintain their standard of living, and to have two incomes they need child care. If you dispassionately look at the surveys of the attitudes of young working mothers, you find that very high proportions of them would prefer to be caring for their children, but they cannot afford to. They need child care and, therefore, we have this vicious circle, where the government is increasingly called upon to spend more and more money on child care. So it is appropriate that the government look at expenditure in this area and how to contain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Democrats have said and as my colleague Senator Troeth has said, this bill is not the way to go about addressing that problem. As Senator Lees says, there are clearly some doubts as to whether the $152 million savings forecast over the next four years will, in fact, be achieved. There must be real doubt about that, as there have been in other areas of government cost containment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem&mdash;certainly from my point of view&mdash;with this proposal is that it is simply further evidence of the government's active discrimination against single income families. That is what it really boils down to. We have complained long and loud about the government's discrimination, whether witting or unwitting, in terms of single income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made a particular point of complaining about the discrimination inherent in the operation of the child-care cash rebate and what is now called the parenting allowance. I do not need to repeat that, except to say that the rebate, as you know, has no income test whatsoever, while the parenting allowance has a very tight income test, although that has been relaxed a little. The rebate is still worth twice as much for a mother of two children in child care as the parenting allowance is worth for a mother of two. We have maintained that that is unacceptably unfair to mothers who sacrifice an income to care for their children. As a result of the government's policies in this area, there has been a nationwide protest movement against the policies of the government, against the discrimination, and I think it is going to cost the government dearly at the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said before, and we will say it again, that we sympathise with the government's objective of wanting to save money. There is a very clear way in which they could do that, and that would be to place an income test on the rebate. We argued that case when the rebate bill was before us. Your own former finance minister, Senator Peter Walsh, has argued the case, and many social commentators have argued the case, for some sort of income test on the rebate. The rebate itself is an example of runaway expenditure. It cost the taxpayer $90 million in 1994-95 to subsidise child care in this way, and it is going to cost a forecast $137 million in 1998-99. That is a 50 per cent increase in expenditure in this area in the next four years. Of course, it costs $15 million a year on top of that to administer the program through the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate needs to be seen in the context of what we believe is the discrimination that the government has been practising in relation to the child-care cash rebate on single income families. It is our view that this proposal will widen that discrimination. It widens it by limiting access to long day care to 12 hours a week for `non-work related child care'. We have had submissions from the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations, and I think they need to be listened to. As they say, this proposal is particularly going to hurt single income, low income and one income families. That is the tragedy of this proposal and why we have great reservations about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do believe that it, unfortunately, is typical of the adhockery of the government's approach to child care, and Senator Lees spoke eloquently on that subject. I think the core of the government's problem in this area is its mind-set. It seems to be stuck with that union based 19th century approach to what is work and what is not work, and it is designing all programs of assistance in this area around those arbitrary definitions of `work' and `non-work'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal is fundamentally based on that arbitrary division of labour, and it seems to us entirely inappropriate in the late 20th century. Whether it is true or not, it does appear that this policy is all about helping only two income families. That is what the effect of this is. If you are a two income family, you will not be affected by this. If you are a one income family, forget it, because you will be hurt by this proposal. It seems to us that the government is out of touch with the reality of the modern lives and aspirations of many families, and many women in those families, and that is why it is stuck in this ancient mind-set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many modern families, there is a lot of flexibility about the way their family arrangements are conducted and made. That is increasingly the case, and that particularly relates to young mothers in terms of their activities&mdash;whether they are doing paid work, unpaid work, study, volunteer work or whatever. I suppose, to take a personal example, my wife is the classic case. For the 10 years we have had young children, she has had a variety of activities, including casual paid work and volunteer work for my party, the preschool, the kindergarten, the school and other activities. So, in terms of what she does as a young woman in modern society, what is work and what is not work when you look at the enormous range of activities which she&mdash;and she is typical of all her friends&mdash;does? I think that is the fundamental problem with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is going to depend, at the end of the day, on bureaucrats determining what is work related child care and what is non-work related child care. That is the only way in which this bill can operate, and I think that is the fundamental problem with it and why it is unacceptable. It is based on a quite arbitrary and out-of-date idea about what is work and what is not work. I just do not think government assistance for child care in particular should be based on those sorts of arbitrary distinctions between what is work related and what is not work related. Child-care assistance should be based on need, financial need, and that is why we have talked about income tests in the past. To try to get a whole bureaucratic empire built around trying to decide what is work and what is not is hopeless and doomed from the start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill itself, in trying to go down this path, contradicts what the government itself says in the children's services program is the objective of child care. It says that it is to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force and the general community. So it would seem to us that what is being proposed here completely contradicts that stated objective of the government's program. The program objective is not to distinguish between `work related' and `non-work related', yet that is the fundamental premise of the bill we have before us. I think this bill is a case of the government unwittingly meddling in the choices that families seek to make about how they structure their lives and about their work, whether it is volunteer work or paid work, and about how the children are looked after. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister did say today, in answer to Senator Troeth's question, that the government does not interfere in those choices. Here we have a bill on this very day which does exactly that, and that is why I took note of the minister's answer today. The fact is that the government does&mdash;albeit often unwittingly&mdash;interfere in the choices made by families in its tax and benefit policies. I think that is unfortunate and one of the real problems with this bill. Those sorts of choices should be left to families to make, and they should not be penalised or rewarded one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does, in fact&mdash;whether it meant it or not&mdash;reward families where both parents are in the paid work force and the children are in child care. In a relative sense, it penalises families where the family makes a choice that one parent is going to stay out of the paid work force and care for the children, care for elderly relatives or do volunteer work in the community. They are going to be penalised. They are penalised through the tax system; they are penalised through the operation of the child-care cash rebate; and they are penalised through the operation of this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other grounds on which the bill is objectionable. They have been outlined by both Senator Lees and Senator Troeth. The Federation of Child Care Associations summarised them very well. They claim, and we have no basis on which to disagree, that the bill will cause the closure of some centres which are premised on there being a supply of children who are there for non-work related child-care reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, that will of course cause the loss of child-care workers' jobs. That could well have the consequence of increasing long day care fees and therefore the gap fee. As we and the federation have said, this will hurt non-working, single and low income families. I think Senator Lees put it very well. The problem is that this is changing the rules in the middle of the game. Those were Senator Lees's words. I think they are very proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private child-care centres are badly affected by this bill for that reason. They have made their investments, their planning and everything else on the basis of the rules as they stood about access to child care and access through the child-care assistance scheme. Now the rules are being changed in a way which will obviously affect them badly. It will affect them financially and affect the provision of care, which is what we understand the government is all about. Unfortunately, through this proposal the government is simply adding to the complexity, the unfairness, the adhockery and what we believe is the ideological rigidity of government policy in this area. Therefore, we oppose this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues have already very adequately outlined the purposes of the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill and the problems associated with it, and I will not cover that similar ground. One aspect I want to focus upon has already been described by Senator Minchin as an arbitrary and out-of-date distinction between work and non-work. That is the point that the Greens (WA) want to make in relation to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a strong ideological statement regarding the position and value of `non-working' parents and the construction of gender roles. The government's problem with the fee structures of child-care centres and/or double-dipping from the child-care industry is a separate issue, an industrial issue, and could be dealt with perhaps within the accreditation scheme. At home parents and their children should not be penalised for the failures and inefficiencies of the child-care industry and/or state governments. The child-care industry must become more flexible to consumer needs. To this end, the New South Wales Community Child Care Association is interested in working with the federal government to restructure the industry to avoid these industrial problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill divides women by creating a two-tiered system: women who deserve child-care assistance and women who do not. Women at home are considered to be not working and to have freely chosen this option, and they must therefore accept the economic disadvantage&mdash;notwithstanding unemployment, lack of marketable skills and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Colette Taylor from the National Advisory Council on Child Care advises that quality child care is a positive contributory factor in child development, although this is not essential if there are compensatory environmental factors. Since child-care assistance is already means tested, who will be disadvantaged by the cutback? The most vulnerable women and children. Few women in this low income category have equal choices regarding work and non-work. Many are rural, unemployable, in temporary situations, de-skilled, living within ethnic traditions or have husbands in the process of relocating. Some may even choose to stay at home with their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill clearly disadvantages those so-called non-working parents. Staying at home with children full time puts enormous stress on family life. There are potentially negative health repercussions for women not having adequate access to respite. Family life is also affected as well as health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill reinforces the idea that parents who are not in the work force are not working. It does nothing to address the consideration of women's unpaid work and the need for the inclusion of unpaid work in the national accounts. A comment by the Women's Electoral Lobby is very pertinent here. As well as wanting that kind of consideration in the national accounts, WEL made the comment that this bill also reinforces the government's agenda of constructing the role of women as workers. Women will progressively face the same discriminations that non-working men face, regardless of the socioeconomic environment, and be penalised for not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are women penalised but so are their children. The government's argument that the long day care centres exploit the system by charging a full day for fewer hours used is not the fault of women and children. They should not be used to fix this problem. To reiterate, it is an industrial problem. Long day care centres should be more flexible and consumer oriented to meet the accreditation criteria. The government should use the accreditation process to bring private day care up to the mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees referred to the attempt towards cost shifting being made by the states. In a similar fashion, if the states are not fulfilling their role in relation to preschools, the federal government must deal with that as a separate issue. Women cannot be the scapegoat for Treasury's problems. Child care should focus primarily on the needs of children. Child care is a very important educational and social vehicle for young children, and children need child care. This bill is interventionist it its approach. It is taking away the role of child-care centres in determining allocations of `priority four' places. It is not proper to penalise the access of those children by means of this legislative device. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have moved an amendment which will allow a delay in consideration of this bill. The Greens support the Democrat amendment, even though we can give no commitment to passing the bill at the proposed date of their motion if no changes occur. So it is basically up to the government. If the government or the opposition support the Democrat motion, there will be further opportunity for consultation and change. If not, because we do not support the bill in its present form, it will fail now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill and to make a couple of points. I would like to start with Senator Troeth's assumption or comment that there was no consultation with the industry prior to the budget. Either Senator Troeth is foreshadowing a new way that the opposition will bring down its budgets or she does not understand the process that budget measures do involve consultation beforehand. That is a very important point that I think needs to be raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth also spoke about a large number of letters.

The majority were certainly from Queensland. There are obviously problems up there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will not change Western civilisation as we know it. It will guarantee the children of families that do not have both parents at work or, in the case of single parent families, one parent at work, access to 12 hours of care a week. That is about the average for preschool. We have heard a lot about that point&mdash;that this is about the average for preschools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite keep talking about preschools, but what we have not heard very much about is that preschool is for the year or maybe the 18 months before children go to school; that is, it is for the time just prior to their reaching the age of about five. We have not heard from any of the people opposite anything about the fact that there is still a shortage of nought to three places within child care for work related child care. That is the critical age group that people seem to be forgetting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have not heard about the hours these centres are opened or where they are positioned, like not positioning them anywhere near where major employment is so that people can drop their children off as they leave home. For example, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, people who work in Sydney are spending an hour to an hour and a half travelling each way each day. If the child-care centres are situated close to their homes but are open only from, say, 7.30 or 8 in the morning to 5.30 or 6 in the evening, no person working in the city has a snowflake's chance of utilising the child-care centres close to their home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care centres say, `We have a centre here and we cannot get people to fill it.' It is a bit like train timetables&mdash;there's never a train when you want the rotten thing. There are a number of situations that show that the placement and hours of opening of child-care centres are not appropriate to the needs of the people using them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no hesitation in saying that child care for work-related needs has to be our prime consideration. There are a lot of single parents out there, as well as double income parents, who have this need. There is also a need for people to access education. People are allowed to do that under these circumstances but that just keeps being temporarily forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be aware that access to child care is important but looking after children is more than putting them in child-care centres. We have to be aware that the needs of children and the needs of families to be supported in their caring role is not solved just by child-care services. It is solved by looking at a very wide range of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parenting is one of the very few occupations in this or any other country for which you require no qualifications, no training, no degrees, no education, no support, nothing. You can rear a family on your own with nothing being offered. The opposition&mdash;we heard this from Senator Troeth&mdash;has said how important this sort of care is but what Senator Troeth is ignoring is what the states are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She should look at what is happening in her state of Victoria with the early childhood services&mdash;the restriction on the number of times a family can take their babies and young toddlers to early childhood nurses, people who are in the business of caring and providing support and education to families. We hear from the opposition how wonderful child care is but the same opposition supports people who have cut other services to families with children&mdash;a slight double standard I think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important service for families with children, particularly where there is one family member at home&mdash;as a former early childhood nurse, I speak with some experience&mdash;is the provision of occasional care. If 12 hours a week had been available in the years when I was practising, many families would have found that a wonderful boon, enabling them to meet their commitments outside, to do their shopping, to enable their children to socialise, to enable mum or dad, whoever the key carer is, to catch their breath and get on with living. But we also need parenting programs&mdash;the systematic training for effective parenting&mdash;those types of skills, those types of programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care is an integral part of supporting the family but it is not the only part. One witness pointed out how vitally important it was for low socio-economic families to access 60 hours of child care a week. I was most offended by that because it was a direct insinuation that parents from those low socio-economic groups are not good parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good parents come in all shapes and sizes and from all socio-economic categories. They have a number of things in common. They benefit from some hours a week access to occasional care, as this legislation will enable them to have. They also benefit from being freely able to access early childhood services when they feel the need for them, on many occasions just to seek reassurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents do a good job but from the evidence we received I came away with the impression that some people thought parents were not doing a good job. Parents are basically doing an okay job and they need to be told that. They do not need to be told that they need to put little Johnnie or Susan at age two into child care for 60 hours a week because they can be better cared for in a child-care centre. That is not the way we should be supporting our families. I am all in favour of 12 hours a week but this is all about what people get when they access preschools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting thing I noted was the names of a number of centres included the words `kindy' or `preschool'. That gives the immediate impression that this is not a long day child-care centre, it is a kindy with 9 to 3 sort of hours, which I thought was most misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin said that a big proportion of mothers prefer to be at home caring for their children. I think that is right. I therefore assume that a big proportion of mothers do not want to be sending off their children to long day care centres for any more than about 12 hours a week because they are enjoying being with their children, being able to reinforce and work with programs that the centres are using, making sure that both sides benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also found it interesting that whereas the opposition is opposed to this legislation and also appears to be opposed to increased expenditure on child care we have not heard any policies from them, apart from income testing. I thought that was very interesting. Again, they are opposing things but offering no policy changes, no policy direction, no policy about where they think they might want to go. If the legislation is so bad, they should be looking at how it can be fixed, but that is not their way of operating. </PARA>

When we hear this bad news, we readjust by mobilising all of us in the streets, and it is the first times in the story of Polynesia more than 15,000 persons were there, and on the 26 of August the Evangelique Church decided to protest at the front of the President of our government M.FLOSSE. This last one says that there is no pollution in Mururoa, and television shows him his friends and military swimming in the sea, eating fishes and drinking coconut water from Mururoa and Fangataufa. M.Flosse is a real comedian, we don't understand him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have with me documents signed by Mururoa workers testifying that many of them have been suffering from illness whose nature has always been covered by the french military doctors, they have lost many of their friends as a result of these unknown illness. I have also a map showing Mururoa in&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I am afraid the date was obscured here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">made by French army, most all the Island is contaminated. You can see on this map many cracks of 4 or 8 km long and some cracks are very large. And we must not forget that the Island is sinking down; the french military has to fill up the road before they repair. Most all the small "motu" around Mururoa are in the sea now. They have to build another big wall to hold the Island of Mururoa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I bring also with me reports written by Cousteau saying that he is worrying about the avenir of Mururoa. He said that in the future the reserve Radioactivity inside the socle of Mururoa can leak in the Ocean. He found the strontium 90, the cesium 137 and others radioactive elements which can contaminate in 100 years. He found also the cesium 131 and 134 coming from underground testings, that means: all the portions coming from the atmosphere testings (4) and underground testings (134) are there; and they are killing us slowly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not a scientific but I am sure that all the population of Polynesia die from the cancer. My mother is dead from the cancer of stomach. My Brother Paul is dead from general cancer. My sister Celestine is dead from cancer of lungs. My sister Leonie is dead from cancer of lungs. My sister Liliane is dead from cancer of breast and My sister Madeline and myself had the cancer of the breast. Both of us have had operation; and thank God who (help) us and keep us alive. I have also a report written by M. Bruno Barri bringing together facts and figures on the repercussions of the French nuclear testing programme in Polynesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I bring also a report from my cousin Marcel TAUR who were sick while he was soldier in Mururoa. He went surfing in the sea; he got very sick; all skin come out even his hair drop down; mother has to ask the army to bring him back to Tahiti; and since that time he has always problem health.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can a man, only one person, can decide the destiny of thousands of people living in the Pacific? I have 4 children and 5 grandchildren; I love them very much; that's why I fight to protect their environment so they can love and stay in good health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">God did not create the land to be destroyed. God did not create mankind to destroy each other. I appeal to all the women here to help us so M.Chirac will change his mind for our future generations. We are people of the sea and we find our basic food in this natural resource which is the Pacific Ocean. France always says, LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY. But I know that we cannot have EQUALITY without LIBERTY. We cannot have FRATERNITY without LIBERTY and we cannot have LIBERTY without DECOLONISATION.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that M.Chirac is a creature of God like us. He is perfect because he has the image and the resemblance of God, so there is nothing bad inside him, and I am sure that he will come back on his decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the Senate's attention to the siting of mobile phone towers, MPTs&mdash;also called cellsite masts&mdash;in school grounds. The implications for children's health are my primary concern. But other issues, such as privatisation and sponsorship are also important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Christchurch, New Zealand, this year, the Ministry of Education reversed a decision to allow Telecom to approach schools for permission to erect mobile phone transmitters on school grounds. This followed a stormy debate about the safety of MPTs, when Telecom New Zealand approached seven schools for permission to rent space for $4,500 per year. Parents felt that, lacking conclusive evidence that transmitters were not harmful, even the slightest risk of harming children's health was not worth taking. Their Ministry of Education agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand policy change was partly due to two recent studies. One of those studies was by Dr Neil Cherry of Lincoln University, Christchurch, in April 1995. His report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Potential and actual adverse effects of cellsite microwave radiation</EMPHASIS>, in summary states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Microwave radiation is a contaminant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Precautionary Principle should be recognised due to the lack of full scientific certainty. In the case of cellsite (mobile phone site) microwave radiation it suggests the application of minimal exposure and prudent avoidance, especially for the very young, child-bearing women and the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children absorb microwave radiation at a greater rate than adults&mdash;in fact, 3.3 times of radiated power per kilogram than an adult. There is a strong interaction of the mutagenic potential of microwave radiation which urgently needs to be re-evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Cherry's report further recommends recognising the epidemiological and biophysical evidence which points to significant actual and potential adverse human health impacts due to cumulative effects of continuous, pulsed, low levels of microwaves, such as those radiated from cell sites, with such adverse effects as DNA breakdown, leukaemia, miscarriage and reduced immune performance. Tower sites should not be located in or near schools, kindergartens, daycare and play centres where children and pregnant mothers spend long periods of time. They should be separated from schools and residences by such distances that the intensity of the microwaves, when averaged over a year, does not exceed 0.1 microwatts per square centimetre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report, from Australia's CSIRO Division of Radiophysics, of June 1994, called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Status of research on biological effects in safety of electromagnetic radiation: telecommunications frequencies</EMPHASIS>, was initiated by the Spectrum Management Agency, SMA, to review worldwide research on effects of radiofrequency radiation on humans. Contrary to SMA's public position, it documents many adverse health effects of radiofrequency at power levels well below the threshold for thermal effects. It includes epidemiological studies showing increased risks of leukaemia, eye cataracts and a suspected link with breast cancer. The CSIRO study also found that there can be adverse effects on human immune systems below maximum permitted levels of 1 milliwatt per square centimetre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States, Motorola, the US telecommunications corporation, has a policy of not siting radio antennas on school property&mdash;due to growing public opposition to MPTs in or near school grounds. In San Francisco the proposal to put a low-power radio transmitter on the roof of a public high school prompted the city's school board to prohibit MPTs on school property. Their decision was based on advice from Dr Raymond Neutra of the California Department of Health Services who said, `Other than the rental income, why would a responsible public agency go out of its way to expose children to an agent that was not necessary for their education and was not thoroughly studied?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Sydney, the Harbord community has objected to Telstra's decision to erect a MPT next to the local kindergarten that has been operating for over 40 years. Parents were not convinced by assurances from the Australian Radiation Laboratory that emissions were well below the Australian safety standards and were removing their children from the place, so the kindergarten was facing closure. Eight days of protest and parents chaining themselves to the gate forced Telstra to reverse its decision&mdash;a significant victory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be strongly stated that these parents took the only option open to them, that of protest action. The federal government's exemptions granted to the telecommunications industry provide it with immunity from all state and local planning and environment laws that apply to any other individual or business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Adelaide, 11 citizen groups are campaigning to have the South Australian Minister for Education ban MPTs on school grounds. Press reports reveal that the South Australian government is considering whether to permit mobile phone towers in schools and, if permitted, under what guidelines. One proposal is by Telstra-Vodaphone to site a MPT adjacent to a kindergarten in Mitcham. A Telecom radiation expert conceded during a visit to the site that `it was inadvisable to position these towers beside schools or kindergartens'. One must ask: why? Dr George Tallis, consultant endocrinologist and chemical pathologist from Flinders Medical Centre advised Mitcham Council in February 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current medical evidence is insufficient to decide whether electromagnetic radiation is carcinogenic or not. The standards are all quite arbitrary. In their submission Austel indicated that they are currently researching the issue. $1.2 million has been awarded to Royal Adelaide Hospital physicist, Dr Michael Repacholi, to look at relevant radiation effects in mice. The US have already committed $65M US to ongoing research. This is science in evolution.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Tallis referred to a recent paper from Mount Sinai Medical Centre, New York, that stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . until recently the effects of low level radiation have been underestimated. Effects of weak electromagnetic fields on living systems are currently being intensively studied, and clear effects have been established. A number of experiments have demonstrated that weak electromagnetic fields are capable of eliciting effects in different biological systems. </PARA>
<PARA>So why do we have this conflict? Unfortunately, official policy considers only thermal biological effects in setting safety standards. These result from high<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>levels of electromagnetic radiation which have sufficient energy to heat up body tissue. This school of thought is represented by Dr Michael Repacholi, chair of the recent Standards Australia subcommittee, which recommended increasing present levels by a factor of five. On page 41 of the proposed standard, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when only the established . . . literature is used, exposure limits can only be based on thermal effects in the frequency range about 10Mhz to 300Ghz. The . . . literature shows that while non thermal exposures may cause very minor perturbations to biological systems (isolated cells or tissues, but not in humans) there has not been found any adverse health impact from these exposure levels after almost 40 years of research.</PARA>
<PARA>This approach denies the growing body of scientific research indicating that low level, non-thermal&mdash;athermal&mdash;levels of radiofrequency radiation may very well be hazardous. On 25 July my office wrote to Professor Ross Adey, the US veterans' administration senior researcher at its medical centre in California. Professor Adey is a world authority on the biological effects of radiofrequency and microwave radiation. He is currently conducting multimillion dollar research funded by Motorola, the world's biggest mobile phone company. Professor Adey was asked by my office, `Based on the current scientific knowledge, is it advisable to base radiofrequency maximum exposure limits&mdash;standards&mdash;solely on thermal effects?' Professor Adey replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You ask about exposure limits based on thermal effects. The laboratory evidence for athermal effects of both ELF and RF/microwave fields now constitutes a major body of scientific literature in peer-reviewed journals. It is my personal view that to continue to ignore this work in the course of standard setting is irresponsible to the point of being a public scandal. Please be advised that the US National Council of Radiation Protection and Measurements has recently established a committee with the sole mandate of reviewing the role of modulation effects with health implications, in conditions where athermal exposures are paramount. Committee 53 of NCRP published its report in 1986 and drew attention to the potential importance of ELF modulation patterns in determining health-related effects. Indeed, the very existence of modulation frequency-dependent effects bespeaks athermal interactions.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it advisable then to place MPTs on or near school grounds, playgrounds and so on using safety standards which ignore a large body of scientific evidence which indicates a potential health hazard to children? If it is not advisable, why allow it? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government does not plan to extend the cross runway at Brisbane Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The FAC advises that the cost of extending the runway to a length of 2600 metres, and adequately to support operations of an Airbus A300, would be around $150m. The June 1991 Task Force Report commissioned by the Department of Transport and Communications estimated the cost of extending the runway to a length of 3600m, suitable for unrestricted operations of B747 aircraft, to be approximately an additional $228 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) This question can be answered with reference to the noise impacts of different runway options at Brisbane Airport as considered in the June 1991 report of the Task Force to Review the Operation and Planning of Brisbane Airport to Minimise the Impact of Aircraft Noise on Surrounding Communities. Using a methodology based on a study carried out by the National Acoustic Laboratories, the analysis of the options showed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using the current north-south runway as the main runway in 2010, approximately 1,900 people would be at least moderately affected by aircraft noise, including around 400 people who would be seriously affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the cross runway were extended to 2600m and used as the main runway in 2010, approximately 300 people would be at least moderately affected by aircraft noise, including around 100 people who would be seriously affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the cross runway were extended to 2600m and traffic were distributed between the two runways based on the projected 1995 traffic mix, approximately 1300 people would be at least moderately affected by aircraft noise, including around 300 people who would be seriously affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that with the transfer of operations to an extended cross runway, there would be a number of people living close to the extended centreline of the cross runway that would be newly affected by aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Airservices Australia advises that approximately 50 per cent of aircraft taking off, and 36 per cent of aircraft landing, fly over residential areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) There is currently no curfew applying at Brisbane Airport. The original Master Plan for the new Brisbane International Airport was predicated on the airport being curfew free. The Master Plan cited a combination of more stringent aircraft noise standards, the phasing out of older, noisy aircraft and greatly increased separation of residential areas from runways as reasons why a curfew should not be introduced for the new Brisbane Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government established a Task Force in 1989 to make recommendations on how the impact of aircraft noise arising from operations at Brisbane Airport could be minimised, while still providing an airport that would meet Brisbane's needs into the future. In accordance with the original planning criteria for the airport, one of the guidelines that the Task Force was required by the Government to take into account was that Brisbane Airport was to remain curfew free.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The cost of the name change was $79,500. This includes design work, mailing campaign advising of name change, signage and the launch at Parliament House. The cost of the name change and launch represented 0.005 percent of the total 1994-95 aid program and 0.17 percent of the 1994-95 administration costs of the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The costing of the name change was not included in the 1995-96 Budget because the name change and launch occurred and were funded in the 1994-95 financial year. Funding was sourced from two AusAID appropriations: Running Costs; and Development Education and Public Information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) There was a low level of public recognition of the Agency's previous name and acronym. The old acronym did not signify a clear connection with overseas aid. A community attitudes survey conducted in 1994 confirmed this. The survey found that only one in ten people had heard of the organisation, and less than one third of those knew what the AIDAB acronym stood for. When spelt out AIDAB was a cumbersome and complicated title. The new name, AusAID, is easy to use and readily identifies the nature of the agency's work; AusAID is Australian aid. It is the Government's hope and expectation that a better knowledge of what AusAID is will lead to more interest in, and support for, the Australian overseas aid program which AusAID administers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There was a low level of public recognition of the Agency's previous name and acronym. The old acronym did not signify a clear connection with overseas aid. A community attitudes survey conducted in 1994 confirmed this. The survey found that only one in ten people had heard of the organisation, and less than one third of those knew what the AIDAB acronym stood for. When spelt out AIDAB was a cumbersome and complicated title. The new name, AusAID, is easy to use and readily identifies the nature of the Agency's work; AusAID is Australian aid. It is the Government's hope and expectation that a better knowledge of what AusAID is will lead to more interest in, and support for, the Australian overseas aid program which AusAID administers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The cost of the name change was $79,500. This includes design work, signage, the launch at Parliament House and postage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Existing stocks of stationery were run down prior to the launch in order to minimise costs. Stocks of AIDAB stationery remaining at the time of the name change will continue to be used within AusAID until exhausted. There is a reduced need for new printed stationery in AusAID as the Agency has adopted the use of computer generated macros for producing a variety of stationery; for example, ministerial submissions, minute paper and letterhead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No consultants were employed to oversee the change in name. The only services sourced outside AusAID in relation to the name change were for logo and publication design. Costs for these services are included in the figure provided in response to Question 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The cost of changing the signs at AusAID offices amounted to $35,320.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No direct marketing was used to announce the name change. However, as noted in relation to Question 8 below, letters were sent to Members of Parliament, Government officials, non-government organisations and community representatives informing them of the name change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Individuals and organisations notified of the name change were: selected Heads of Government and other ministers in South Pacific island countries; Ambassadors and High Commissioners accredited to Australia; all members of the Commonwealth Parliament; media; non-government organisations; Commonwealth government departments; businesses involved in the delivery of the aid program; Australian tertiary institutions; and heads of donor agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Letters and information about the name change were sent by mail to a broad range of people, organisations and governments as indicated in response to Question 7. In addition, a photographic exhibition titled AusAID Works for a Better World was opened in Parliament House in conjunction with the announcement of the name change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The cost of the strategies noted in the preceding answer amounted to approximately $31,000, out of the total cost of $79,500 noted in response to Question 2.</PARA>
