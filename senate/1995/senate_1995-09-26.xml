<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Cook, the industry minister. It is sort of a dorothy dixer because I wanted to give the minister the chance to assure the Senate that his colleagues Stephen Smith and Wayne Swan are wrong and that his proposed innovation statement is not `a bronze medal strategy' and not `absolutely lacking in substance'. But, more importantly, Minister, I ask you: how can industry have confidence in you when, despite all the hype, this innovation statement is delayed month after month after month, is still regarded by your colleagues as woefully inadequate, and has in fact had to have been taken out of your hands by the Prime Minister, ultimately to be delivered by him?  Doesn't this debacle further demonstrate a government that has run out of ideas and also of steam?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Deputy President. This is the first time I have been in the chamber since you have been in the chair. Congratulations to you on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Turning to the question, the first thing I can say about this is it is a pity this is not an economic question because I understand the much vaunted debt truck broke down on the hill to Lawson in the Blue Mountains today, which just shows that not only is it a fraudulent scam but also they cannot even maintain the engine of an imported lorry of lies!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This question is about the innovation statement. If the sincerest form of flattery is imitation, then the opposition is engaging in flattery indeed when it comes to the government. I posted at last year's ANZAAS meeting in Geelong the intention of this government to bring down an innovation statement this year. Just about a month ago the opposition decided to get into the act and it announced that its next headland speech would be on innovation. It was only about nine or 10 months too late from the initiative taken by the government, but I congratulate the opposition on trying to catch up to us. It is a commendable effort by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the outcome of the 2,000-odd consultations that I and my colleague ministers have had with Australian business and with Australian scientists and technicians around Australia and which in the middle of the year we published as a compendium of all the views submitted to the government across the board is of some use to the opposition as a resource document when they are scratching for an idea to include in their innovation statement, the next headland speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To the rest of these questions, I could say you would like that to be the case, Senator Hill. Pity for you it is not. Pity for you that a reporter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper yesterday wrote a column which he did not bother to check with my office about. If he had done that, he would have found out what the truth of the matter was, rather than reporting some gossip from apparently the passage and alleyways of this building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are, of course, that there has been no such reaction by the caucus committee or, indeed, by any factional grouping in this parliament in the manner reported in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper. One of the reasons why there has not is that I have actually not told anyone what will be in the innovation statement. Because I have not told them, they cannot form a view about it, and because they cannot form a view about it, they cannot grade it as to whether it is a bronze medal or a gold medal. But I might say that this parliament can look forward to it being a gold medal, because it will be a substantial statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental point the government is driving at here is that, since we have opened the Australian economy and made the Australian economy more internationally competitive, we are looking at ways of making Australia a winner in the international marketplace. Innovation&mdash;the bringing together of Australia's long-established reputation in science and technology as a leading nation in the world in that field with our entrepreneurial skill and our commercial sector&mdash;will ensure that Australia is a winner in the international economy, that we think innovatively at all levels of management, that we use our science and technology base to create new ideas and new products from those ideas, and that Australians can look forward to better, more intelligent jobs in a more competitive industry at the leading edge in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the innovation statement is about. That is what you are trying to catch up with. Please try very hard, but we will be there on the day. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RC6">Senator WHEELWRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook. I draw his attention to the fact that, in one of its rare statements on science, the opposition has claimed that the government is not supporting Australian scientists and that the quality of Australian science is declining. So I ask the minister if he can inform the Senate of current information about the state of Australian science and scientists?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1412" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the honour to open yesterday's 64th ANZAAS conference, which is a pre-eminent gathering of Australian and New Zealand scientists; and the opening of this prestigious event is, in fact, the right place for the science minister to have been. I was able to point out the clear fact that the latest OECD figures now rank Australia fourth in the OECD in terms of public sector expenditure on research and development expressed as a percentage of GDP. We were ranked seventh out of 25 on that index, but last year Australia moved ahead of France, the Netherlands and Germany and is now only led by the three Scandinavian countries. That is a matter for celebration for Australia. We have a strong public sector commitment to science. We are ranked fourth in the developed world in terms of public sector expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition, we have a real and longstanding commitment to science. The real value of total spending on science since we came to office in 1983 has increased by 56 per cent&mdash;that is, in real dollars our commitment to science has gone up by 56 per cent compared with that of the opposition when they were in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I announced at ANZAAS a study to benchmark Australia's science and innovation system. The study, conducted by the Bureau of Industry Economics in consultation with my department, the Australian Research Council, the Industry, Research and Development Board and the science academies, compared Australia with more than 20 OECD and Asian countries in order to assess how we rate in the world. The study is close to publication, but I can reveal some of the data that has come out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study paints a picture of Australia as a reasonably well balanced and, for its size, an influential science country which remains much more sophisticated than the science systems emerging within the regional economies. The study has some particularly interesting information about human resources in science. Australia now has a higher than OECD average concentration of researchers, scientists and engineers engaged in research and development. The growth rate in the numbers of students graduating in science and engineering in Australia is one of the highest in the world. The proportion of women graduating in science and engineering is now one of the highest in the world, as is the number of women moving into research in the public and private sectors. The age profile of scientists and engineers is younger in Australia than is the case in most developed countries. The concentration of research and development personnel in our total work force has increased by 25 per cent since the 1980s and is higher than the median for the OECD economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the myths that circulate is that there is a brain drain from Australia of scientists going overseas. The facts are that every year for the past 10 years there has been an increase of scientists and engineers migrating to Australia&mdash;a net increase of some 30,000 scientists and engineers during that period. That is a brain gain, not a brain drain. There is a waiting list for scientists wanting to come here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on, but, quite significantly, when this study is fully presented, it will show that under the administration of this government we have spent the public dollar wisely to increase our capacity as a nation in science, engineering and innovation, which are key drivers of economic growth and which create intelligent and rewarding jobs for Australians. As a consequence of our strength in this field, we are now developing a whole string of new industries which will provide intelligent and challenging jobs for the next generation of Australians and make sure the Australian economy is a strong economy in this, the highest growth area of the world. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Is it not a fact, however, based on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine information drawn on by the Prime Minister, that Australia's nominal short-term interest rates are the fourth highest of any industrialised OECD country; our nominal 10-year government bond yields are the fourth highest; our real short-term interest rates are actually the third highest when we use the underlying inflation rate, which is the one which the government constantly claims is the most appropriate and accurate measure of inflation; and we have the second highest real government bond yields, which is the rate which most influences our interest rate environment?

What I can say to you is: a great many things have moved on since then, except the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense to accuse this government of ignoring the needs of women and families that are suffering from exceptional drought. Unlike the previous coalition government&mdash;and the record shows it&mdash;which did absolutely nothing, this government has moved significantly to increase the participation of women in a whole range of areas. We have made real progress in working with rural women to increase their participation. We have made significant strides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said recently that, since assuming responsibility for this portfolio, the lack of women involved in rural policy making, particularly with the myriad of boards in this portfolio, is of real concern to me. It is not only unfair to exclude 30 per cent of farmers&mdash;which is what women are in rural Australia&mdash;but it also works against our best interests. The government has taken a number of significant steps to address this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A rural women's unit has been established in my department and a national women's coordinator appointed. We provided funding to support the first international women in agriculture conference held in Melbourne last year&mdash;to the best of my knowledge, the first in the world. We also co-sponsored the first national rural women's forum. The secretary to my department is establishing a rural women's consultative committee to advise on what other measures we need to take. A strategy to address the number of women on government bodies is being developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have appointed, for the first time, women to chair the selection committees that operate in this portfolio that make recommendations to government on those appointments. We are working with industry organisations on what we all need to do to increase the representation of women on industry groups and bodies. Women are already well represented in important areas of land care and rural financial counselling. Senators may be interested to hear that a recent Victorian study showed that the higher the percentage of women in land care groups, the more effective those groups were, which is a clear argument in favour of making sure that we include women in the whole range of groups and processes to do with rural Australia. The government, rural women and industry are all working together successfully in this area and we will continue to do so.</PARA>

The environmental impact assessment is because of EFIC's involvement as an Australian government agency. If the Australian company is investing in another country, the responsibility for the environmental protection in that country is, of course, the sovereign responsibility of the host country, not ours; any more than we would expect the United States to conduct environmental impact statements about investments in Australia, which we would think would be an abrogation of our sovereignty and we would not allow.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about exports from our country overseas. If you do not agree with this, I would be very interested to hear. In many countries it is a particular export interest, and this is an issue which my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and I and our respective officials have been working on very hard. I am stunned that a representative of the National Party does not think our trying to get our agricultural produce exported is a good idea, but you are welcome to have that view, and I am pleased to have it on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has before it a very long list of well over 50 barriers established on purported quarantine grounds by our trading partners, and we are establishing priorities to try to get our cherries, grapes, and other such fruit, and tomatoes into Japan. We are also trying to get oranges, apples, table grapes, et cetera into Korea. If I recall correctly, I think it was the Premier, Mr Groom, on behalf of the Tasmanian state government, who led a delegation to Korea recently on this question of trying to get access for Tasmanian fruit to Korea because he was concerned about the unreasonable quarantine barriers that were being erected. I think that is correct and, if it is correct, I congratulate him on that initiative. It is something he should have done, and I am sure that he will apply that same principle consistently elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have concerns about, and significant activities about, attempts to get apples, pears and citrus fruit into China, and the list could go on and on. As more and more of Australia's agricultural industries become more export oriented, this is going to become an increasingly important issue. As a result of the Uruguay Round reforms, protectionist quarantine restrictions have become more exposed in these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the activities of our diplomatic and trade representatives, and our quarantine and DPIE representatives, we are working very hard to open these markets previously closed by quarantine restrictions. Of course, any country, including Australia, is permitted to impose quarantine restrictions where they are justified on scientific grounds, and we cannot justify seeking to have those overturned where they have a proper scientific basis. It is very vital to a country such as Australia, which exports five times more food than it imports, that these international disciplines are applied and that agricultural barriers are not therefore artificially allowed to be raised against our products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a principal issue of concern to the Cairns Group and to our partners in the Cairns Group. It also relates to some of the concerns about APEC, and why we are trying to make sure that our activities there are comprehensive.

In Japan and the United States recently we have been able to make progress to get more access, particularly for our citrus fruit but across a range of other products as well, and it is very important to the future of those industries. The export figures that those successes reflect represent your starting points for industries shifting from a solely domestic focus to exports, and it will continue to be a priority for us to try to create these opportunities and the consequent prosperity for our rural communities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Is it a fact that Booz-Allen and Hamilton estimated that closing this gap would save the beef industry at least $750 million a year? Does the minister agree that savings of this magnitude could well have been sufficient to keep open those Queensland meatworks which have closed in recent days because they are uncompetitive?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying that a range of factors is responsible for the current downturn, and the industry has correctly made those public. The major reasons are a flat international market and reduced profit margins exacerbated by rising domestic prices and, as Senator Boswell acknowledged yesterday, influenced by the drought and high feed grain prices that are a result. They are the major reasons, including of course the appreciation of the value of the Australian dollar of around five per cent.</PARA>

Is it not a fact that an independent report commissioned by the Department of Industrial Relations found that progress in workplace reform in the export meat processing sector has generally been limited with little to show in terms of widespread and quantifiable increase in productivity and efficiency and that enterprise bargains agreed to date in many cases have been little more than a means to achieve a general wage increase?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The home and community care program is one of this government's proud achievements. It is a joint program with the states and it has been the key to keeping older frail Australians out of institutions and to assisting people with disabilities in the same way. What we know from those elderly people, and also people with disability, is that they would much prefer to live out their lives in their own homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government introduced the home and community care program in 1984-85. That was a very important step towards dealing with the chaos left by the previous coalition government and its very ad hoc system of care, which was based on institutional care. The government has increased the funding for that program from $70 million when the program was started to over $423 million this financial year&mdash;something like a 243 per cent increase in real terms. There are something like 7,000 projects operating from 4,600 outlets, and they cover over a million people a year&mdash;220,000 people a month. We know that those people are being assisted in a whole variety of ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to that, this year we have seen a significant increase in a new addition to that program&mdash;the community aged care packages. It is another initiative which is a complete package for in-home care needs for the frail aged.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those numbers have gone from 527 in 1992-93 to 4,195 in 1995-96, with an extra $34.8 million. As I have said already, we do know that people would much prefer to live out their lives in their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sometimes said that Australia is an uncaring country for its elderly people, but I need to remind people, including the opposition, that only about 12 per cent of elderly Australians finish up in nursing homes or hostels. By my calculations, that is 88 per cent who live out their lives at home supported by their families, and very often managing for themselves to the very end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we also know is that many of the people who are elderly in this country are not frail or debilitated and they are able to contribute fairly dramatically to our society. In fact, if you really want to check it, see who is still delivering meals on wheels. Mostly they are the elderly people in our society&mdash;active and fit and wanting to have a go. I think it is vitally important that we recognise that our policies deal with the frail elderly, particularly to support them being able to live out their lives at home, and particularly to support families to help with that care. That is exactly what those community aged care packages are for.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;June&mdash;I think Senator Ray was there at the time. It is a plan of action to do a number of things; it was based on five fundamental principles. They were to focus on movements within the Indo-Chinese region; to discourage clandestine departures and to establish a regular program of departures; to institute regional refugee status determination procedures; to organise the resettlement of those who arrived in the first asylum camps before cut-off dates; and also to organise the return of non-refugees to their country of origin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a plan it has been enormously successful. In its time of operation some 80,000 people have been resettled in destinations other than Vietnam. In terms of Australia, we have taken some 18,500 Indo-Chinese under the CPA, with another 300 or so being resettled in this program year. As well as that 80,000, some 72,000 have returned to Vietnam, and there are now some 41,000 in camps&mdash;and they are the ones who, of course, have been screened out by the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time concerns have been raised about the processing and whether, in fact, it has been an honest processing. We have tackled this issue in this parliament&mdash;in the Senate, in fact&mdash;a number of times and, as a government, I have raised the matter with the UNHCR on both the regional and international levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can, Senator Teague, provide for you copies of the relevant correspondence and assurances we have had&mdash;assurances which I think were tabled in this place at the start of this year. The allegations that you refer to in the request for review are not those of the immediate past; they have been around for some time. They were issues which the Senate focused on at an earlier date some few months ago. I can make that information available to you again; it was, in fact, tabled in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been keen to ensure that the processes have been aboveboard. We have received from the UNHCR unequivocal assurances that no-one whom it has assessed as a genuine refugee has been screened out or returned to Vietnam. That is an assurance which is quite basic to the integrity of the process. As I say, when you look at the process involved here, you will see that the process is one that is administered by the countries of first asylum, and it is monitored closely by UNHCR. We have had assurances from them and, once again, whatever might be available I can make available to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the US situation, there is a bit of game playing going on in the US. That is very unfortunate because the member parties to the CPA have made a decision to essentially wind up the process by the end of this year and to return those who have been screened out and who are not entitled to refugee status to Vietnam by the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, with the takeover in the US Congress, there has been a different focus applied to the CPA from there. As a consequence of that, there has been an attempt there, by the introduction of legislation, to try to divert the US government's support for the CPA and its conclusion. I think that offers false hope to the people in the camps&mdash;and that is the unfortunate aspect of it. It is a bill in the US Senate which was predicated on the congressional report that you have referred to&mdash;one which, I must state, was based on political motivation rather than any sense of reality of what is happening in the camps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that particular bill offered false hope; it has been shelved indefinitely. However, I also understand that, even if it had succeeded in the US Congress, there was a fair chance that the President might veto it. That particular bill, offering false hope to people who are left in the camps, people who have been screened out, people who should go back by the end of the year, means that they may be expecting to have a chance to go to the US.

Has the minister seen Kenneth Davidson's article in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> entitled `Murdoch's pay TV deal: we pay so he can make billions'? Is it the case that Telstra is required to take on liabilities in the order of $2.2 billion over 25 years to protect its $4 billion investment in Foxtel because the Fox programming, which is all Mr Murdoch's company brought to the partnership, is inadequate to sustain a pay TV network? If so, when was the minister told about this? When were the Telstra directors on the Foxtel board told about this? Was the minister required to approve the deal and, if so, why did he so do?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Senator Bourne, for the question. The article you refer to has been drawn to my attention. You will be shocked to know that I did not pour over it on Saturday, but it has been drawn to my attention. My understanding is that the $2.2 billion is part of a shared $4.4 billion liability by both parties to the agreement. That adds a little bit of perspective, and that needs to be recalled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, the minister's advice to me is that the Telstra news corporation cable television venture announced on 9 March is something that he welcomes. It involves an accelerated improvement in communications infrastructure and indicates Telstra's preparedness to respond to the competition being provided by Optus. He is aware, as I am now, of press speculation concerning the possibility of payments arising due to the commercial agreements that Telstra has entered into for pay television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is just part of the outlay and process involved in an investment by Telstra on which it hopes and expects and is planning to make a return. It is proceeding on the basis that this will be a profitable investment. This is part of the process of developing, as it is for the news group which has taken on the same liabilities for the same reasons. The matters are ones that are properly determined by the Telstra board and their management, who I am advised have assessed the commercial risk in these transactions as acceptable to the company. As far as I know, the subscriber guarantees are a reasonably common feature of arrangements between program suppliers and pay TV operators, particularly in the early stages of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is aware&mdash;and I am now aware&mdash;of Telstra's involvement in this venture, but undertakings of this nature are matters for consideration and decision by the Telstra board. It is not for the Minister for Communications and the Arts to approve the deal. Consistent with the principles for GBE reporting established by this government and Telstra's articles of association, Telstra has kept the government informed of its intention. But, I repeat, it is not for the minister to approve a deal like this; it is a commercial venture approved by the board of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to when the directors of Foxtel or Telstra may have been told, the decision to commit to the joint venture proposal was properly a decision for the board and the minister does not feel that it is appropriate for him to comment on the details of those processes that they may have followed in the process. Similarly, arrangements for sharing in the profits are governed by a contract and partnership arrangements which are negotiated by Telstra on a fully commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise that on the advice I have received the article appears to focus on only one aspect of the arrangements. I want to re-emphasise that Telstra Multi-Media Pty Ltd has entered into the overall arrangement and intends to charge for the use of the cable and expects to obtain a commercial rate of return on its investment. That is why it has entered into the arrangement. To the best of my advice, it is not an unusual or unorthodox commercial arrangement and it is one on which they expect to return a profit on the shareholders' funds, which are the Australian people's funds.</PARA>

Secondly, if there is no change in the contracts and if no doctors enter into contracts, that will not make much difference at all. The system will continue as it is now. In other words, private health insurance will not be able to reassure patients that they have 100 per cent cover. Until the contracts with the doctors are entered into, very much the same system as is the case now will prevail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator Gareth Evans, I want to give some more information concerning an answer he supplied yesterday to Senator Woods. In answering a question yesterday from Senator Woods on freedom of information applications by the families of Kellie Wilkinson and David Wilson, Senator Evans undertook to check the status of the consideration of these requests. As Senator Evans indicated yesterday, these FOI requests relate to extremely tragic affairs and involve complex matters involving many months of government activity, and a number of issues go to intergovernmental relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both requests captured a vast amount of material, certainly many hundreds of documents in each case which have to be carefully assessed for release, and in many instances consultations have to be undertaken with other authorities and foreign governments involved in the cases. Senators will recall that in these tragic cases the Australian government worked closely with the British and French governments, which also had citizens involved, as well as the Cambodian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Wilkinson application, which was received by the department on 27 February this year, 112 documents were released to the applicant on 25 May. A similar number of documents were identified as requiring consultations with other authorities and governments as to their suitability for release. Where material reporting on their views or actions was captured, consultation had to be undertaken with New Scotland Yard by the AFP, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the US State Department, the Cambodian government, the United Nations Secretariat and the Office of the Governor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this has taken some time. However, this process of consultation is close to completion and the departmental decision maker appointed under the act will shortly be making a decision on most of the remaining material and advising the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FOI application from members of the Wilson family was received by the department on 15 June. The department in a letter to the applicants noted that this request was very complicated and would take some time to process. The departmental decision maker handling this request is now well advanced in his assessment of the material and it is anticipated that he will be writing to the applicants this week forwarding the first tranche of material for release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the department will be seeking to process material as quickly as possible, there is likely to be need in this case too for a number of consultations with other authorities and governments on the possible release of material which reports their views or actions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans and our department are committed to the principles of FOI and approach all applications with the disposition to release material wherever possible.

<PARA>This relates to Senator Cook's inability to deny the point made in my question that, when the government's own rate of inflation calculation is taken into account, Australia's real interest rates, both short-term and long-term, are in fact amongst the highest in the world. In his answer, Senator Cook stuck with the assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday that Australia's short term interest rates `are the seventh lowest in the OECD area' and that this was shown by statistics in the latest edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine. </PARA>

I also assume that they are basing this assertion on a graph in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> showing nominal interest rates less the inflation rate. The only way that you can manipulate the figures to achieve the Prime Minister's result&mdash;and even if one accepts that result, it is a pretty middling result at best&mdash;is to use as the relevant inflation rate what is nowadays termed in Australia as the headline rate of inflation; that is, in effect, the ordinary consumer price index. For years now this government has been asserting that the headline rate of inflation is not the true rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has, instead, chosen to use what it calls the underlying rate of inflation. The underlying rate of inflation is the headline rate adjusted to take out movements in mortgage interest rates, taxes, charges and several other items that affect the headline rate. Using the underlying rate&mdash;this is, as I said, the government's own preferred rate&mdash;as the true inflation rate, the fact is that Australia's real interest rates are just about the highest in the Western world. As I said, real short-term rates are the third highest in the Western world, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine. The real government bond yield, which is the rate which most influences our ongoing interest rate environment, is the second highest in the OECD area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. It cannot on the one hand claim that our real interest rates are in the middle of the OECD field and at the same time claim that our inflation is amongst the lowest in the OECD. To claim the former is to say that the true inflation rate is the headline rate. That is the only way he can justify his former statement. That is a fact that today Senator Cook, as I understand it, actually eschewed; he backed away from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to change its view on this point to accommodate the Prime Minister's interest rate assertion, then it has the acknowledge that far from Australia having a low inflation rate it in fact has the second highest inflation rate in the whole of the OECD, second only to Italy. I repeat: the government cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim that it has low inflation and that our real interest rate regime is in the middle of the pack. The two are fundamentally inconsistent. Yet the government has tried to mislead the Australian public for a long time now that we are doing well on the interest rate front and on the inflation rate front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even on the government's own manipulated figures, we are not doing that well on the interest rate front.

<PARA>In the context of his answer, the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, said that he would make no comment on the things I said about the appalling record of BHP at Ok Tedi Mine. It is a matter of regret that the minister is not prepared to make a comment. After all, BHP&mdash;the greatest Australian company, the Big Australian&mdash;is jeopardising our reputation as an environmentally sensitive and responsible corporate world citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the minister acknowledged that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation will attach environmental and other safeguarding conditions when it issues the insurance policies. However, the minister then said that, in general terms, it is no concern of this government what Australian companies are doing abroad; rather, it is the concern of the governments of those countries where the companies are operating. The implication was that the Australian government either has no power to intervene or no interest in intervening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly should have an interest in intervening. Also, it has been proved that it has the power to intervene. We have had at least two examples of that in recent times. We had the War Crimes Amendment Act 1988, which provided that people who committed wartime atrocities overseas could be tried and imprisoned in Australia. That act was upheld by the High Court in Polyukhovich v the Commonwealth. More recently we have had the child sex tourism legislation, which would have a similar effect for Australians who go overseas to sexually exploit young people. </PARA>

But let's make no mistake about it: if that voluntary code of conduct is either unsatisfactory or proves that Australian companies are prepared to ignore it, this parliament certainly has the powers to pass legislation to ensure that our corporate citizens behave overseas in a responsible manner. </PARA>

<PARA>There are a couple of points I want to make, and there is a pretty serious point I want to make on the assertions which were repeated in Senator Teague's question to the minister; that is, that those who were proclaimed to be refugees through the assessments that were undertaken in those camps gained their status by either bribing the people doing the assessments or giving sexual favours to the people doing the assessments. I do not believe and do not accept that that is the case. To the best of my knowledge, such assertions have not been made in that blunt way that I have put to the chamber. But that is the end result of the claims that are being made&mdash;and, indeed, have been made, as the minister said, for quite some period of time&mdash;about those who failed to get refugee status from the application in the various camps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has accepted 18,000 people as refugees from those camps. They are spread right across the South-East Asian region, and I have visited most of the camps that are still in place. Those people, I believe, were rightfully granted refugee status here in this country, and I think the vast majority of them are making very gainful contributions to Australia's life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must express some disappointment about the actions that are taking place in the United States Congress at the moment, actions, as I understand it, from a small number of individual congressmen&mdash;I am repeating the minister's words&mdash;which are giving false hope to people who are currently vegetating in the camps in South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Vegetating' has been a kind word for some of the camps and, as I said, I have visited most of them. In a place like Whitehead in Hong Kong, it is much worse than vegetating. In that concrete and razor-wire establishment known as Whitehead, the individuals are subject to quite a deal of violence. We have witnessed on our television screens in recent times in this country the riots that have taken place in the camps, where the forces of law and order have had to go in under the protection of tear gas to bring back order to the place. Quite a number of the detainees have been injured, and some people have even lost their lives in those conflicts. The guards who look after the camps have also been injured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the best will in the world, the congressmen who are pushing forward that bill in the United States Congress are giving those people in the camps, particularly in places like Whitehead, some false hope that they will be resettled in the United States or in some other part of the world. This is after these people have gone through independent assessment&mdash;in the case of Whitehead, by the Hong Kong authorities. It is all overseen by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, a body and establishment which I hold in the highest regard&mdash;which is not to say that we have not had some arguments during the Senate committee hearings on similar types of matters we have had to look into in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that those people have been given this false hope and that some 40,000 people continue to vegetate in places like Galang Island and Sungei Besi in Whitehead when they should be back in their homeland rebuilding their lives. Whilst one congressional report has been mentioned, another United States initiative with the aid organisations who visited Vietnam and many of the camps came down with a much more positive report than the one that has been mentioned today by Senator Teague in his question to the minister. </PARA>

<PARA>The minister's comments were nothing more than a pea and thimble trick, which we ought to become used to from this government in a number of areas. She talked about the community aged care places for older people as if they were additional aged care places, but they are not. I do not mind her getting up and saying what the government is doing but she really should tell the whole story&mdash;not half of it. That is what happened today in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's planning ratios of 100 nursing home, hostel and community aged care package places per 1,000 people aged over 70 have not increased. They have simply been rejigged. We have seen this happen in lots of other areas as well, and here it is happening again. People listening to question time on the radio or from up in the galleries would have thought that these were new places for older people to keep them out of institutions and at home. They are not new places. They are the ratios rejigged. They are simply places that have been taken from the nursing home and hostel sectors so that in the future there will be 40 nursing beds, 50 hostel beds and 10 community aged care packages per 1,000 of the population aged over 70. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are enormous problems in the aged care area. Many nursing homes are in a crisis situation because of a lack of adequate funding&mdash;just look at the planning ratios I just mentioned. These ratios need to be monitored carefully to ensure they are realistic and appropriate for Australia's ageing population. They were developed in the mid-1980s, when only 11 per cent of people aged 70 or over were over 85 years. By 2021, this figure will have increased to 16 per cent. So the supply of residential aged care places relative to the over-85 population will, in effect, decrease significantly over that period. It may be that the planning ratios will need to be adjusted in future to respond to changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley should have explained this in more detail when she answered that question. As I said, it appeared from what she said that these were new, you-beaut places. In fact, what we have is the same number of services for older people but in a different form. We are not saying that we should not have home and community care packages. There are some people who choose to be at home and who really need the level of care that you would get in residence at a nursing home, but they can stay at home with appropriate care. What we are saying, though, is that the government cannot have it both ways; it cannot pretend that this is something new. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem that we have seen with the rigid planning ratios is that they are based on regions and they do not allow or reflect regional differences. For example, an area which attracts a large number of retirees may well develop, over time, a disproportionate number of people over 85, and they are the group that have a greater demand on nursing home places. If there is a disproportionate number of people over 85 in an area, there will be a greater demand for aged care services in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these ratios and in the concepts behind them there is an assumption that, as a proportion of the old, old increases, the supply of carers will continue to meet the demand for care in the community. Whether one likes it or not, the home aged care package does place some demands on the carers, who are usually women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may not be the case that we have the same number of carers in the community that we have today. We have higher labour market participation rates of women. It is also the fact that potential carers will be older themselves. As more people live into that 85-year-old category, their daughters and sons will be older themselves and maybe not in a position to care for their ageing parents, in their 80s and 90s. We see increasing numbers of remarriages and divorces and that entails complications as to who is responsible for parents and step-parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go on about the shortfall in the funding required to upgrade nursing homes, which Professor Gregory outlined, or the government's failure to fund dementia-specific facilities&mdash;we have seen one close down in Melbourne just recently because the government has failed to subsidise that&mdash;or its continued failure to meet the needs of people with dementia for residential facilities.

<PARA>I just wish we had a minister for science who would put his brain into gear when he opened his mouth to start speaking. What we have is just words, words, words. We have economic diatribe as a substitute for real dialogue and discussion about where science is going in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) starts speaking about science, very quickly&mdash;within a sentence&mdash;he is talking about innovation, competition, economic growth, new industries and material advantage.

There is a vast difference, which the minister simply does not understand. That came out very clearly in that diatribe with which he went on today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at science as the basic and strategic foundation on which that innovation, competition and industrial development is based, one finds that Australia is in a declining position, not an improving position. We need to look, for instance, at the work that has been done over some years now in the Australian National University on the science citation index. This is a direct measure of the value scientists elsewhere in the world put on Australian science; that is, the number of times other scientists find the work done by Australian scientists worthy of being quoted when they do their own research work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What one finds is that, particularly since 1987, there has been a very significant decline in the relative rate of science citation for Australian scientific publications. These are publications in the proper, refereed scientific journals. This is not explained by claims that what we are doing is patenting more work&mdash;that work is not appearing in the journals but that the work is nonetheless being down&mdash;because when one looks at other countries, at Japan and the US, one sees that, despite the higher rate of patenting in those countries, their relative science citation rate has either been maintained or in fact is increased. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all Australians would probably now be aware, there is a debate up and running in this country as to the consequences on our interest rates of the level of our foreign debt. Some may regard this as a theoretical debate, something to be left to university professors. Like other economic arguments, such as the appropriate level of tariffs, the current account debate and the effect on employment of higher inflation, there are clearly a number of schools of thinking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the ordinary Australian in the street this debate may seem to be an inordinate waste of good time, energy and breath. Why then would the Prime Minister of this nation devote an entire three-quarters of a page in the middle of a national newspaper to argue that his critics are wrong and that he is right on this subject? Why is it that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has decided that convincing Australians that he is right on this academic argument is critical to the future well-being of Australia&mdash;more important than unemployment, our current account deficit or even the health of our nation's kids? Why does he need to go into print on this topic and no other?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one could cynically suggest that the Prime Minister has always been interested in this theoretical field and simply wants to demonstrate his standing. Perhaps he believes that there is merit in academic and theoretical truth, which warrants his intervention at this time. To suggest such propositions would require that one was not merely cynical but benignly stupid, given that the standing of the Prime Minister as an economic academic would be somewhere near absolute zero were it to be measured on a temperature scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Prime Minister Keating has used  Australia as his economic laboratory. He has experimented on the Australian people with his theories and predilections, but on this occasion academic righteousness is not, sadly, the motivating factor urging the Prime Minister. Instead we see again the actions and reactions of the political animal&mdash;caged, attacked and taunted by an honest and obvious truth that he knows can damage his career, his job and his political neck. So he reacts. First, the attack on those who dare confront him with this truth. Challenge their credibility, their motives and their integrity&mdash;anything but their arguments. Call them sour and spiteful, ridicule and mock&mdash;play the man, but never the ball. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, call forth your true supporters to muddy the waters, stir up the debate, develop convoluted red herrings&mdash;anything to distract attention from the truth. Finally, when all else fails, call in a favour or two. Take a spot in the national daily in a most prominent position, have your staff prepare a discourse and lecture one and all from the high altar of the Prime Minister's office. But whatever else happens, avoid the homely, uncontestable truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the truth that the Prime Minister wants so desperately to avoid? It can be summarised with three facts: firstly, since the election of the Labor government in 1983 Australia's foreign debt has increased from $23 billion to a massive $180 billion; secondly, since the takeover of the prime ministership by Paul Keating in December 1991, the Commonwealth's own purpose debt has increased a staggering $70 billion to approach $100 billion; and, thirdly, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank was so delighted to concede yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone should know that in economics everything is connected to everything else, so obviously in that sense debt has some connection with interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>Debt has some connection with interest rates. It is, in the words of the Prime Minister's mate the Governor of the Reserve Bank, obvious. It is certainly obvious to all those paying interest on their loans. It is obvious to every business that tries to raise funds to keep their business afloat. It is obvious to every householder who borrows money to fund a home extension, a holiday or even the purchase of the bare essentials. It is obvious to everyone except a Prime Minister and a Labor Party that does not want the people of Australia to reflect on who has made possible Australia's appalling debt situation. Who is it that has created the need for Australian companies, not to mention Australian governments, to borrow overseas? It is the man who claimed he pulled the levers of the Australian economy&mdash;the man who has run this nation for 12 years. Prime Minister Keating made the claim, so he must take the blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Labor Party senators opposite jump to their feet to recite the other words of wisdom from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, particularly his comments that those asserting a link between foreign debt and short-term interest rates were drawing a long bow, allow me to develop the question of the link a little further. On 30 March this year, in a speech to business economists, the governor said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So long as we remain so dependent on foreign savings, for which we must compete in international capital markets, we remain vulnerable to adverse swings in market sentiment.</PARA>
<PARA>Further he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most obvious vulnerability is our exposure to a sharply falling exchange rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Downward pressure on the exchange rate, if it were to persist, would add to inflationary pressures and force the authorities into tough policy measures.</PARA>
<PARA>For those Labor senators opposite whose only understanding of economics is obtained by watching re-runs of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The New Price is Right</EMPHASIS>, I will explain it in simple language. The Keating Labor government has been chalking up debts for Australia&mdash;up to $70 billion over the past three years alone. To  borrow that money it has gone into both the domestic market and, to a limited degree, the foreign market. When the federal government borrows money in Australia, it makes it harder for others to borrow in this country. As a consequence, the private sector and state governments look overseas to borrow money for investment purposes. That, in turn, pushes up our foreign debt, the amount we owe to the rest of the world. As the debt gets bigger, the greater is our risk. Companies can go broke and even states under Labor administrations can go close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To cover the increased risk, the money lenders impose a premium on our borrowings. They do not trust us quite as much as they used to. Consequently, everyone who borrows money overseas pays a little more. Why is it that 10-year bond rates here in Australia incur a premium price, a risk premium of two per cent, or 200 basis points, over that in the USA or even a risk premium of 150 basis points, or 1.5 per cent, over our neighbouring New Zealand? In addition, just because we have to borrow overseas, we are made vulnerable to changes in market sentiment. If US interest rates go up and investors move their money out of Australia, our exchange rate is affected. This has a consequence for our inflation rate and, as the authorities take tough policy action, our interest rates are affected. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said, `everything in economics is affected by everything else'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why is the Labor government having to borrow so much in the domestic market? Why does our federal government owe $100 billion? Because the Prime Minister would rather buy votes and curry favours than live within his means. The Labor government have stolen, mortgaged, put in hock and gambled the future of our nation for the sake of short-term political appeal. They have sucked taxes from the pockets not only of today's workers, but of the children of those workers and their children too. They have decimated household savings and they are the main culprit for the lack of public savings. Now, as we approach another federal election, they want the public of Australia to believe that everything is okay. They want you to believe that there is only one way of running the country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to finally nail this lie which the opposition continues to put up that home mortgage payers are hostage to our foreign debt. In fact, yesterday afternoon I had cause to come through the chamber when Senator Short was speaking. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that I am not surprised that Senator Wheelwright&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is in debate last night&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not seem to be included in Labor's batting team for this one. Unless things have changed, given his appalling performance last week, I was not at all surprised to see him dropped&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately for Senator Short, I am back and I am opening the batting for our side. It is a great pleasure to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my remarks last week I said something which I probably have to apologise for. I said initially that senators opposite either did not understand the relationship between foreign debt and home mortgage rates or they were deliberately trying to deceive the Australian public. I have to apologise for the latter part of my remarks. It does not seem that they are trying to deliberately deceive the public. It seems that they genuinely do not have anybody on their side who has ever had to construct a home mortgage rate or understands how it is done. I go back to the statements which I made last week, and I will repeat them for the benefit of the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the home mortgage rate was deregulated by this government as part of its deregulation of the financial markets, the home mortgage interest rate has been determined by the cash rate plus a margin.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the sort of evidence which the other side has been dependent upon, I can go to no better authority than Dr Vince FitzGerald. Having had time over the weekend to reflect upon the debate and consider his own remarks, Dr FitzGerald came out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper and sought to clarify exactly what he had said. His article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Variable mortgage rates are more influenced by short-term market rates, which in turn move mainly in response to the actions of the monetary authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only is that exactly what I said in the Senate last week but it is almost exactly the same words. Just for the sake of clarifying the situation for senators opposite, I will read what else he said in the article. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The premium is, without doubt, substantially priced into fixed mortgage rates because the funding of these relates directly to the bond market.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, that is true, except there are no fixed mortgage rates in this country. Senator Gibson, you cannot, as you do in the United States, get a mortgage which will be fixed for 30 years. The reason for that is that we do not have the depth in the corporate bond market in this country that they do in the United States. If you were in the United States, you could say that foreign debt was related to home mortgage rates, but you cannot say it in this country because it is simply not true. The banks borrow short and lend long. Their short-term rates are where they get their funds from, and their funds base determines the rate that they charge on the mortgage&mdash;and that changes. Because it changes, there is no need to put in a risk premium. Therefore, there is no relationship between foreign debt and home mortgage rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to stress this, because it is a source of concern to the average Australian. They listen to parliament and read the newspapers. Unfortunately, they read ill-informed remarks by some journalists in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, but they have quite natural concerns about their mortgages. The fact of the matter is that there is no relationship and there cannot be a relationship between foreign debt and home mortgage rates, and everything that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) have said is absolutely true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my original point. The fact that there is nobody on the other side who understands the relationship between foreign debt and home mortgage rates is indeed a source of serious concern. I do not think we can take to task Senator Short. He does his best in this place, I am sure, although I do not believe he has ever been in the financial markets. He has been a long way from economics. But you cannot criticise the apprentice; you have to criticise the sorcerer. The person who is really the source of all of these remarks&mdash;these ill-informed remarks which needlessly upset average working Australians&mdash;is Mr Costello, the shadow Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes as no surprise to me that there is concern on the other side of this chamber with the performance of Mr Costello, because that has been said to me by members of the press gallery. All Mr Costello does is trot out one-liners. He has no fundamental understanding of the economy and no fundamental understanding of economic policy. That is why we get these mis-statements and distortions bandied about in public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to the ABC, because I have in front of me an extract from a doorstop interview which was broadcast on the ABC on 30 August 1995. I think it is a particularly useful example of exactly how Mr Costello operates. The reporter is identified here as Eastley, but I think this reporter probably deserves a Walkley for this performance. Listen to Mr Costello's remark about the foreign debt. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . $180 billion, that's $10,000 for each man, woman and child. It represents in human terms, if you break it down for each person, $10,000 worth of debt that Australians. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The reporter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But they haven't incurred that debt and they don't have to pay it back.</PARA>
<PARA>Costello bats on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you break it down, if you want to try and humanise the figures of what $180 billion means, the amount that Australia owes overseas, it means in population terms, $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The reporter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it's a dishonest analogy, because they don't owe that money.</PARA>
<PARA>Costello says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm trying to explain to you the size of the sum, do you know what $180 billion is, $180 billion is $10,000. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The reporter replies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it's not owed by individual Australians. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Costello still has not got the hint. He is still batting on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$180 billion is $10,000&mdash;that's what it represents. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The reporter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you could equally say it represents you know, $10 for every potato in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the point&mdash;you can always divide one number by another and get a third number. What is it going to be&mdash;5c for every matchstick? It is absolutely ridiculous to reduce the economic debate in this country to this sort of piffle. All it is, is a series of stand-up comedian lines. There is no understanding and no attempt to further this country economically. It is simply an attempt to get the headlines with a two-minute grab and say absolutely nothing about economics in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can refer briefly to this lengthy article in the press today by the Prime Minister. It amply demonstrates in calm and rational terms, which can be examined and appreciated by anybody, exactly our foreign debt position and the benefit that that brings to this country. I cannot go through all of these remarks, but I would certainly like to highlight some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points the Prime Minister makes is that we have been in a position of borrowing from overseas since 1788, and it is quite true. Senator Gibson might like to know the difference between debt and equity. Senator Gibson only talks about the rise in foreign debt since 1983. He does not seem to have heard of net foreign indebtedness. He does not seem to appreciate that there are two sorts of foreign finance for economic growth within this country&mdash;equity and debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what has changed since we deregulated the financial system is that we are now incurring debt rather than equity. We are not selling off the farm any more; we are borrowing against our assets, and we can well afford to pay for them, as the Prime Minister has said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1980s, around 20 per cent of our export proceeds were set aside to service our debt. Today, that figure is 11 per cent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we can service our debt. The average Australian understands what debt is. The average Australian has borrowed to buy a house. The average Australian knows that he or she can afford to pay a certain amount, carry that debt and have the present benefit of that asset. That is exactly what Australians are doing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question, which is never addressed by senators opposite because they do not have any policy and refuse to provide some, is whether we can improve the savings performance of this country. That is the way to deal with foreign debt. That is the only way to deal with foreign debt. Dr FitzGerald said that in his report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done the two things that Dr FitzGerald recommended: firstly, we have maintained the superannuation guarantee charge&mdash;and those superannuation dollars will provide the savings for future investment by Australians; and, secondly, we have turned around the fiscal situation at the Commonwealth level from deficit to surplus. We have done the two immediate things which were recommended by that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the sorts of things that are going to advance this country and advance the level of economic debate. But look at what we have from the other side. We have what I would regard as the politics of cynicism, the politics of the smart alec, the cheap politics of saying, `We had a plan once. John Hewson had a plan. It was well worked out&mdash;everybody could have a look at it, everybody could understand it, everybody could debate it.' Unfortunately, the electorate looked at it and said, `Thank you very much, but we don't like it. We're not going to vote for it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the response from senators opposite? `We won't talk about policy any more. We'll run and hide. We'll deceive the public. We'll never show our colours again. We'll never come into the marketplace with ideas. We'll never come out and say, "Here, this is our future. This is what we present to the Australian people." No, no, no. It's far too dangerous, far too risky to do that. We'll try and play it smart. We won't have any policy at all. We'll try and roll up in a ball and see if nobody can kick us.' That is not going to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at some of the things they have done. The Western Australian royal commission&mdash;what a cynical exercise. That has blown up in their faces. This debt truck&mdash;what a joke of an idea that is. I am reliably informed by my colleague the member for Calare (Mr Simmons) that at 1.45 this afternoon, it was seen on Mount Victoria under tow with a green tarpaulin over it. What a delicious irony. That cheap sort of politics will not work and never will work. Until senators opposite get a policy, they will never get the respect of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am. I have just updated them a little bit, Senator Ray. As I said yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was wrong to deny that there is any link between interest rates and foreign debt. He himself has connected the two in some of his more salient moments in the past. As I also said yesterday, I think the coalition stands equally guilty of misrepresentation for trying to talk up the size of our foreign debt problem, a problem which savings expert Dr Vince FitzGerald notes is `not unmanageable'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous speaker, Senator Wheelwright, has said, Australia has been in debt to foreigners for all of its 207 years of white settlement. In fact, our foreign debt as a percentage of GDP is lower now than it was five years ago&mdash;thank goodness for that!&mdash;and the proportion of our export income needed to service the debt is lower now than it was five years ago. But we do still need to address our chronic national savings problem. We do need to address our chronic current account deficits, which are evidence of this national savings problem and which are year by year adding to our debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key variable driving our current account deficit is not so much the cyclical trade balance, but the underlying income deficit; that is, the interest we are paying on our foreign debt and the profits we have to repatriate to foreign investors. That is the reason we think that our current account deficit will not be brought under control, even as our trade performance improves. It is not good enough to keep offering that to us as a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a capital importing country, we need to be able to continue to attract both lenders and investors. The net foreign debt figures focused on in yesterday's debate and today's debate tell only half the story, in our view. Our foreign debt has stabilised since 1989, largely because of the dramatic increase in foreign equity liabilities. This government has promoted a massive debt for equity swap. Senator Wheelwright said that we are not selling off the farm, but over the past decade the level of foreign investment in Australia has risen from 16 per cent of GDP to over 36 per cent&mdash;that is in one decade&mdash;and it is still rising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign equity investment is much more expensive to service than foreign debt. I have been pointing that out for about six years now, and I think some of the predictions that we have made over that time are coming to reality. According to the Bureau of Statistics, Australia's net foreign debt liabilities stand at about 16 per cent of GDP, but net foreign debt liabilities stand at about 39 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we manage the cost? Everybody asks if it is manageable or not. For every $1 we pay overseas in interest on the debt, we are now paying 80c in profits to foreigners on the equity investments. It is a very small gap, as I said yesterday&mdash;$1 and 80c. That means that foreign investment is more than twice as expensive as foreign debt. That, to us, is a very key point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do not want to talk about foreign investment policy in this country because, despite the one Senate committee which has looked at general policy parameters as they apply to the Foreign Investment Review Board, over the past decade neither of the major parties has really been willing to address the little oversight that the Foreign Investment Review Board provides to key foreign investment decisions. There is now no test of whether an investment will provide a net economic benefit to Australia. There is now no opportunities test of whether a comparable Australian bidder is available. There is no transparency in decision making. There is no government response to the Senate print media inquiry report handed down nearly five months ago. </PARA>

Again, we do not think there is any question that there is a linkage between foreign debt, the current account and interest rates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994-95 the government and the Reserve Bank have taken a different approach to what we saw in the 1980s, where we saw high interest rates used to slow down the economy. In 1994-95, the government and the Reserve Bank have been able to bring growth back without sending the economy into recession, but again interest rates were used to quell excessive demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Dr Frank Gelber from BIS Shrapnel recently pointed out, if the expected sharp improvement in the current account does not arrive and if the ACTU keeps on delivering wage increases to its members in excess of 45 per cent, it means an almost certain rise in interest rates next year. But I would like to argue that we can avoid all of this scaremongering about interest rates by embracing sensible policy decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government could avoid the need for a rise in interest rates in several ways.

Thirdly, it could reform the taxation system and financial system regulations to better encourage voluntary savings and to discourage debt creation of purely consumption or speculation purposes. Fourthly, it should dramatically overhaul our trade and industry policies to encourage a sectoral planning approach to maximising export and import replacement performance by industry.

We are adding $26 billion to that debt every year. We have had over $2 billion debt in 12 of the last 13 months. We are adding another $27 billion this year.

That is the real interest rate which Australians are paying for their money as a result of this government's policies. Even the Labor Party would understand that interest rates at a very high level are bad for people. They are bad for people purchasing homes, bad for businesses, bad in my state for the car industry. Lease a car now and see what sort of interest rate you pay. The same applies for people buying a car. That particularly affects my state, which has the most struggling economy in Australia. It is bad for exporters. It is bad for job seekers. High interest rates are bad. As I say, even the government would accept that. </PARA>

It is a ridiculous proposition. It begs the question: if the Treasurer is right, why are interest rates in this country so high? Why are we paying amongst the highest real interest rates in the world, if it is not the foreign debt? The government cannot explain that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) this morning, which Senator Wheelwright referred to, was laughable as well.

It has trebled since 1990, which is about the time that this man, Mr Keating, became Prime Minister. The debt has increased by something like $70,000 million.</PARA></TALK.START>

Even after they fiddled the books with asset sales, calling them reductions in outlays, we still ran deficits for eight of the 12 budgets of this government. We are paying $10,000 million every year in interest on the government's own debt. We spend as much on interest payments on your debt as we spend on defending this country. It is a disgrace.

There is insufficient savings in Australia to fund public and private sector borrowings. That is forcing people offshore and forcing the debt up. Your own savings adviser, Dr FitzGerald, said it all.

But that is probably a debate for another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responding to Senator Cooney's learned comments on whether or not individual Australians actually owe a certain amount, I would like to take the comments of Laura Tingle as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 23 September. She said that we might not be individually responsible, but we get to pay the bills. I think that is putting this whole argument at a very basic level. We get to pay the bills via the fact that there are more people wanting to borrow money in Australia than there are people with money to lend. That is why we now owe such an enormous amount on foreign currency markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a domestic level, home buyers and owners are faced with massive uncertainty and unnecessarily high interest rates as a result of this money supply imbalance which is a result of this government's financial mismanagement. New home owners are feeling the brunt of high real mortgage rates. Together, rising or static home prices and rising interest rates have combined to make first homes less affordable. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine recently showed that Australia's bank prime interest rates are the highest among the 15 major industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, the Prime Minister's personal attitude to the economic worries of the average voters is worth noting. He is completely oblivious to the problems that people on the ground are facing. He is ensconced here in Canberra in the interest free home, the Lodge, and in his $2 million house in Woollahra in Sydney and has no concept whatever of how hard it is for the average home buyer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's rhetoric&mdash;`Voters have never had it so good' and `What are they complaining about?'&mdash;belies his total disdain for the rest of the country. Median house prices compiled by the Real Estate Institute of Australia show that house prices have remained static since the rises in interest rates began last year. This has happened simultaneously with home buyers suffering from comparatively high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After enduring the `recession we had to have', home buyers are uncertain and frightened about their economic futures. The latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey finds that households are becoming more pessimistic about both the immediate and long-term economic outlook. Those who have bought houses and are feeling the pain of high interest rates are being told by the Prime Minister to save more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article quoted the Prime Minister's address to the Collingwood Football Club, in which he had the hypocritical audacity to talk about the necessity of savings. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We inculcated a whole generation of Australians: buy a flat, buy a beach house, buy anything but basically don't save.</PARA>
<PARA>However, as Mr Bernie Fraser&mdash;who seems to feature in economic pronouncements these days&mdash;said in a speech to Australian business economists in March this year:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words used by Tom Valentine, the Dean of Commerce at the University of Western Sydney, have already been used by Senator Minchin and illustrate this argument very well. I suspect the Prime Minister knows it too. I quote again from Laura Tingle's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 23 September, where she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the height of the interest rate pain in 1989, Keating justified using high interest rates because they had the benefit of sharing the pain of attacking Australia's trade and debt problems, which spending cuts did not . . . `Monetary policy gives you a reduction [in living standards] across the board so the yuppies are paying too!' he said.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Prime Minister gloating over the pain that his government has caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians at every level are experiencing painful financial times because the Prime Minister is running that sort of economic debate. The fact remains that if we continue to choose to grow at a rate faster than we can finance&mdash;that is ultimately a decision for the government of the day&mdash;we have to borrow more to do it. The Prime Minister should look at his own record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what of the future? The present import figures and the disconcerting outlook on inflation, as outlined by my colleagues in the very knowledgeable economic argument they have run, mean that we are left with possibly more of the same in the future. There is no relief in sight. The ultimate indictment of this government is that they have disastrously mismanaged the economy, we have massive foreign and domestic debt, and we are now paying unnecessarily high interest rates. As quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 23 September, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday we debated debt and interest rates. Today we are debating debt and interest rates, this time in relation to housing.

It hasn't.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, we also said that the compulsory superannuation scheme to increase savings is not an answer to our current account deficit problem, even if it could be made more equitable than the government intends. Today the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reports that the Reserve Bank agrees with us. But the focus of this debate seems to be the impact of interest rates on house mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When interest rates went up earlier this year we pointed out that this would increase the cost of mortgages, reducing family disposable income. Among other things, this reduces family savings and is therefore counterproductive. It may increase bank profits but such profits are driving expansion of banks with the purchase or establishment of banks in the United States, Indonesia and other countries. It is part of the flight of capital from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also mentioned that increased interest rates were likely to raise costs for small business in a variety of ways at a time when they had little option to increase prices. That will probably be the subject of an MPI later this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increases in interest rates often affect home mortgages. Servicing the average mortgage is the single most significant monthly expenditure for most people. Home mortgage servicing costs are often 50 per cent or more of a family's weekly post-tax earnings, and a change of a few per cent can have significant impact on disposable income remaining after the mortgage is paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing for many people is that the value of their homes are currently declining while interest rates are rising. People are in the invidious position where, if they sell their home, they have less money than when they began, and many are even in debt after their home sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our urban planning and housing policies affect prices. In boom times in the housing market or when government proposes to freeze land releases or building approvals, as the ACT government has just done, home prices rise in a way unrelated to underlying values. Foreign house purchases also introduce factors external to our economy, which is why you can have a boom cycle and lower housing prices or a huge increase in prices when there is not much happening in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The urban planning issues can be seen where areas of decreasing home values are generally in the poorer, usually outlying, suburbs. Trendy inner city house prices continue to rise. This is the impact of the inability to buy due to low wage levels, coupled with urban planning that makes these areas undesirable. Old inner city working-class areas, with their proximity to services and low transport needs, are the new abode of the diminishing middle class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dispersed areas of public housing, semi-public housing and cheap housing continue to generate negative equity. The areas are expensive to live in, although they are cheaper to buy. It is mainly initial low cost and the existence of public sector loan assistance that drives the poorer people to buy in these areas. Their purchase often has more to do with waiting lists and availability of loans than the state of the market, so they can get caught out. Efforts to raise prices by freezing development simply distort prices and further reduce the market, since it becomes more difficult for people wanting to buy as residents to purchase a home. It must be seen that there are elements, as I have mentioned before, in our housing markets which impact on people's payments much more than interest rates, though interest rates are important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to the chamber that the Australian Democrats will be supporting this second-best amendment. I draw the chamber's attention to the debate when we had before us both this amendment and the amendment that was defeated last night by the combined vote of the government and the opposition. The Democrats indicated then that the best option would have been to have supported both amendments because they do not cover the same group of people, as the opposition has now learned. Those amendments cover two different groups of people, and we would have had the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, the opposition could not see its way clear to supporting our amendment. I am disappointed about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment today on something Senator Hill said last night which is relevant to this debate, and that is his plea that the Democrats should give the government a serve and not pick on the Liberal Party all the time. I wanted to respond to that by saying that last night we were indeed picking on the Liberal Party and making an appeal to the National Party, because we were able to distinguish between the two in terms of their real commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Hill that the government needs just as big a stick applied to it as he felt we were applying to the Liberal Party because the government has, as Senator Hill indicated, turned down on every occasion the opportunity to help Australian kids within farming families and within country areas to get the kind of justice and education they need to equip them for the kind of future which we all believe young people in Australia ought to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Hill that, if I were a little harsh in my criticism of the opposition, that criticism certainly goes to the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to support Senator Hill's amendment. The rural community, primary industry and their families owe a great deal of thanks to you, Senator Hill, for running with this amendment. As for it being a second-best amendment, there is a lot to be said for both amendments. The amendment that we have moved does not distinguish between farm families and small business that are affected by the drought. People out there are all in the same boat, or the same town, together. If primary industry and the farmers are doing it tough, that will be reflected on the business community that are also suffering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that Senator Hill has put forward to the committee will pick up the small business people in the towns who would, I believe, have a negative income or a very minor income at the moment. They are suffering equally as hard as the people on the farm. There is a lot to be said for our amendment, and I am very glad that it is going to go through. I see Senator Margetts is in the chamber. I feel sure that she is going to support this amendment. The government will be defeated, as they rightly should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this chamber on a number of occasions that every child in Australia deserves the right to participate in education. Many children in rural Australia at the moment are being tricked out of a tertiary education because the assets of their parents are worth over $750,000. Many primary industry properties&mdash;properties, farms, grazing properties&mdash;have assets worth over $750,000 but have not had an income for the last four or five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been picked up, and I concede that has been picked up, in the drought relief package that has been released and has benefited most Queenslanders, many farmers from New South Wales, although not all, very few from Victoria but none from South Australia. There are a huge number of people there who literally cannot afford to send their children to school or to tertiary education. Either amendment&mdash;the Woodley amendment or the Hill amendment&mdash;will be able to facilitate an education for the sons and daughters of Australian farmers. So we are really splitting hairs over the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley has contacted, either by ringing or writing, most primary industry representatives, such as the Cattlemen's Union, the UGA and the sugar industry, asking them to lend support to his amendment. I have received representations from all those people, and I have rung back most of them and said that this health care card amendment will do the job. They have been grateful and, in a lot of cases, they have said that it will do the job. In most cases they say, `We are very grateful that we will be able to get that. As long as you will hold the line and the Senate will hold the line on that health care card, we are happy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill's point yesterday was a very good point: we have to make the government stick to this amendment. On four occasions the minister has allowed papers and documentation&mdash;they may not have been from the minister and they may not have been in the budget papers, but DEET is a government department and the minister is responsible for his department&mdash;to go out that have built up expectations amongst country children that they could access tertiary education if their parents' income was under $20,000 only to have it cruelly snatched away two or three months later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government that should get the stick on this piece of legislation. It is the government that has rejected tertiary education for many children. I am very grateful that Senator Hill has moved this amendment. I know that everyone in the Senate, apart from the Labor Party, which, for some reason, hates farmers, is going to support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will do my best. The majority of health care card recipients are families who are assets tested to be eligible for Commonwealth benefits, such as jobsearch or additional family payments. The majority of health care card recipients are already assets tested. The health care card is also, though, issued to some low income earners who do not need to meet an assets test. That is a relatively small group, and it is, in particular, to make sure that people who have a low income are assisted for the purposes of the benefits of the health care card. They are a much smaller group than the health care card assets tested recipients, but not so small as to mean that if this amendment passes there will not be a cost to government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that that cost to government, if all health care card recipients become eligible, would be some $10 million or more. It is true that some of the people who are eligible for a health care card as low income people are those who have actually arranged their finances and so on to be asset rich and income poor. So the concern is to make sure that, while they are assisted as low income people for the benefits of a health care card, they are not also further benefited under this legislation for Austudy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That interjection from Senator Hill probably does deserve a comment. Am I suggesting they are farmers? No. I am not making any suggestion about who they are. There are certainly examples of people from a number of quarters who are able to arrange their assets and incomes so as to be beneficiaries of this sort, but it is not a question of debating this at length. We have been through it. I think this was canvassed very extensively yesterday.

My making the comments on both schedules together will save some time. My brief comments relate to schedules 3 and 4 as they both relate to the way in which the department will treat compensation payments received by youth training allowance recipients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, for ease of administration the department assumes that where any loss of income component can be identified in a compensation payment, 50 per cent of that payment has been made for loss of income. The department then divides this amount by average weekly earnings to calculate the number of weeks a person is precluded from their payment. I have said before in this place that I do not fully support the use of this 50 per cent rule. The impact of this rule on a person who only receives 25 per cent of his or her compensation payment for economic loss, and the rest to cover medical expenses, must be devastating. </PARA>

In other words, the course must be an approved one and, to be eligible for the training supplement, the person must obtain approval to undertake that course. As I said in a previous debate, around 50 per cent of successful jobsearch is undertaken independent of the CES. As such, the Democrats believe we should be rewarding people's initiative rather than enforcing dependence on the CES.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2), which proposes a range of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. These proposals are largely non-controversial. Mr Acting Deputy President Herron, it is apt that you are in the chair because the main purpose of this bill is to remove customs duty from all imports of tobacco leaf, unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco products. At present, excise is payable on locally manufactured tobacco products and it is based on the weight of the product. There is another bill coming forward which will result in excise duty being applied to manufactured tobacco products from overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report No. 39, which reported into the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries, advised that the tobacco products industry existed in an artificial environment created by the protectionist measures of the tobacco industry stabilisation program and the local leaf content scheme. These economic buffer instruments have distorted the industry by insulating it from the dynamics of international tobacco trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, one has to cast one's mind back 20 or 30 years when there was a very good reason for the implementation of these schemes. In those days, tobacco smoking was not on the nose&mdash;if you can excuse the pun. In fact, 20 or 30 years ago it was considered to be a very socially acceptable habit. As a result of that, there was concern among governments of the day about the increase in the volume of imports of manufactured tobacco products. The government then moved to encourage growers to develop tobacco plants in Australia so that our balance of payments would not be adversely affected with the passage of time. However, times do change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report prompted a government response. On 13 November 1994, the government announced a tobacco industry restructuring package. The package was generally accepted by the tobacco industry. There were some complaints from pockets within the industry, but it was generally accepted&mdash;certainly in my own state of Queensland and also by the cigarette manufacturers. It constituted a deal between the industry, the state governments and the manufacturers, as I mentioned. Out of this negotiation, the cigarette manufacturers are to make a contribution of $10.8 million to the tobacco growing industry. Each of the tobacco growing states&mdash;Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales&mdash;is contributing $5.8 million, $850,000 and $3 million respectively to restructure the industry. This contribution will match the assistance of the cigarette manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian cigarette manufacturers will establish long-term contracts commercially negotiated between themselves and the individual local growers. The Commonwealth and the three tobacco producing states will not oppose any new or additional taxes on tobacco products. The Commonwealth will introduce an ad valorem 25 per cent tariff to be phased out in accordance with the World Trade Organisation agreement on all imports of tobacco leaf to establish a suitable adjustment period for growers of tobacco to evolve into the open international market. The quid pro quo for these contributions would be the removal of the protectionist instruments mentioned earlier, thus exposing the growers to international competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The termination of the local leaf content scheme and the tobacco industry stabilisation program, along with the introduction of the commission's other proposals, is in accordance with Australia's obligations under the Uruguay Round agricultural package, which decrees that all signatories convert all non-tariff trade barriers to tariff only assistance in order that all trade barriers are transparent to international scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review of the Australian Customs Service acknowledged the apparent anomaly argued by the Australian Medical Association between the government's policies of discouraging smoking and the government exempting tobacco products from duty. The Industry Commission report on the tobacco industry argues that, by removing trade barriers such as the local leaf content scheme and the tobacco industry stabilisation program in conjunction with the phasing out of tariff only assistance in accordance with the Uruguay Round agreements, the domestic tobacco industry would contract following exposure to the competition on the international tobacco market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment to remove the duty is a sound measure. It is one that was worked out well with the industry. It implements a successful negotiation between the industry and the state governments. It is a program designed to make our industry more competitive and our long-term use of government revenue more efficient. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The bill makes a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The first major measure, set out in clause 4 of the bill, will provide for the duty-free entry of certified reference materials. Reference materials are compounds with accurately known compositions which are used as a standard against which similar materials and processes can be compared and apparatus calibrated. By providing for the duty-free importation of certified reference materials, the amendment will allow for their wider use in industry and will provide cheaper inputs for the manufacturing sector. The Democrats will be supporting this part of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure is a response to a recent AAT decision that determined that blankets containing viscose rayon in quantities varying from 81 per cent to 94 per cent were wholly of viscose. This had the effect of reducing the intended industry assistance rate from 27 per cent to nil. These amendments redefine the description of certain subheadings by replacing the word `wholly' with `of 100 per cent'. This will reinstate the intended level of assistance to the subject goods and corrects what appears to have been a drafting error in the original bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third measure in the bill intends to make imports of unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco products free of customs duties from 1 January 1995. This action is a response to an Industry Commission report into the tobacco industry entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The tobacco growing and manufacturing industry</EMPHASIS>. The existing provisions are said to be against the rules of the World Trade Organisation as they require importers of unmanufactured tobacco to blend a certain amount of Australian tobacco with the imported tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, aside from the fact that the Australian government is moving to drop a 50 per cent local content requirement at a time when the United States government is believed to be attempting to introduce regulations requiring 75 per cent local content for domestic and export tobacco products, the fact remains that the bill aims to reduce tax on a product that has contributed to the deaths of tens of thousands of Australians. The Democrats certainly do not support this reduction of taxation on tobacco and will be voting against this part of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final part of the bill deals with the duty payable on automatic regulating or controlling instruments and apparatus. Schedule 2 of the bill will insert new general provisions that will have the effect of distinguishing between such goods used as replacement components in passenger vehicles and those used in other ways. This amendment provides a new tariff subheading to allow parts for regulating and controlling instruments which are not of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles to retain the duty phase down to five per cent by 1 July 1996. The Democrats will not be opposing this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I was not able to reach the chamber by the end of the second reading debate to deliver the speech that I was scheduled to give, so I would like to make a very brief statement at the third reading stage. I understand that the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 will be passed. I support Senator Spindler in the Democrats' opposition to the part of the bill that refers to tobacco.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wish to make a brief statement about the Greens' position. We believe that the bill that is about to be passed will make the cost of imported, unmanufactured tobacco cheaper by eliminating the tariff. This is in line with the whole GATT-World Trade Organisation process in which the subsidies and protection for the Australian tobacco industry are being eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry Commission report No. 34 of 1994 provided an opportunity for the Senate to look at and speak about the elimination of subsidies and protection to the Australian tobacco industry. The Greens did not oppose the elimination of support for the tobacco industry, but we were concerned about the Industry Commission's schemes to cut duties on the import of manufactured tobacco and to change the tariff from one based on weight to one based on ad valorem. The reasons for our objection were the same as those from health groups&mdash;that it could result in real reduction in tobacco prices and create a major potential difference between expensive and cheap cigarettes, while the weight-based system tends to reduce the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill cuts the tariff on unmanufactured tobacco only. This is unlikely to affect the cost of tobacco products. Unmanufactured tobacco is a minor economic input to cigarettes. The excise will continue to apply and, between the excise and the other inputs to manufactured tobacco products, the price is likely to be unchanged. Even so, the elimination of the duties will have the effect of reducing government revenue by an expected $4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we are no friends of GATT, we do not mind seeing the demise of the Australian tobacco industry. Tobacco production is pesticide intensive, damaging the water table and river systems. There are better things for Australian farmers to produce than recreational drugs that damage people's health without even creating the illusion of well-being. I understand that there are already adjustment programs in place for producers. We believe that the whole issue of bringing into the country tobacco from other countries will have unforeseen consequences. It is for that reason that we want to express at this point our grave reservations about the tobacco industry and, even in the face of this bill going through, what impact that is likely to have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Senator Chamarette provoked me in a similar way. This is part of a package of agreed measures with the industry, which has seen the phase-out of a number of mechanisms that have been traditionally attached to the industry, including the stabilisation plan and a local relief content scheme. There are a number of quid pro quos in this package. Manufacturers are providing funding of $10.8 million for industry restructuring. The Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee is being wound up and its assets are being transferred to the Tobacco Research and Development Council, which is in the process of being established.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, my office has indicated to the government, the Greens and the Democrats that we propose one simple amendment&mdash;although I suppose nothing is simple in relation to this bill. But what the amendment seeks to achieve is simple. We agree that lessening the load on those companies that would now be classified as small is a worthwhile experiment&mdash;perhaps it can be called an experiment. A reduction of the burden on small business must be welcomed, and an opportunity to put that to the test is being presented by this legislation. This notion underpins the government's small/large distinction, which is that large companies should have a greater burden than small companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until the end of the last sittings, we were of the view that the government's formula was perhaps right. Subsequent to those sittings, we have had the opportunity to rethink and consult more people. While we agree that a more useful way to look at requirements of reporting and requirements of corporate governance is whether a company is small or large, we do not agree that the standard for large companies needs to be higher than the existing standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, we accept a small/large distinction, but we simply say this: `We will accept the standard that you offer for the small companies but, with respect to the large companies, we think they could stay the same.' That would leave small companies with a lesser burden and large companies with a higher burden. All we are talking about now is what the burden for the larger companies should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes some differentiation across those companies that would be classified as large, with one exception. That is, the government is now saying that those companies which were in existence in 1994 and which chose to have an auditor&mdash;remembering of course that those companies had a choice to either have an auditor or file key financial data&mdash;will be allowed to continue to have an auditor, provided they meet the other requirements of an exempt proprietary company, and they will not have to file financial statements. In other words, they can be quarantined with the choice that they made at the time to have an auditor. All those companies which did not make that choice and which chose only to file key financial data, as well as any subsequent companies that fall into the large basket, would have to have not only an auditor but also higher reporting requirements&mdash;that is, they would have to file financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not true to say that the government's proposal completely streamlines reporting for those companies that would be classified as large. It does not. It sets aside those companies which made what the government perceives to be the appropriate choice and appointed an auditor. For a number of reasons which the government might care to elaborate on, it believes that they can stay as they are and they will not have this higher filing of financial statements. So there is that differentiation within the government's proposal to deal with large, exempt proprietary companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asking the government to rethink this and put on a fresh set of glasses&mdash;which will actually be the old set of glasses it had on before it went into the simplification program&mdash;and say to itself, `For small companies, the lower requirements are appropriate and, for large companies, there should be a higher requirement.' But the higher requirement should be the requirement that existed before&mdash;to either have an auditor or file key financial data. That would simplify the reporting process such that we could say that all current exempt proprietary companies and those that fell into that category would have the same reporting requirements. We would not need this quarantining and grandfathering of those companies which chose to have an auditor prior to 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that is the appropriate path to take. We are not convinced that there is adequate evidence to say that requiring an auditor in these large companies will save numerous companies from falling over. One could go back into the dark history of the 1980s and point to numerous occasions where auditors were in place and there was no saving against any bad faith or malfeasance on behalf of directors and there was no saving against management's stupidity vis-a-vis investments. Many auditors are now looking down the barrel of being sued because it has not turned out to be as effective as so many people hoped it would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that to indicate that we believe auditing is a useless process; clearly, it is not a useless process. But it is not the be-all and end-all either. On that basis we say, `Why don't we stick with the existing arrangement and allow those companies that are prudent&mdash;' in my view `&mdash;vis-a-vis their own assets to choose?' Certainly, if I had $10 million in turnover going through a company in which I had a shareholding, I would want an auditor if only to make sure that the management who come in and perhaps have no interest are not creaming off some of that money. That is the choice I would make, but other people would make a different choice. That is a matter we have left to them in the past. We do not believe the case has been made for changing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary&mdash;I do not think I need to elaborate on it any more&mdash;we agree the reporting requirements should be different for small companies than they are for large. We agree with a reduction in the reporting requirements of small companies. We do not believe that it is appropriate&mdash;and it does not automatically follow, in our view&mdash;to raise the reporting requirements for those large companies that the government proposes to raise the reporting requirements for. It would be simpler to say, `You can stay as you are. You will have, therefore, a higher reporting requirement than the small companies, because you will have to either have an auditor or file key financial data. That is a higher standard and it is the standard you have had all along.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I point out that there has been some concern over the Corporations Law simplification process&mdash;not much, I agree; by and large, we hear almost nothing but praise for the process that has been gone through and for the recommendations in the first bill. We are now in the process of consulting on the second bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have raised with us that it is a bit of a hoax to say that the process is one of simplification alone. Some people have taken that to mean that all that would happen, at most, would be putting it into plain English&mdash;which often means a larger bill but, nonetheless, something that everyone could readily understand&mdash;and perhaps a shifting around and consolidating such that the bill would be easier for people to read and to operate under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people say to us&mdash;and they are right&mdash;with respect to the large exempt proprietary companies, `This is not a simplification at all; it is a substantive change to the law. It is an increase in a reporting requirement. It is a greater obligation on those businesses that there has not been an adequate case made out for.' In other words, they do not disagree with wanting the process of simplification to continue, but they simply point out that, just because you call it a simplification law, it does not follow that everything underneath it is. You have to watch what the substance of something is, and the substance of this increases the obligation and makes it more difficult for those companies to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say the case has not been made out and that they should be able to continue under the existing reporting requirements; that is, they will have to choose an auditor or they will have to file key financial statements. I suspect the government do not agree with that, but that is up to them. On that basis, I propose to move the amendment circulated in my name. </PARA>

Roughly, off the top of my head, there would be about 4,000 or 5,000 small businesses in Western Australia. You will be asking them to put an audit down disclosing every facet of their business.

<PARA>This is a very prompt report, and I congratulate the Australian Sports Drug Agency for the speed with which it has reported to the Senate. Also, I commend the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and his office for not holding this report up for the inordinate amount of time that so many ministers seem to hold up their reports. This report was signed on 12 September by my cousin and former colleague, Professor Peter Baume, as Chairperson of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, and here we are, still in September, actually dealing with it. I commend everyone involved. I feel I should do that in view of the times I have criticised the late presentation of these reports. We are going to be inundated with these reports as the year progresses, so it is good to see that some people are prepared to assist the Senate and present these speedily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the Australian Sports Drug Agency is the outstanding lead it is giving in the fight against drugs in sport. In the latest financial year, the agency conducted 3,108 tests, which is up on the 2,002 in the previous year, and it covered 49 sports. There were 819 tests for professional sport leagues, particularly the New South Wales Rugby League, the Australian Football League, the National Basketball League, the National Soccer League and the Queensland Rugby League. This was a considerable increase from the 667 tests of the previous year. In other words, these major professional sports are increasingly using, mainly on a user-pays basis, the services of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency recorded 25 positive test results, which represented about 1.09 per cent of all tests. This was a lower percentage and a lower number than the previous year, even though more tests were made. In the previous year there were 33 positive tests, which represented 1.18 per cent of all tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sporting organisations established that 10 of the 25 positive test results were due to the inadvertent or legitimate therapeutic use of banned substances, and the overall instance of positive drug tests for the use of prohibited substances, such as anabolic steroids and diuretics, was 0.26 per cent, compared to 0.57 per cent in the previous year. In other words, it has been halved. That is an outstandingly good result, and I commend everyone involved for the fact that there has been a halving of the overall incidence of positive drug tests for the use of prohibited substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, almost double the number of competitors refused to comply with the request to provide a sample, and that is a trend that is in the opposite direction and is most unfortunate. Nine competitors failed to do so compared to five in 1993-94, and I hope that severe action is taken against those who fail to provide such tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in a very interesting table at the back of the report at page 102, there is shown to be an enormous number of situations where the penalty for failing to comply with a drug test has not yet been advised to the Australian Sports Drug Agency by the sport involved. While I commend power-lifting and weight-lifting for some severe penalties they have imposed on those people who have been found to have had adverse tests&mdash;for example, in power-lifting, I think there were six altogether&mdash;the fact is that a failure to advise what has happened is not sending the right message. The message that has to be given is that severe action is taken against those who fail to provide a sample. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention that there are quite significant differences in the sorts of penalties between sports. For example, the sport that I am closest to and that I have the most knowledge of, I guess, is soccer football, and I am interested to note that a failure to comply only involved a 12-month suspension; whereas in power-lifting, a failure to comply brought about a three-year suspension. It may well have been a repeat offence, but there is clearly a need, it seems to me, for greater similarity between sports in the severity of penalties involving these offences. I hope these sports do speak to each other about this sort of thing. Also, there should be greater advice quicker. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It shows to the Senate&mdash;and, indeed, to the people of Australia&mdash;that the memorandum of understanding that was entered into between the Australian government and the government of the People's Republic of China is working. Under the terms of that memorandum of understanding, there have now been 369 people returned to their adopted homeland, because they have previously been granted refugee status in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That represents a very significant saving to the Australian taxpayer. It costs some $55 per day, per person to maintain a person at the Port Hedland detention centre. Now that 369 people have been returned, that is saving the taxpayers of Australia some $20,000 per day that they were previously paying for each and every one of those 369 people who illegally came into this country and who illegally sought to abuse the compassion that Australia has for those who are in less fortunate circumstances than ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the further movements and removals of people. There is still quite a large number that remain in detention in this country at great cost not only to the Australian taxpayer but also to themselves. These people who remain in detention can leave at any time and, if they choose to remain in detention and choose to keep their children in detention&mdash;that is the thing that I cannot forgive them for&mdash;I think it says something about them as parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will draw just very brief attention to another article that appeared on the AAP wire service later on today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why this article has appeared now because the decision about this appeal was announced some weeks ago. The announcement of the appeal caused somewhat of a furore back home in Western Australia and has led to the Attorney-General in Western Australia announcing that there is to be a high level appeal into the operations of the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Legal Aid Commission of WA is the legal body which has taken up this appeal on behalf of 118&mdash;I think it is that many; it certainly is over 100&mdash;Sino-Vietnamese people who arrived here on the albatross boat. They are expending great amounts of taxpayers' money on this through a commission which, on its own word of mouth, is strapped for cash and in the last financial year has had to reject some 5,550 applications for legal assistance. We now have an inquiry going into the Legal Aid Commission to see where the money could be better spent than it has perhaps been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that an appeal is going to be lodged. If one reads the decision of Mr Justice O'Loughlin, who delivered the decision on 27 July, one would find it unbelievable that an appeal could be launched against such a decision. These people asserted that, prior to the declaration by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) on 30 December last year that they were not going to apply for refugee status, they had in fact claimed refugee status. When they were questioned in court, they did not even know the Chinese words for `asylum' or `refugee'. For that and a whole number of other reasons Mr Justice O'Loughlin tossed out their application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time available I also want to make some reference to a couple of other groups of illegal boat people who have arrived in this country and remained in detention, at great cost to the Australian taxpayer and of course at great cost to themselves. Mr Justice Sundberg, in the Federal Court on Thursday, 31 August 1995, rejected the claims by four Cambodian boat people that the minister's delegate had made an error in law in not granting them refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I mention this case is that last week in Perth there was a demonstration outside the state office of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to say that this decision is wrong and that the minister should grant those people humanitarian status in Australia. I have read Mr Justice Sundberg's statement. I again find amazing these people who, in breach of orders, claim and take advantage of us all the way through. They get fed, kept and looked after from go to woe and then go into our courts and make exaggerated claims like they could be disadvantaged, if they are returned to Cambodia, because of their religion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to some of the people, His Honour said in his judgment that in relation to applicant one&mdash;I am choosing to use the pseudo names:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think there was any factual basis for the (applicant one's) claim. The material before the delegate was that the applicant did not practise any Chinese customs or religion. She was not taught the Chinese religion, "but may be Buddhist".</PARA>

<PARA>In relation to applicant three, His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he cannot speak Chinese, and not being able to practise the Chinese religion does not worry him because he is not very religious.</PARA>
<PARA>I am appalled that people are able to continue to make these claims. Other people who have received some attention, including from my colleague Senator Chamarette, are two Cambodian brothers who arrived in this country in June 1990, made application for refugee status, had their application considered, were rejected, appealed that decision, were rejected, made an application again, were rejected, appealed the decision again and were rejected&mdash;four rejections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They had two claims before the Federal Court of Australia; they pulled the claims out of the Federal Court of Australia. They are still in detention in Australia. They have not sought to take advantage of the concessions that the minister arranged in 1993&mdash;that, if they were returned to their homeland of Cambodia and stayed there for a year, they could make application for permanent residency in Australia. Many Cambodians have done so. Many have taken up that option and are now settled in Australia, rearing their families and living in good health and good conditions.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The civil war on Bougainville is the story of the victory of the political and economic interests of colonial overlords over principles of human rights and the right to self-determination. This, the UN Decade of Indigenous Peoples has witnessed four of the six years of civil war and suffering on the North Solomon Island of Bougainville but the world has paid little attention. The situation is a complex one and is often further obscured by the dangerously simplistic nature of the debate at times, e.g. in the Australian and Papua New Guinean press and elsewhere. This is due to the communication's blockade on Bougainville which has created an information vacuum.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to acknowledge the presence of Moses and Marilyn Havini in the public gallery. I draw to the attention of senators that Marilyn Taleo Havini has compiled a list of some of the instances of human rights abuses that have come to light between the years 1989 and 1995.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The 1995 compilation of Human Rights Abuses in Bougainville (1989-1995) has been printed this year in response to numerous requests for copies of my initial hand typed document. I had prepared the document as initial preparation for the failed 1994 October 10th Peace Conference. Various Human Rights Organisations (including International Red Cross, Medicines Sans Frontiers, Amnesty International, International Commission of Jurists, UNPO, IWIGIA, Pax Christi and numerous Churches) have sought the material when they discovered that such a document was in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This detailed compilation of gross human rights violations has been assembled in a chronological format and contains reports of a horror that has not been seen in Bougainville, PNG since World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In discussion with lawyers who were assisting the 1994 negotiated Peace Conference towards a political settlement, I expressed my concern for the necessity to address Justice and basic Human Rights issues. Having lived with the people in Bougainville for over 20 years, I knew that the politics that caused the war were born from Government (both PNG and the former Australian) refusal to address basic issues of Justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Bougainville, I lived through the 1989 invasions of both Australian trained PNG Riot Police and PNG Defence Forces on an all but defenceless civilian population. We experienced harassment and cried with others as their human rights were systematically denied in an attempt to cower them into submission. I watched helplessly as the children I taught in High School slipped away into the jungle to join a growing band of Bougainvilleans in forming a Revolutionary Army.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now in Australia, I have been on the receiving end of information from inside Bougainville for five years. I have watched the inhumanity compounded, the suffering recounted as isolated incidents in the form of press releases that were too often ignored by the media.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This listing of human rights abuses is as comprehensive as has been possible, although it is far from complete. It is an attempt to make a starting point for people to come to terms with what has really happened to them. Most of the material has not been available to the general public previously. I have included all violations that can be traced through date and contact source. My hope is that it will become known, not because it is sensational reading, but with the prayer that we will all work to stop the continued violations and murder.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, I wish to emphasise two issues. Firstly, I believe Australia is rapidly moving to being a dictatorship. Why do I say that? Because so many prominent Australians are increasingly reluctant to air their views, particularly where those views are likely to be in conflict with the prevailing views of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the latest example of this is a situation involving the respected Dr Vince FitzGerald, a former high-ranking bureaucrat from Treasury and now a consultant in the private sector. All honourable senators would know that Dr FitzGerald has taken a public role in highlighting the lack of savings in Australia. This attack on Dr FitzGerald is not an isolated incident. The sort of intimidation that increasingly we are seeing on prominent Australians who take a position contrary to that of the government is indeed a worry to all those Australians who are in favour of open, frank and free speech in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Prime Minister who deliberately set out to denigrate the professional reputation of Dr FitzGerald amongst Dr FitzGerald's colleagues and peers. A person of lesser courage, conviction and intellect would have been muzzled by the Prime Minister's action. I think it is testimony to his character and his reputation that, despite that, Dr FitzGerald has hit back and firmly restated his position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second saga is the entry of Bernie Fraser into the debate. I do not mind that at all. It is not what Bernie Fraser said that I believe is so important. That got the news notoriety. The real issue is what Bernie Fraser did not say. I think it is unfortunate that he gave such a one-sided perspective, given his high economic training in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point at issue is whether the high level of Australian debt impacts on interest rates in this country. It may be true that in the 18 most recent interest rates decisions of the Reserve Bank the level of indebtedness may not have been a factor. But allow me to use an analogy. Essentially, Australia is cruising along in a car in overdrive. The problem is that as soon as we get to a hill, we may not have sufficient lower gears to get us up or over the hill. That is the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years there has not been a lot of pressure from international interest rate movements because international interest rates have been relatively benign. While they are benign, it is true that monetary conditions, et cetera, perhaps and certainly do play a more significant role in determining the level of interest rates in Australia. The problem is that when the situation changes&mdash;it will never continue perhaps as it is now, because we do have our ups and downs&mdash;the risk factor is certainly increased. That is important. We are increasingly putting Australia more at risk. While it may be true that today that risk factor may not be overly significant, when things start to stall a little bit that risk factor becomes a lot higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You only have to consider your own personal situation. If you overborrow and property values drop, you are going to be very vulnerable. On the other hand, those who have a lower level of gearing, less borrowings and a lower level of risk can ride out any potential storm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, we are in a situation where Australia has very large international indebtedness. When the Labor Party came to office, it was a mere $34 billion. It is now in excess of $150 billion. The risk factor is climbing. Should international rates change and rise, Australia is going to be in the first line of risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue is: why has it been necessary for Australia to have such a high level of indebtedness? This must come back to the policies pursued by Labor governments, because they have created conditions under which it was not affordable for so many Australians to borrow in Australia, so they went overseas and ran the risk of adverse exchange movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should repeat some words that a former leader of the opposition, John Hewson, constantly used to remind the Australian electorate. He said, `Today, through the actions of this government Australians are passing on to their successors a lower standard of living than we enjoy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who travel overseas the deteriorating exchange rates between Australia and other countries&mdash;for example, Singapore&mdash;are a worry. Regrettably, Australian affordability is slipping, and our relative purchasing ability is declining when compared with that of a number of years ago. The sorts of countries to which we must travel in terms of affordability for limited resources are perhaps the lesser performing countries or those which are emerging from the Eastern bloc. It is a sad scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we examine Australia's savings level&mdash;it is around 17 per cent of gross domestic product&mdash;it is an abysmally low figure. Not so long ago it dropped to about 16 per cent. That is the lowest Australia has had since the two world wars and the Great Depression&mdash;and we certainly do not want that repeated. But if we look at comparable countries, Singapore, for example, which in 35 years has performed an economic miracle, Singapore now has a savings rate of 48 per cent to gross domestic product&mdash;a far cry from our figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy President, the real issue I wish to emphasise and leave with you tonight is in two parts: firstly, that the risk premium on foreign debt is priced into the whole structure of interest rates, which cannot be denied; secondly, and also not to be denied, is that that risk factor is increasing. Therefore, should there be a change in the terms of trade or the value of the exchange rate et cetera, increasingly Australians will be in trouble from the perspective of uncontrolled increases in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was interesting from Bernie Fraser's remarks, although not so widely reported, was `that everything is really linked up with everything else'. In that sentence there is a connection between foreign debt and interest rates. I suppose that is where the head of the Reserve Bank used his escape clause. So I leave you with the comment: it is not what Bernie Fraser said but what he did not say which is the thrust of my contribution and those omissions must be a real worry to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>OUR APPROACH</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Emphasis and focus of the studies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)In accordance with our meeting in Hobart on Monday 9 January and in Launceston on Tuesday 10 January 1995 and following our submissions of October 1994 and January 1995 in relation to the Studies, we confirm the following reflects the changes to our original submission and the agreement reached as to the terms of reference for the Studies:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I.Infrastructure linkages are to be analysed in greater detail. This will include in particular the Airports' interface with ground transport, communications, warehousing etc and the Airports' influences on urban management, State and regional economic growth, industrial development and land use, demographic factors etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">II.There is to be a more focussed emphasis on regional impacts and opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">III.The two studies (Hobart Airport Study and Launceston Airport Study) are to be conducted in parallel and assimilated to the extent necessary to define their role in a Tasmanian economic context. Regional objectives are to be modified to the extent necessary to optimise the integrated development of the State.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IV.The detailed comparison of Hobart and Launceston Airports with other comparable airports and the due diligence work will be moved to Stage 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">V.The project is to be rescheduled so that all factors likely to impact on the Commonwealth budget for 1995/96 can be fully documented before the 24th of February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">VI.The staffing of the project is to be expanded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a)to cover the deeper regional impact requirement</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b)to meet the tighter deadline on the 24th February 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c)to allow work on both Airports to proceed simultaneously and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d)to provide stronger project coordination needed with the larger team.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study will still produce thorough, well-substantiated projections of the commercial and economic factors relevant to the two Airports. It will also examine the management and development of the Airports and related infrastructure in the context of anticipating and perhaps even stimulating demand and regional growth. We will make sure that the different demands, expectations and opportunities of each Airport are not blurred by the State consolidation of some of the study's outputs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. Amplification of the scope</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Fundamental to any analysis of potential strategies and structures for Hobart and Launceston Airports will be:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a complete assimilation of the effects and of the projected results of the two ventures to show a net State benefit;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.an analysis of the likely returns to be generated by the Airports under a number of different scenarios involving improvements to its facilities and to the related infrastructure servicing the Airports;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the establishment of an appropriate framework for assessing the likely economic and other benefits to each region and to the State flowing from these changed management practices and facilities;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.appraisal of the Airports primarily in the context of them being transport interchanges and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.an interim report covering and substantiating the levels of expenditure needed and justifiable for future capital works and redevelopment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) We therefore propose to conduct the assignment in a number of phases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Absolute, undistracted priority will be given to completing the interim report at the end of Phase 3 by the 24th February, 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Each of the phases will involve consultation with the two Working Groups and where necessary with the Steering Committee to ensure that the study progresses according to the needs of all interested parties. On completion of each phase we would anticipate holding a workshop session to ensure that agreement is reached as to the precise manner in which the project should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) We had previously expanded the original Terms of Reference somewhat in line with our assessment of the requirements. These requirements have since been refined and refocussed. The expanded and modified Terms of Reference represent Stage 1 of the assignment and are covered by the first six Phases of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STAGE ONE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Phase 1. Setting the Framework</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) We will meet with the Steering Committee and Working Groups to scope the project, review the approach, define the expected results and determine the framework for the written outputs. We will put together as an introductory chapter to the project, a full description and facilities audit for each Airport and this will be the basis for a current and projected needs analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) In this Phase the revamped schedule and new deadlines will be reviewed, amended and agreed. Times for the formal progress review and direction meetings with the Steering Committee will be set and a programme of sessions with the Working Groups will be compiled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Phase 2. Data Collection</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) This Phase will consist of a facilities audit for each Airport (using the FAC's Master Plans as a starting point), the initiation of the community consultation process, information gathering generally and the development of our approach through collation and analysis of available information on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Hobart and Launceston Airports;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.other Australian and overseas airports;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the impact possible changes would have on the Tasmanian economy and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the key elements of a financial model which could ensure the viability of each Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) We will define the capital expenditure timing and triggers for each Airport and assemble a complete list of all possible development projects for the Airports and for their related economic interfaces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) We will progress far enough with the business and strategic plans for each Airport and its region to enable issues of capital adequacy, gearing and viability to be resolved. This will then lead to workshop sessions between the project team and the Steering Committee and/or the Working Groups to agree upon:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1.the structure and format of the interim report to be presented on the 24th February 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2.full details of the approach to be taken in Phase 3.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) This framework will necessarily include a method for comparing the economic and other effects of the various options on each region and on the State as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) As the impact of the various likely effects such as increased tourism and employment on regional finances and economic indicators has already been the subject of extensive analysis by various parties, we would propose to use this established work as a starting point for our own independent assessments and for constructing the framework for comparison of options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Phase 3.Financials, Capital Works and Interim Report on Commonwealth Government Commitment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) The optimum structures and means for increasing State and regional influences on the Airports can only be determined after thorough analysis of the financial effects (on both the Airports and the Tasmanian economy) of the various possible options for the operation and development of the Airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(15) Consideration will also be given to how the community service and capital works requirements can or should be best met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(16) This phase will consist of detailed financial modelling and sensitivity analysis designed to predict for five, ten and twenty years hence:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.freight tonnages, pax numbers, aircraft movements and loadings;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the current and potential revenues of each Airport;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the effect on key economic and other indicators of the various options; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the likely funding required by each Airport, i.e. the net cash flows expected;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.potential impacts on regional and State economic development;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.potential impacts on urban management and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(17) These models will incorporate both the likely costings for the various proposed developments and the potential revenues for each Airport. For this we would have access to FAC materials and to non-confidential information on our own files to assist in constructing these financial models.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(18) The cash flows for capital projects (both on the Airports and for infrastructure related to the Airports) and the effects on recurrent expenditure from various levels of debt and from the community service components of airport operations will be documented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(19) A draft interim report covering all relevant issues likely to have any bearing on the 1995/96 Commonwealth Budget will be presented on the 24th February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(20) This Phase will be completed with working sessions with the Steering Committee and/or the Working Groups in which the appraisals already made will be reviewed and directions given on additional analyses required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Phase 4. Strategic and Business Planning</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(21) This will start with a complete SCORE strengths, Constraints, Opportunities, Risks and Expectations) analysis of each Airport and the identification of all relevant strategic issues for the State and for each region and the development of the key elements of a strategic plan for each Airport and its effects on its region. We will develop models to reflect the price sensitivities and other impacts of the major revenue generating options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(22) We will put together from best available sources the information indicated in "3 Marketing Audit" of the two Terms of Reference. At this time we will also define in a strategic context the objectives of those airport related organisations (as set out in Point 1 of both Terms of Reference) and identify ways in which these can be best melded into the objectives for the Airports and their regions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(23) We propose producing a precis of current and future marketing programmes likely to have a bearing on the functioning of the Airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(24) Plans and projections for the Airports' commercial operations will be developed covering:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the main options in relation to each Airport which need to be considered in detail;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the parameters of commercial activity which would be expected or tolerated at each Airport;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the framework against which various options will be measured.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(25) We will prepare:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a financial history for each Airport, detailed cost and revenues projections and structures and model cash flows and profits</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a full re-work of the revenue and expenses under the FAC's management</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.recalculation of the profits (Hobart $385,000 and Launceston $286,000 before interest for 1993/94) on the basis of proposed new ownership</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a preliminary review of the Airports' tax liabilities under new ownership to ascertain whether the very high levels of income tax paid by the FAC would continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(26) A discussion paper will be prepared and this Phase will end with working sessions with the Working Groups in which the appraisals already made will be reviewed and directions given on the final Phases of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Phase 5. Ownership/Leaseholder Appraisal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(27) This Phase will extend the analysis established earlier by assessing the potential returns to investors under a number of different options including various forms of private and public sector funding at various levels through different debt and equity structures and other funding means. This will include consideration of the types of ownership structures that will be acceptable to the regions, to the governments and to other parties concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(28) These structures are likely to involve a combination of such financing techniques as:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">public equity offerings;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">sale of non-required assets;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">dedicated funding trusts;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">limited or unlimited government guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(29) The analysis will also cover the issues related to the appropriate timing for raising the necessary finance for development of the Airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(30) After analysis of the likely financial returns available to investors in each Airport it is envisaged that a small number of preferred options for viable structures will have been produced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(31) We will then consider likely generic participants who may wish to participate as investors such as:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) Defence does not keep records in a form that enables the question to be answered with accuracy. This is because the data is based on the place of payment rather than the state to which the payment is being directed. The expenditure data can also be distorted as some payments are made to contractors' head office which can be located in states and territories removed from where the contract work is being performed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) Certain other elements of Defence expenditure, including some capital equipment payments, are handled centrally. As a consequence, the expenditure profiles for some states and territories are distorted. For example, certain payments associated with the New Submarine, JORN and the Geraldton communications facility are paid in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) Expenditure on Service salaries can also be unreliable as portion of the payments are made to banks in the state branch where the member's account is domiciled rather than the state where the member is posted. Additionally, banks do not recognise the ACT and the Northern Territory as head offices (in Defence's accounting system these payments are recorded against New South Wales and South Australia respectively).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv) The ACT figures have increased substantially since 1993-94 due to increased superannuation contributions; the impact of the increase in the effective rate of Fringe Benefits Tax; and the introduction of Accrual Based Superannuation payments.</PARA>
