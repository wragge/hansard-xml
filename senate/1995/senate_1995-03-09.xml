<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not suggest that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, is attempting to come the raw prawn with the Senate on these particular measures, but I do feel that he is trying to use these in an attempt to suggest to the Senate that this is an unintended consequence of the November decision. It is not an unintended consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was specifically decided, in Senator Chamarette's motion last November, that there should be a situation where legislation that is introduced in one session should not be debated until the next session. That is to say, legislation introduced in the Senate in one session will not be debated until the next session of the Senate. Let us have no unders and overs about that; that was perfectly clear. It is unfair for the minister to come in here and use this occasion every time to suggest that this is an unintended consequence. It was not an unintended consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, Senator Chamarette made perfectly clear&mdash;Senator Chamarette can talk for herself&mdash;the reason that she moved that motion and it was all part of keeping the government honest, particularly Senator Evans, which is a difficult task, from my experience. I am not suggesting that he is dishonest in the pejorative sense; I am talking about politically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this motion because of the matters that Senator Faulkner has outlined about the legislation. It is non-controversial, it has the full support of everybody concerned and there is no reason why, in the circumstances, it should not be exempted from the cut-off motion. But let us not use these occasions as unintended consequences of the motion moved by Senator Chamarette and adopted by this chamber. If the minister is suggesting that because these bills were introduced into the House of Representatives at the end of the session&mdash;one of them was introduced on the last day of the session&mdash;they should be able to be debated in the Senate the next session, that is quite contrary to the spirit of the Chamarette motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Senate but I want briefly to concur with the remarks that have already been made. I think Senator Harradine explained it perfectly clearly that the reason for the cut-off motion was two-fold. It was to allow time for scrutiny, so that when a bill is introduced in one session it is not debated until the next and we can consult the community, look at the legislation and do our job in the Senate. The second reason was to prevent the abuse of the parliamentary process that goes on when there is a log jam of legislation passed on the final day. We are getting pretty close to that and I believe the government's amendment to that procedural motion is being deferred to the first day of the next sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we are actually allowing the log jam in the last session of the House of Representatives to cause a log jam in the Senate in the last couple of weeks of this session. I believe the procedural motion should be enforced so that not only does the Senate have adequate time for scrutiny but also it conducts its business in an orderly fashion and is not pushed into the same kind of log jam as occurred in the House of Representatives. I do not have any objections to the exemptions to allow these bills to be dealt with today. I think it is perfectly appropriate that the Senate agree that those bills should come on. That does not mean that we agree that the principle of introducing a bill in one session and debating it the next is not a valid one.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1402 standing in the name of Senator Alston for this day, relating to media ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important motion because it seeks to put both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Mr Lee in a position of demonstrating to the Australian public that either they have evidence to support the outrageous allegations they have been making over the last couple of weeks or they are exposed stark naked as not having any evidence but nonetheless are prepared to make these outrageous allegations. Mr Lee last night on television was reduced to saying that the government does not have any evidence but it would like the opposition to give the government its evidence. In other words, it is now a matter for us to somehow provide material on which the government would want to rely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Gareth Evans went through a very tawdry and tortuous process to try to demonstrate that what was on the public record somehow constituted evidence of a secret deal. I think that is the longest bow drawn since Robin Hood. But, clearly, as far as Senator Evans is concerned, it beggars imagination to think that he could be a candidate for the High Court if that is the level of his understanding of the judicial processes and the way in which these sorts of allegations ought to be dealt with. I am sure that if he were outside this chamber he would be acutely embarrassed at the fact that not a skerrick of evidence has been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate to the Senate that when we talk about deals there is only one party and, above all, one politician with a long-held reputation for doing deals with media bosses. To whom was Conrad Black referring when he said he was told that an application to increase his stake in Fairfax would be entertained if he provided balanced political coverage? I ask whether senators know to whom editorial executive Max Suich was referring in a 1987 board minute reporting on an extended meeting with a politician when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his motives for getting involved in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald and Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> takeover were a desire to see the (Melbourne) <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> broken up and a desire to hurt Fairfax . . . The Treasurer is a product of the NSW right wing of the ALP and his conversation is littered with threats, references to getting even, doing deals and assisting `our crowd' in business, the press and within the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope people do not have any doubt to whom Max Suich was referring. He went on to say Mr Keating was `very blunt about the fact that the NSW right are "deal makers" and they provide favours to "our crowd" in return for favours given'. If the time is available subsequently, any number of further examples can be put on the record to demonstrate beyond doubt that Paul Keating has no compunction whatsoever in trying to do deals. We have just seen the one in relation to woodchipping in New South Wales and once again a decision in relation to interest rate increases&mdash;both deliberately designed to avoid damage to Bob Carr in the lead-up to the New South Wales election. I do not think the Australian public has any doubt at all what is really going on here. The Prime Minister is desperately on the defensive because he does not have John Howard's measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed the Prime Minister was quoted in Bonn yesterday as saying that what John Howard should do is come up with a plan that will drive him mad. Of course, the fact is that John Howard has and it is. The Prime Minister is being driven out of his tree by the fact that he cannot tackle us on merits. When he should be debating the real issues, he is instead out there trying to defame as many people as possible and to intimidate businessmen who might even have the temerity to suggest that it is about time we had a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do senators remember the episode relating to Dick Warburton reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> some weeks ago when he said that since the last election Mr Keating had simply been trying to bully business into silence and that he was not going to cop it any longer? That is yet another example of the way in which the Prime Minister is prepared to make these sorts of allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with comments made by Senator Kernot in recent days, the urgency of this motion is that, if the Prime Minister and Mr Lee have any evidence, the proper place to present that evidence would be before a formal Senate committee, where they are on oath and where the allegations can be properly tested and examined. The people of Australia would then have the opportunity to assess the merits of the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the moment we have stony silence, a desperate Prime Minister now trying to talk up the republic as his latest diversion, presumably wanting to talk about anything but the matters that have dominated so-called public debate in Australia recently. I hope the Democrats will accept the need to provide this opportunity to people who make allegations in the public arena to come forward and justify their claims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support establishing urgency by Senator Alston in order to move this motion. We have witnessed in this country over the last few weeks the spectacle, yet again, of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) acting as a bullyboy to public citizens, trying to get his way by asserting certain things without one shred of evidence. What is particularly disgraceful about the behaviour of the Prime Minister in this pursuit is that he has done most of it from overseas. He has severely embarrassed foreign heads of state as he has pursued a domestic political matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the real agenda behind this domestic political matter? The Prime Minister is upset that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is well ahead in the polls and all his best efforts to tear down the Leader of the Opposition are failing. He has had a long history of personal denigration and trying to tear down leaders of the opposition. He has met his match this time because it is just not working. His own government is highly embarrassed about his behaviour. We only had to watch here yesterday Senator Gareth Evans get up and try to defend the indefensible. Here is a man who normally sits across the chamber from us and who is touted as a future member of the bench of the High Court. How on earth could he get up as he did yesterday&mdash;and it is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record forever&mdash;to defend such an indefensible position as the Prime Minister's?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the Minster for Communications, Mr Lee, little Sir Echo, out there to doorstop yesterday, caught like a rabbit in a spotlight, knowing that the Prime Minister was telling Richos and trying to defend him. Where is the evidence? When you ask the government for the evidence, all it can come up with is what our policy position was in 1987, when we had some concerns about cross-media ownership rules&mdash;and we still do, and a lot of people have. That is quite legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has been really caught out. All the major players&mdash;Mr Howard, Mr Packer, the senior executives of Fairfax, including people in the Fairfax organisation like Graham Richardson, have all come out and said that there is no deal. Why has this private citizen, Mr Packer, been bullied by the Prime Minister? He dared to take a different stance from the Prime Minister. He dared to say that John Howard would become a good Prime Minister. That so incensed this bullyboy Prime Minister that he went down his usual tack. The stories are legion about what he does to people who disagree with him. Just ask the press gallery. He roars down the phone at them if they disagree with him. He roared down the phone at a range of other people, such as people who supported us in the business community after the last election. If anyone disagrees with him they get publicly attacked. This time the Prime Minister has gone too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is now trying desperately to shift the spotlight off himself and onto a new issue. This is proof that what the Prime Minister has done is wrong. He has been caught out telling Richos yet again and he is now bringing up the republic debate. That would be the surest evidence that we have the public spectacle of a Prime Minister not telling the truth. He is desperate to escape the situation. He should not be. He is the Prime Minister of this country and he should be called to account for this sort of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best way to call the Prime Minister to account is, as this notice of motion states in its last part, to reconvene the print media inquiry and call the Prime Minister before it for him to explain himself. That is why I believe this motion is urgent. I urge the Senate to debate it in full and I urge the minor parties, which have obviously observed the disgraceful behaviour of the Prime Minister on this matter both at home and overseas, to support it so that we can have a full and proper debate on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose this proposition. I do so on the basis that if you wanted serious debate in this country about media laws, if you wanted serious debate about the cultural direction this country should take in terms of its public media, the last place you would go is to a Senate select committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular Senate select committee has been from its very inception prejudiced and flawed. The evidence presented did not in any way support the conclusions that had been drawn well before the committee's establishment. For instance, in relation to this Fairfax inquiry, Senator Alston indicated his attitude on radio on 26 November 1993 that it was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who was in the dock. That was the basis on which this committee was established&mdash;that the Prime Minister was in the dock. Here again today exactly the same sorts of sentiments are being expressed&mdash;that the Prime Minister is in the dock. The Senate is not a court of law. The Senate is not the place to set up political, biased committees aimed at producing a political result which will further the case for the Liberal Party as it sees it in its own twisted view of reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a committee that has not met for five months. It has no secretariat. Its material has been put into archive, where it belongs. Presumably the chairman of that committee has been picking up his benefits for five months without doing any work. We now have to ask ourselves why we have this proposition before the Senate today. Clearly, what we have is a political stunt by the opposition. Here we have a position being taken by the opposition to advance its grubby political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is all this about? The political issue that would be debated publicly and fully is the political issue of who actually should own Australia's media. In this country we have very high levels of concentration of media ownership. But what do we see from the opposition? What is its policy on this matter? Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, spelt it out very clearly on 17 February in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think technology has rendered the rules redundant.</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking there about the cross-media rules. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was always a bit sceptical about the wisdom of prohibitions. I was always a pro-market sort of person.</PARA>
<PARA>So you have the position in this country at the moment of the opposition advocating a policy of removing the cross-media laws, a position aimed at allowing the market to determine who should own Australia's media. The Liberals have said time and time again that that is their view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in recent days five occasions on which Mr Costello and Mr Howard have refused to spell out their position. They do not resile from that proposition in fact that they are pro-market sorts of persons. We have seen quite clearly the position of Mr Howard, who has said, `What I say in public is what I say in private.' Good on him, because at least he is straight about it&mdash;unlike Senator Alston, who is implying a position completely different from that which the conservative parties actually stand for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this proposal all about? Does the opposition really believe that the Prime Minister will rush before a committee such as this one, which has been stacked from the beginning and which is biased in its terms of reference? It is quite clearly prejudiced and follows a deliberate political agenda. Does it not honestly believe that that sort of process will be undertaken? If the opposition is serious about media rules, it will engage in full and public debate. It will reveal its policies up front. It will say up front what it stands for. It would not take the opportunistic and banal approach that has been taken to date of trying to suggest that it stands for something that it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, it has to ask itself about the role of the Senate in these proceedings. The establishment of politically biased select committees&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support this motion for the suspension of standing orders, although I hope that we do not spend too much time debating the issue as we have a lot of business to get through today. I want to revisit some of the facts. This committee has had a lot of experience in sifting through claim and counterclaim. The jury is out on who was believed last time. We have the same problem this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, all this motion requires is that the committee invite the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) to provide evidence. That could be in written form. That is a much more simple mechanism than what we have embarked upon in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems quite clear that since the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications and the Arts have been challenged on this issue they have ducked for cover. It seems that there is no evidence to hand about a direct deal between Mr Packer and Mr Howard. It seems that no Packer employee will come forward to lend support to their arguments. It seems that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications and the Arts have rejected an opportunity to publicly put forward the evidence they say they have which is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that we pursue the matter of this evidence as reasonably as we can. But that does not mean, to me anyway, that this is simply a matter of coalition witch-hunting. As far as I am concerned, what is at issue is media policy and the rules. The rules are crook. If the rules were transparent, it would not matter if Paul Keating had a conversation with Conrad Black or if Kerry Packer had a conversation with John Howard. It would not matter. If the rules were set in concrete and were open and transparent, no deals could be done. While ever we have this prime ministerial and ministerial discretion overriding the role of parliament, this is exactly what is going to continue to happen. The opposition needs to think about this, because it gives an opportunity for exploitation. I would be happy for the committee to yet again look at the whole notion of media ownership. It is not covered in this motion, but I would consider amending it in some form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, I foreshadow that I will seek to amend this motion. I have just discussed this with Senator Alston. I would seek to add this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) In the event that the Prime Minister and Minister for Communications and the Arts provide the Committee with evidence, then the Leader of the Opposition be invited to refute such evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>In the previous committee, the Democrats requested the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to appear. We seek to include both major parties in that way in this notice of motion. I am foreshadowing that I will move this amendment if we suspend the standing orders. I believe that that is probably what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has made serious allegations. The Senate has an opportunity to seek the evidence from him and the communications minister to support those allegations. They are equally as serious as the allegations made about deals done between Mr Black and Mr Keating and about what Mr Hawke may or may not have said in the past and what Dr Hewson may or may not have said in the past. This is about media policy. It deserves our scrutiny. There is a sense of urgency about this. I think the mechanism that is proposed in this motion to deal with it is a very sensible one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, the government will be opposing this suspension of standing orders and I can assure the Senate that we will also be opposing the substantive motion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the government's intention this morning in that circumstance to prolong a debate about this particular issue on either a suspension of standing orders or the motion that Senator Alston is proposing to move. The government is going to make it very clear that we really do consider this to be a very tawdry, very grubby political exercise. That is all it is. It is made very clear in the motion that Senator Alston has placed on notice, expressing grave concern that neither the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) nor the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has provided any evidence to support their allegations of a secret deal and so on. These are all the insinuations that we have come to expect from the opposition as we see what has been a continuing and deliberate misuse of the Senate committee system to further what can only be described as the lowest political motives imaginable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This substantive motion is no more than a political statement from the opposition. It is no more than an attempt yet again to subvert the committee system and the committee processes of the Senate for these extraordinarily base political motives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already had an explanation of what the status of this particular committee is. It completed its work, as Senator Carr indicated, quite some time ago now. We now have this attempt to stoke a bit of fire into the embers of a committee that had sunk without trace.

<PARA>I indicated earlier why there was some urgency about this matter, and the contributions that we heard from the government side simply reinforce how critical it is that we address the fundamental issue: that is, in a democratic society, it is absolutely essential that people who make very serious allegations ought to be required to substantiate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a long history of making outrageous statements and then simply thumbing his nose at those who have the temerity to object, this provides a very good opportunity for him to come along in a serious forum and put his position on the record. You will recall his response to the print media inquiry when we found that he had effectively tried to bribe Conrad Black by promising him balanced coverage in exchange for an increase in the level of foreign ownership&mdash;he sent a raspberry from Paris. That is the sort of way in which the Prime Minister responds to serious issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I will just tell you a little anecdote about that one. I was fast asleep in a hotel in Sydney at about 2 o'clock one morning when I was woken up by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The interviewer said to me, `Given that you've been the chair of this committee and that there have been a number of serious matters discussed involving Conrad Black who is a Canadian, perhaps you would like to explain to our listeners across Canada what this is all about.' So, given the convention that we on this side of the chamber believe still applies that you should be very careful about airing domestic linen internationally, I did my best to simply retell the facts of the matter&mdash;what Mr Black had said in his book, what Mr Keating then said in Seattle. When I had explained all this about the Prime Minister asking for a commitment to balanced coverage, the interviewer said to me, `Say, is that right; so when's this guy going to gaol?' That is how seriously the CBC viewed those allegations. Yet all we got from the Prime Minister was, `Raspberry to you, couldn't care less, not interested.' That is his track record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the altar boy faithfully supporting Mr Keating again this week, again without a skerrick of evidence. What is very important in this debate as well is that Mr Lee's position ought to be clarified. It is not good enough for him, wanting to be the heir apparent, to somehow aspire to the leadership of this nation by simply trying to get there on the Prime Minister's coat tails, particularly when he is in a position of having to decide whether he has his own independent views on this matter or whether he should slavishly follow those of the Prime Minister. Yet time and again, in question time and elsewhere, Mr Lee has been given the chance to put up or shut up. On each occasion he has failed to provide a skerrick of evidence and claimed that the Prime Minister had received firm evidence from inside the Packer camp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was Mr Lee saying last night? Something to the effect of, `Well, we don't reveal our sources, we don't really know what went on, but we invite you to give us your evidence to support our allegations.' That is preposterous and outrageous. One can understand why little Sir Echo finds himself between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, he knows that his political career depends on falling in line with the Prime Minister; yet, at the same time, he knows that the Prime Minister has simply made allegations that he cannot substantiate and that Mr Howard has comprehensively refuted them. No other person in the country has provided any solace to the Prime Minister, so he is reduced to desperately trying to change the subject overseas&mdash;very belatedly, I might say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Laurie Oakes made very clear yesterday, it was not accidental that Mr Keating got up in Singapore and embarrassed and humiliated the Singapore leader in the way that he did. He had decided on the plane, on the way over, that he wanted to give this another big airing. In fact, I think it was Greg Turnbull, his press secretary, who invited the media to ask questions on the very joint platform with the Singaporean Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a set-up, yes. I am sure that, if the Singaporean Prime Minister had known that he was going to be embarrassed in that way, he would not have had a bar of it. But of course that was not on Mr Keating's agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a person with a long history of deal making&mdash;probably the ultimate deal maker in Australian politics&mdash;very proud of himself. As I said earlier, Max Suich made the reference that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he is very blunt about the fact that the NSW right are `deal makers' and that they provide favours to `our crowd' in return for favours given . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Let me just ask this question: to whom was William Shawcross referring in his biography of Rupert Murdoch when he said that he:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . had had dinner with Murdoch several weeks beforehand (the Cabinet decision . . . ) and told him of his plans. Murdoch said later that it sounded so fantastic that he thought it would never get through Cabinet. Keating also alerted Packer but gave no such advance warning to either the Herald or the Fairfax groups. When the Cabinet agreed to the Keating plan and it was announced, Murdoch knew that this would be the best possible time to sell his television stations and to become an even more powerful Prince of Print. He made his dash from the slopes of Aspen back to Australia to try and buy the Herald.</PARA>
<PARA>To whom was Shawcross referring when he spoke of an ALP caucus meeting subsequent to cabinet approving the cross-media rules at which the gentleman in question attacked the Herald and said `it would be good if it was split up' because it was `not one of us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked on 6PR, I think it was, the other day about some of the Prime Minister's allegations, and particularly about what Mr Keating had said in November 1993 about Kerry Stokes. Remember, Kerry Stokes gave the Boyer lectures last year and made some very intelligent contributions about the future of the superhighway, its implications for Australia, and consequences for national sovereignty in relation to the transfer of data and information. Mr Stokes is an eminent Australian, not only one I would have thought deserving of being taken seriously but also one we should regard as a very great success story in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did Mr Keating say about Mr Stokes in November 1993? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't have to deal with the Kerry Stokes of this world. He's a bit below my speed.</PARA>
<PARA>A couple of weeks back, Alan Ramsay told us&mdash;I think it was about a farewell for Geoff Walsh:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating told his listeners, amongst other things, that he'd `fixed Fairfax once before and now they're all back again. If I have to, I'll do it again. Alexander, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald's</EMPHASIS> editor-in-chief spent his time sucking up to Sydney's yuppies and if he gets in my way I'll stick it right up him'&mdash;a remark accompanied by a jabbing stiff index finger.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`and if you blokes think I'll just bend over and let you day after day and I'll cop it'&mdash;I think that is expletive deleted&mdash;and if necessary he'd crush Alexander and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>, grinding the toe of his shoe on the floor to emphasise the point.</PARA>
<PARA>He even went on to say about Paul Kelly, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, to whose son he is the godfather, that Kelly could not even pick his nose when it came to politics. This man has an extraordinary history. As Ramsay reported, he told an extraordinary story of how supposedly he had almost run Murdoch out of the country some years ago and that he probably should have done it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the Prime Minister's reputation for ringing people up. If there is any media proprietor that he wants to vent his spleen on when it comes to articles that he disagrees with, he rings them up and abuses them ferociously in the foulest possible language. Again, he has tried to intimidate I think the business community at large with his attack on Mr Packer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is so utterly reprehensible about the current episode is that these allegations about a secret deal between Mr Packer and Mr Howard have been comprehensively refuted. Mr Keating has simply stuck to his line through thick and thin and he has been supported by Little Sir Echo. It is just not good enough to have those sorts of allegations made on the public record. It is the big lie technique. You throw a bit of mud, hope that it sticks and hope that in six months time people say, `Don't I recall there was something about a secret deal between Packer and Howard. You never know, do you. Where there is smoke there is fire.' I would have thought that anyone who was seriously addressing the issue could come to only one conclusion that there simply is no evidence at all to support these outrageous allegations. Therefore, the opportunity to present material before a Senate committee is the very least that the parliament can do to pursue the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is breathtaking to hear Senator Faulkner talking about all the usual insinuations in this proposal. The fact is all the insinuations, all the alleged circumstantial evidence upon circumstantial evidence, is what the government relies on. The government said as recently as yesterday, when Senator Evans was asked about the matter, that the evidence of the secret deal is all on the public record. Then we go through a few bits and pieces from which any reasonable citizen would infer there must have been a secret deal. Otherwise, why would you have a view on the cross-media rules?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the state of debate we have reached in this country, it is a very sorry situation. I would have thought the last thing we want in this country is for people to be accused of all sorts of nefarious activities simply on the basis of expressing an opinion about the law, particularly when the Prime Minister himself has said on a number of occasions that the onset of technology is tending to make those rules obsolete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is not the only one who has said that. A number of people have said it. As recently as last week Brian Johns said it in the Broadband Services Expert Group report. That will be the fact, of course, when Murdoch brings Star in from Hong Kong after 1997, as he will inevitably be allowed to do, as we get more and more on-line services accessible from Australia internationally, as we have on-line publishing, and as we have all sorts of creative ways of transmitting information. Obviously pay television is only the latest. The ABC news and current affairs channel will be yet another forum for dissemination of views. Clearly these rules are not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think even Senator Kernot said they were crook. They are crook not only in the sense that they allow for a great deal of subjectivity but also in the sense that they were supposed to achieve a strict dichotomy between print and television. You were allowed to be a prince of print, queen of the screen, but not both. Yet what do we have in this country? We have major players who have a foot in both television and print media camps. Given that telecommunications is the fastest growing industry in the world, it seems bizarre that there are virtually no limits on cross-media in relation to telecommunications. I suppose the fact that magazines are excluded is more evidence of the anomalies that exist in this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the rules are in need of review. When Mr Lee talked about the review of the Broadcasting Services Act, he made it clear that there could not be a sensible review unless a review of the cross-media rules was included. All we have said is, `Bring forward that review. Let's have a look at all the evidence and see what is the most effective way of promoting plurality and diversity.' On that basis, together with Mr Howard's comments which show how utterly consistent he has been in his scepticism about the effectiveness of the cross-media rules since 1987&mdash;at a time, as he points out, when Mr Packer was publicly advocating a vote for that paragon of virtue Bob Hawke&mdash;we now have the Prime Minister descending to this Fuhrer-like behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that those who make those allegations ought to be required to produce evidence. The Senate print media committee provides the perfect opportunity to do just that. Let us not have any more of the nonsense which suggests that somehow, because the government does not have the numbers on the committee, the committee is biased. You can say that about any parliamentary committee. Someone has got the numbers on them. We do not have the numbers outright. We rely on the Democrats for support on that committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Greens. For many years, up until 1993, you have been used to having the absolute numbers on all your committees, and you still do in the House of Representatives. Does that mean that every committee that you ever commission to examine an issue is, by definition, biased? Does that mean that any terms of reference are fundamentally flawed? Does that mean that it is perfectly improper for the parliament to examine these issues? Does it mean that, simply because the government of the day has a contrary view, it is somehow illegitimate for an opposition to want to make use of those committee structures? Of course it does not. All you are doing is playing the partisan game. I understand that, and I can understand why you will keep saying that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember Senator Collins saying&mdash;I think he said it in opposition but, undoubtedly, his view has not changed in government&mdash;that you say anything to advance your cause. So be it. No doubt we will have more of the same shortly. The fact remains that political processes are available to provide a measure of protection to witnesses who have the courage to come forward and elaborate on their concerns, to put evidence on the public record to support allegations they have made elsewhere. This is the perfect opportunity for both the Prime Minister and the nominal Minister for Communications and the Arts to put up or shut up. </PARA>

I will seek to contain myself to as close to five minutes as I can and certainly to no more time than Senator Alston took.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to that code in a minute. Do not worry. You might think I am traversing the opposition's policy, but it is actually something Senator Alston said in his comments, so I assume it is as relevant when I respond to it as when he said it. He said that the Leader of the Opposition has had a consistent policy on this issue since 1987. I will come back to some of the implications of that in a moment. One of the significant points we have to make is that between 1987 and 1995 there was a major detour taken that is directly relevant to this issue. It is very interesting to determine why, between 1991 and 1995, we have had this dramatic return to the policy of 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, Mr Howard's expressed view was that he would and the government should oppose the sale of the Fairfax group to any individual or consortium that would result in a greater concentration of media ownership and thus a diminution of competition in a diversity of information sources in Australia. That was the policy he signed up to in 1991. He put his name to that in 1991. He signed a petition to that effect in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was his policy then so why is it not his policy now? When Ray Martin asked him the same question, why did he duck and weave? He did not duck and weave in 1991. That was his policy. He has done a U-turn in relation to the policy that there should be no ownership of Fairfax that could lead to the diminution of competition and the diversity of information sources in Australia. Why is that not his policy now? What are the factors in the transition from then to now? That is a very important public policy question. I will not go through the charade of pretending that a Senate committee is going to help us find the answer to that, but the Australian people will ultimately come to a conclusion on that very important question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available to me I am not going to reiterate those points. I simply say that I endorse the points made by Senator Evans in his articulation of some of the interconnections that give reasonable grounds for suspicion, shall we say to be polite. He said that yesterday in four minutes. In the time available to me, I will not reiterate that, but simply endorse it. The capacity of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he returns, to say what he chooses about his evidence and what he chooses to make clear is a matter for him and I will not in any way reiterate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that this motion is just a stunt. The Senate should start from the reasonable presumption that neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) will appear before the committee. I think that is probably a presumption that everybody shares. So why are we having this motion? It is an excuse for a few people to make speeches about this issue. There are plenty of other procedural devices. It is a pity we are getting bogged down with this one when we could be dealing with substantial issues of good governance of the country; but we have it before us, so let us deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are there reasonable grounds for suspicions about what has caused this transition between 1991 and 1995 in Mr Howard's view? What should we conclude about what might have been the cause of this? There is a lot of speculation about what constitutes a deal or coming to an arrangement. It seems to me that when you see individuals and/or groups taking concerted action in support of mutually advantageous goals you can start to say, `This is walking a bit like a duck, it's even quacking a bit like a duck, perhaps it is a duck.' Here we have two simultaneous events: the opposition clearly sending coded messages, clear signals that it will allow Packer to buy Fairfax&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All you are burning are your previous policy positions. The smoke signals are very easy to read. They are saying, `We will allow Packer to buy Fairfax.' Suddenly Kerry Packer said, `John Howard isn't a bad bloke.' There are a number of explanations for why these coordinated and concerted actions towards mutually advantageous goals might have taken place. One is that there could have been an overt deal. They could have said, `We will agree to change our policy in return for your support.' That is one possible explanation and there are those who think there is evidence to support that. Let us leave that there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another possibility. It could be a covert deal. They could be saying, `We will make it clear, without explicitly saying so, that we are going to allow Mr Packer to buy Fairfax. We are going to say, "We'll leave it to the Trade Practices Commission,"  when we know the Trade Practices Commission has said, "We regard newspaper and television markets as separate, therefore, Mr Packer will be allowed to buy Fairfax".' You could say, `I still hold the policy I had in 1987 which meant I would allow Mr Packer to buy Fairfax,' and not refer to the different policy you had in 1991. That is also code for, `We will allow Mr Packer to buy Fairfax and, coincidentally, we will receive Mr Packer's support at the same time but in an entirely unrelated way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third possible explanation is that coalition members have a policy which they do not want to make public, which is that they are just policy vandals who are actually determined to annihilate pluralism in our media in this country. That is a third possible explanation. If that is the one they want to opt for, I will accept it; although I think it is more likely to be one or two places higher up in the pecking order of possibilities. So we have all those elements coming together. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thing that distinguishes government and opposition on this is typified by this argument about allowing the TPC to decide. I have great respect for the Trade Practices Commission and for its chairman. I do not agree with every decision he makes, but it is a very important  institution in our country in relation to competition. As a result of Hilmer, we hope to strengthen those competition issues. But media ownership is more than an economic issue. It is more than about simple questions of competition as to who owns baked beans factories, which are important, but relate to an economic issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an economic issue, but it is also a social and a cultural issue. It is an issue about what sort of society we want in relation to media ownership, plurality and diversity. The policies Mr Howard signed up to in 1991 but has abandoned now are important policies. The concern people are entitled to have about why between 1991 and 1995 there has been this profound change is an issue that the Australian people are entitled to get an answer to from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and eventually they will get it. But one thing we all know is that this motion will not help them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have canvassed some of this material in the previous debate. I want to make clear that when I began this call for a re-opening of the inquiry it was very clear that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had made serious allegations. Since the time I made this call he has been unable to produce evidence. There is one reality that I think we ought to consider here, and that is that it is likely that not much will come out of an invitation to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) to provide evidence. Nevertheless, I think it is important that we say to them, `You've made these allegations. They are serious allegations. Here's your opportunity to provide the evidence.' But we have to be realistic about what, from the committee's point of view, may come out of such an action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I regret about this motion is that it does not refer to media policy. I have a press release from Senator Alston with the headline `Labor's media ownership shambles'. It quite accurately chronicles the sort of ad hoc approach to media policy that has characterised&mdash;unfortunately, I think, because it is such an important policy area&mdash;the Labor government in recent years. The last paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Barry Jones is dead right I suspect that Paul Keating would not have it any other way. The current policy vacuum enables him to base media ownership decision on personalities and prejudices, rather than any clearly espoused policy principles.</PARA>
<PARA>I say that applies to the opposition as well: there is a huge policy vacuum. It may have been more appropriate, and I need to give some more thought to this, to have included a term of reference which said we should look at the changes that have happened in the last 10 years in particular which obviously necessitate a revisit to communications policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, I think I should clear up something that Senator Alston and others are saying. It seems to have gained currency the idea that the minister for communications is required to have a review of the entire area of communications policy in 1997. But in fact all he has to do&mdash;due to our previous debate I think this is because of a Democrat amendment&mdash;is have a review into a possible fourth TV licence and Australian drama content on pay TV. There is no absolute requirement for the minister to do anything more than that. It would be wise of him to broaden it, but I think we are all standing around in an expectation that he is required to do it when he is not. I think that is one factual point that needs to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about media policy, I join with the comments of Senator McMullan. When Mr Costello has made reference on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> to the role of the anti-monopoly provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the way in which the coalition would seek to protect media plurality using that mechanism, I need to make a couple of points. This would not prevent cross-media ownership because the Trade Practices Commission regards the commercial TV and print media markets as separate. Also, relying on that mechanism may or may not prevent further concentration within the commercial television market&mdash;for example, the acquisition of Channel 9 by Channel 10. There is so much that is open to misinterpretation and exploitation in this area of communications policy that I foreshadow that I certainly want to talk to Senator Alston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we meet with, if we write to, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications and the Arts, invite them to provide evidence and they provide nothing, then where does that get us? It probably says: politicians should not go around making serious allegations which they cannot back up, and that is a point worth making. Policy has been a focus of the previous committee. We talked a lot about foreign ownership policy. We talked about the history of media policy in this country. I feel very strongly that if Minister Lee does not conduct a review of the whole area, then somebody has to. Somebody has to draw all these threads together and say: `Let us have an end to the ad hockery. Let us get policy in place so that we cannot find ourselves revisiting the allegations of deals, because it will not be possible to make deals if we get the rules right.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are waiting on, I think, an ABA determination of Mr Packer's position. The ABA could decide that Mr Packer can go to a 24.8 per cent stake in Fairfax. It might conclude that; we do not know. But that draws attention to another huge defect in the policy&mdash;the whole notion of what constitutes control. We looked at that in our previous committee. It is an issue which has not been resolved. When Senator Faulkner and others raised the point about the committee not having met, as I recall it the reason that we have not presented a final report is that one of our terms of reference is to respond to the government's response to our initial report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Willis, the Treasurer, is on the record as saying that he believes changes have to be made in foreign investment, in the way the Foreign Investment Review Board operates, and that he is going to be making those changes. He said that at a time when our committee was making recommendations on that matter. It is one of the parts of the committee's report where we are in broad agreement&mdash;not detailed agreement but broad agreement. He has not done that yet. The government has not responded to our report. That is why, although we are not meeting, the committee has not concluded. So there are legitimate areas for the committee to either explore or revisit, but we should understand that we may do nothing more under this motion than send a strong message to those in public life who use the media to make strong allegations that this is unacceptable. That is worth doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like us to focus on the longer term issues of media policy in this country because they are in a mess, and we have an opportunity to do something about it. That requires the opposition to clearly state its attitude to media ownership and to cross-media concentration in so far as Mr Packer's position is concerned and what it is prepared to do in the case of a review if we could say to it that the trade practices mechanism simply does not work. There is so much opportunity there to draw those threads together and to use it constructively. This motion does not quite go that far. Senator Alston was out of the chamber. We might need to talk about whether that is a legitimate thing to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government could pull the rug out either from under this committee or from under all the allegations of the Packer-Howard deal by saying, `We are going to legislate next session to tighten up the cross-media rules.'

Senator McMullan, among other things, decided to redefine the word `deal'. He redefined the word `deal'  apparently to cover situations where if there is a mutuality of interest in an outcome therefore there must have, per se, been a deal. In other words, the fact that Senator McMullan and I, for example, might welcome the fact that the Australian Chamber Orchestra should be funded to go overseas and would be pleased to see the Australian Chamber Orchestra do so means we have come to some deal, according to Senator McMullan's eccentric definition of the word `deal' to bring about this outcome. We may well have in fact talked about it both in private conversations and in this chamber, but that does not mean we have come to a deal to deliver. Senator McMullan clearly is clutching at incredible straws and it establishes the absolute nonsense of the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was even worse about Senator McMullan's attempt to defend the government's position was his nonsensical thuggery, in effect, whereby he said to the opposition, `Unless you agree with the government's policy, you have no integrity in this matter.' It is absolute nonsense. He says that we have to state that, in fact, we would not allow Mr Packer to acquire further holdings in the Fairfax group. We have to state that clearly we would not allow that to happen and that if we fail to do so it therefore means we have come to a deal.

Certainly, in the House of Representatives yesterday, Labor ministers were running around trying to redefine the word `deal', as Senator McMullan did here today.

The deal was that if Mr Keating was satisfied with the sort of cover that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> group, under Mr Black, gave to the Labor Party in the election&mdash;I do not know how you define Mr Keating's satisfaction&mdash;</PARA>

It was an absolutely disgraceful non-stop collection of politically oriented articles. In any event, can I say that, unlike the present situation, Mr Keating has been involved in deals regarding the nature of the journalistic cover of his party in the run-up to an election. It was the most disgraceful sort of deal that one could possibly have.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr McGuinness, in his column in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, deals with this authoritarian approach by Mr Keating. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By his recent treatment of the Governor-General, especially the studied insult of not inviting him to the 50th anniversary ceremony at the Canberra War Memorial, the Prime Minister has made it clear that he does not accept that the head of state comes first in order of precedence. He has of course also sponsored the establishment of a committee on rorting the honours system by taking it out of the Governor-General's office.</PARA>
<PARA>This Fuhrer approach&mdash;doing deals approach, repeating the lies approach, and now wanting to go down the German track, if you like&mdash;just fits a clear authoritarian pattern, a dictatorial style of government, that the Prime Minister continually carries on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are simply asking the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications and the Arts to provide the committee with any evidence they have to support those allegations of a deal. Senator McMullan has now admitted that they will not appear. Senator McMullan said that that demonstrated how ludicrous the committee was and how silly the proposal was.

It is all a question now of trying to drum up some basis for concluding the matters, as those opposite have already done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a debate within this chamber just a few months ago about the nature of changes to the committee system. I recall the strong point was made that there was a need to reform the committee system, as it was put&mdash;to reform it, to double the workload, which is a really clever idea. But that was put in the form and on the basis that we would not need to have select committees. Already today we have seen two new ones being formed.

We see in the papers just day by day, `Cross-media rules&mdash;Howard may let Packer have it all' as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA>Those opposite have had the opportunity to spell out their position. But as Mr Howard has demonstrated on numerous occasions&mdash;and as those opposite have said&mdash;his attitude is that he is opposed to the cross-media laws as they currently exist. He is a market sort of person, as he says again and again and again. What he has is a position where he is committed to that policy&mdash;and he is committed on the basis that that is what he believes to be the way forward. That is fine. That is a political position he takes. I give him credit for making it clear what the Liberal Party position really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do we see from the opposition spokesman on this matter though? We see:</PARA>

<PARA>What a farce, what an absolute farce! When the Fairfax committee brought down the majority report, we saw that it brought down all sorts of conclusions about foreign investment procedures, as were seen by the non-government members of that committee. What we saw then in the press conference immediately after the release of that report was Senator Alston saying, `Hang on a minute, this doesn't actually bind the coalition, it doesn't bind the shadow cabinet to any position.' Of course, that is the way it will always be, won't it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly the Liberal Party is very concerned about the exposure that it has had to face on this matter.

Why is it that Mr Howard cannot manage to stand up to Mr Packer? Why is it that they cannot manage the tough decisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that they find it so difficult to come to a position on communications? With the cable regulations, the government made very clear its capacity to make the tough decisions to protect the public interests when it dealt with such matters as the Optus Vision consortium. Why is it that the coalition is so terrified of facing up to those issues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw with Senator Alston today that the coalition is looking at toughening its attitude. It always looks. It gets the big mirror out and has a look into it. For the last eight years the coalition media policy has been under review. Why is it that there is a straight cover of their policy of abolition? That is their policy&mdash;abolition of any cross-media rules to protect the public interest, to protect diversity and to protect the cultural integrity of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this committee goes through its paces, as it inevitably will, I will pursue a few things as well. I want to know whether Mr Little Johnny Howard, Mr Honest Johnny Howard, as we heard before, or Senator Alston has given Mr Packer or any of his executives any understanding that a Howard government would weaken or abolish the cross-media laws. Why is it that Mr Howard was not even capable of giving a straight answer on whether or not he had had a conservation with Mr Packer on the cross-media rules after he became the leader?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was it that Senator Alston offered a different explanation, that there was indeed a conversation? Of course, the cross-media rules were not ever raised. Why is it that Mr Howard initially denied speaking to Mr Packer after resuming the leadership and then later admitted that he had spoken to him about these questions? Why is it that Mr Howard's position, as outlined in the petition of 1991, has changed from the position he has taken today? Why is it that the coalition policy has taken some eight years to review, and the coalition has not come up with any definitive answers other than to say that it is seeking to abolish the cross-media rules altogether?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the coalition is so concerned to protect diversity, why is it that the coalition spokesman was the only significant player to support Mr Packer's claims about the cable network? Why is it that we have seen the coalition run from this very simple matter? Senator Baume today put the proposition that the coalition will not be hassled by making policies available to the Australian public. Why does it pursue such cynical and nakedly opportunistic policies in such a way as to avoid its responsibilities to come clean and to explain what its attitudes are to these important matters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee will not produce any new material. It will not produce anything of value that will add to the question of policy debate that I think all of us wish to see. We may in fact wish to see a proper debate comparing in an objective way the coalition's policy with the government's policy. Let the public make that decision, as they undoubtedly will. Ultimately, that process will not be advanced by another one of these bogus, politically biased and prejudiced committees like this Fairfax committee. It has been discredited. It has not met for five months. It has no secretariat. One asks the question: what sorts of benefits have been picked up on the way through? It has not done any work for five months. Why do we go back to this committee? In terms of its original terms of reference it cannot be justified, other than that. Through this committee, the coalition is looking for a platform which it controls to advance its sordid political interests. </PARA>

I note that John Howard called him Dr Goebbels and Senator Baume this morning promoted him to the Fuhrer. Although that is colourful, the real essence of the message is that there is no place in a democracy for this sort of authoritarian behaviour. There is no place in a democracy for the sort of political thuggery that we have seen in the last two weeks.

I put it to Senator Burns and Senator Collins that no-one is fair game in this sort of situation. In a democracy, prime ministers have an enormous amount of power and they should not use that power in this way. The Prime Minister has used this power across the full range from Kerry Packer to the humblest journalist. A journalist gets a phone call, `It is the Prime Minister on the line.' The Prime Minister then roars down the phone at that journalist. Senator Alston provided evidence of this. It involves distinguished journalists like Alan Ramsay and Laura Tingle.

From the debate this morning, it is obvious that the government has absolutely no evidence on this matter. Why does it not have any evidence? It does not exist. It is as simple as that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put this into perspective and bring the Prime Minister to account in this country. We will be delighted when the Prime Minister returns. We will be delighted when he is back in question time. We will be delighted when the press has a chance to question him. As an opposition, we will be even more delighted to question him again. What he should do in regard to this particular matter is put up and shut up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has no evidence and the huge irony is that he is accusing the Leader of the Opposition of making deals. That has got to be the greatest joke coming from the prince of deals in this country. That is another pattern of behaviour of this Prime Minister. If we go back to his pre-selection at the age of 26 for the seat of Bankstown, we find that it is on the public record how he rorted his pre-selection. He should not be here. He did not get the vote until they changed it in a rather unusual way and he suddenly won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go through to the classic case in Australian political history of the secret deal at Kirribilli House&mdash;another deal maker. Coming closer to home and to this media issue, in Conrad Black's book we read about balanced coverage. That, of course, is code. Someone was using the word `code' earlier; I think it was Senator McMullan. It was stated, `We will increase your foreign stake if you provide balanced coverage.' In other words, `Give us a better run and we will give you more media ownership.' If that is not the classic deal in Australian political history, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter was brought before the Senate print media inquiry. The Prime Minister was invited to appear. Of course, with his usual arrogance, he refused to do so. That is why, in this motion, we are asking for that committee to be reconvened. If the Prime Minister has any evidence&mdash;he is too arrogant to appear before a Senate committee&mdash;let us ask him to put his evidence in writing and then we will consider that evidence in an objective way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we must do in this country if democracy is to survive is get rid of these sorts of things that bring the whole process into disrepute. We have the sixth oldest democracy in the world. Democracy is a very fragile condition. In the whole sweep of human history it has been here for only a very short time and there is no guarantee that it will stay. The thing that will bring democracy down in the end will be cynicism in government&mdash;the sorts of deals that this Prime Minister has done and the sorts of silly, baseless accusations that he has made against innocent people. This sort of behaviour has to stop. If it does stop, it may raise the standard of politics in this country and democracy might have a better chance of surviving. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I would like to tell Senator Tierney the one thing we need in a democracy: some diversity in terms of the ownership of the media. John Howard has provided the proof that that is something he is not going to provide in government. People are concentrating on secret deals. John Howard has provided all the evidence that anyone would need that this deal has been done with the Packer organisation. He provided it last night on the Packer channel&mdash;Channel 9.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how anyone could watch John Howard's slippery-slidey performance delivered last night on Channel 9 and call him `Honest John'. For Senator Tierney's information, he might like to remember how Honest John got the nickname `Honest John'. It has been lost in the mists of time. It was  not because he was honest. I think it was the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> that carried the headline, `Lies, lies, lies'. The word `honest' was put in quotation marks. It was ironically applied to Honest John because he had reneged, when he was Treasurer, on every single commitment he had made that would not appear in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who could forget the most spectacular performance of all. As the outgoing Treasurer, knowing perfectly well that he was leaving behind what, in today's terms, was an enormous deficit of over $9 billion, John Howard looked straight down the barrel of a television camera in the election campaign and told everyone that it was going to be $6 billion. He knew that if he told the truth it would not only defeat his party but also blow it out of the water. So Honest John does not have a real good reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he excelled himself last night on the Packer-owned Channel 9 program by confirming again that what he told Mr Packer in private is what he has been saying publicly and the two things are exactly the same. I agree with him; they are the same. He said on Channel 9 last night that he does not believe in the cross-media rules. He said on Channel 9 last night that his public position is that he has no objection to one organisation&mdash;forget Kerry Packer, do not personalise this, do not put a name on it, you do not have to&mdash;controlling all of the major media, everything we see and read, in one region. That is exactly what he told Kerry Packer in private. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I confirm that, in public, John Howard has provided all the evidence and he will not do anything else. The Packer organisation knows that a Howard government will not stop it buying Fairfax, because Howard said it publicly. So it will control not only the major television channel in one market but also the major newspaper, and John Howard will not stop it. He confirmed it last night on the Packer-owned Channel 9 program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, do not personalise this. I have nothing against Kerry Packer. Good luck to him if he is the richest man in Australia. I could not care less about that, but I do have an objection, like Senator Kernot has an objection, to one organisation owning all of the major media in one region. Our country has the most concentrated media ownership of any country. I deeply regret that. In a country like Great Britain, particular newspapers are known to have a Labour bias and others are known to have a Tory bias, and everyone in the country knows it. They know they get a diverse range of opinion from what they read in newspapers because newspapers are clearly identified as being middle of the road or having a right wing bias or a left wing bias. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, regrettably most of the major media is owned by a very small number of companies. They say these cross-media rules will not work. Why all the fuss if they do not work? Why all the screaming and yelling from the Packer organisation if they do not work? I will tell senators why: because they do work and because they effectively stop the Packer organisation controlling the major television channels in one region and the major newspapers in the same region. Those rules work, and that is why those companies are screaming about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the alternative government saying about that? The leader has said that he is opposed to those cross-media limitations. In other words, he does not need a private meeting with Mr Packer or anyone else&mdash;he has told Mr Packer on the public record as well as in private. John Howard has provided all the evidence anyone needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to look at what use a media owner can make of his own media organisation, do not go past the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> interview with Mr Packer on Channel 9. I have great regard for Ray Martin; I have high regard for Ray Martin. I think Ray Martin has made a significant contribution in assisting the drought affected farmers of this country with the Farmhand appeal, but I have to tell you&mdash;it took a pretty strong stomach to watch the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> interview on this issue with Mr Packer on Mr Packer's own television program. When Ray asked Mr Packer what his thoughts were about becoming, first, Prime Minister of Australia and, second, to top that off, Australia's first president, I really had to reach for the sick bag. It was getting a bit strong. Everyone saw that interview. Everyone saw proof positive of the necessity to have at least a different opinion going in somewhere rather than having that sycophantic stuff. I mean, President Packer&mdash;fair crack of the whip!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that one of the important things, Senator Tierney, about any democratic society is that there is some diversity in the ownership of the media. There is some diversity in what people can read and see. We say there should be. The Australian Democrats say there should be. You say there does not need to be. That is the big difference between the two approaches. John Howard, your leader, is on the public record as saying that he does not support the cross-media rules. In other words, not only has he told Mr Packer privately; he has told Mr Packer publicly that, as far as a Howard government is concerned, Mr Packer can own everything. He can have the newspapers in a region and the television channels in that region as well. More proof is not needed. John Howard once again provided it in spades on the Packer-owned Channel 9 program last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe that, if the cross-media rules were not working, they would not be provoking the complaints we are getting right now. The fact is that they are provoking complaints, and where are those complaints coming from? From the organisation that wants to own everything in one region&mdash;something which is being prevented by these rules. I condemn the opposition as an Australian, not a Labor politician, for giving comfort to having those rules removed, for providing for a situation where we have an even greater concentration of media ownership in Australia than we have now and for giving Kerry Packer the green light publicly to be able to own all of the major newspapers and the major television channels in one area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you wanted a recent demonstration of the difficulty with allowing that, you do not need to look any further than the Packer organisation's own television channels and the run they have been giving their owner on this issue over the last few weeks. It has been sycophantic in the extreme. I do not think any Australian is better off for that. There are big differences between the two choices available to Australians at the next election on this issue of media ownership. This government has a view that it is undesirable for any of us in a democracy to have that situation, and you, Senator Tierney, are going to support it happening, and your leader has put the opposition's support for it on the record to his eternal shame. </PARA>

It is all very well for him to say that this is his intent, but I believe it should be put in place much better. That came through in one consultation that Senator Burns had with one of the state authorities. That state authority was the Rural Finance Corporation in Victoria. It said of this unintended consequence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The non-state component of the RAS is not confined to regional RAS. According to our reading of the bill, the proposed amendment will allow payments for any purpose under the scheme to be made by this mechanism. This would enable the Commonwealth to bypass states altogether and would cut across the general thrust of the scheme as it has operated for over 20 years; that is, that funding be handled by state authorities with the experience and knowledge to gain the best possible result for the funding available.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps there is a good explanation for that, but I do not think it has been properly explained to us. That is why Senator Crane and I agree that, in relation to the powers conferred, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) should clarify the matter. The Senate, however, has considered that the bill must be amended to give effect to the stated intention. The rest of the committee has said that it would basically just like an explanation. We want it put into the legislation so that there is no further concern about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that concerns me&mdash;we pointed it out in the report&mdash;is that it is imperative for regional adjustment to occur from the grassroots level up and not be imposed from above. Regional RAS will be successful only if it emanates from an area that wants to adjust all together in a similar way to south-west Queensland. Let us look at it as an example. It was done by the locals through the state government and then the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth came in and gave the funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is nothing wrong with regional RAS or adjustment. We said that we commend it in our recent report. But I would not like to see the Commonwealth government imposing on an area the need to readjust. For example, it has been suggested that the Commonwealth would like to do some regional adjusting in the western division of New South Wales. I believe that it is up to the people there whether they want to adjust. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, that will be explained, Minister. That was our other concern. I would also hope&mdash;we could get this explained or even put into the legislation&mdash;that the states would still be consulted and not just bypassed. Otherwise, we would most probably find that the Commonwealth would be annexing a part of a state because it would basically be the sole provider of money for that adjustment to the area. I say that a little bit tongue in cheek, although it has not hurt my tongue too much. We have to be careful that the explanations are right so that we do not put the wrong slant on the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the bill came before our committee, our constitutional concerns were raised. For example, if the Commonwealth started to administer at the grassroots level, at the state level, then there could be a problem with constitutionality. Apparently, that has been fixed up. Even at this stage, the federal government gives money directly to individuals within states via farm household support and other welfare measures. But I believe this inquiry has achieved a fair bit. It has made the bill a little bit clearer to some people. I hope that, when the minister replies after Senator Crane has spoken, he will clarify some of these issues and tell us that he is going to amend the bill and fix the matter due to my concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to make some comments about the motion moved by Senator Burns concerning the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. The first point I want to make is that I strongly favour in certain circumstances a regional approach to RAS. What concerns me&mdash;I understand we are getting amendments which we will have to make a judgment on when they come forward&mdash;is that, on examination, this was all-embracing legislation. On examination, what was in the second reading speech did not reflect what was proposed in the amendments to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to point the finger at somebody for that happening. Was it the department which prepared the second reading speech and the amendments? Did the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) deliberately come in here to deceive this chamber? I do not believe he did. Nonetheless, these questions have to be put on the public record because, when we examined this piece of legislation, we discovered that what was in the second reading speech and what was proposed in the amendments did not reflect each other. That is a well-known fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech during the second reading debate, I deliberately put a series of questions on the public record to give the departmental officers the opportunity to prepare responses before they appeared before the committee. I appreciate the pressures placed upon them by us. But, for whatever reason, they chose not to deal with the questions I raised in my speech during the second reading debate. Before the committee they went into discussions on the legislation without an opening statement. I found that very disappointing. In fact, I could go so far as to say that it was a dereliction of their duty to this chamber. We came in here and asked those questions so that the departmental officers could look at them. We asked those questions in a genuine endeavour to improve the legislation and make it better understood, but the departmental officers ignored them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw the attention of honourable senators to a couple of questions I asked in my speech. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it the intention, for example, to gradually phase them out?</PARA>
<PARA>I was talking about the various state rural adjustment arrangements or schemes. Certainly, under the legislation that was before us, that could have been done. I believe that I asked a valid and fair question at that time. But, for whatever reason, the departmental officers chose to ignore it. Further in my speech I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and I give notice to the people from the department who are coming to that committee, that we need to have some very specific, precise answers to some of the things that have been raised here.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to put on the public record that the officers from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy chose not to address those issues in a formal manner when they appeared before the committee, and I find that very disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to go to the issue of consultation with the states. I note from what Senator Brownhill said that Senator Collins said that it would not work unless there was a grassroots approach to the whole matter. I think we all acknowledge that. But, once again, if that were really the intent, then I think some more homework should have been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly wish to quote from a letter from the Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation in Western Australia. That letter sums up, particularly for Western Australia and, I understand, some other states, that there was, at best, very little consultation. I do acknowledge that we were given information that there were discussions with Queensland&mdash;and there is a scheme in Queensland already&mdash;and also it would appear that there were more in-depth discussions with South Australia. The Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation in Western Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practical terms, the involvement of RAS in rural area development will inevitably require in-depth consultation and support from the grassroots up.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a point that we have already made. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst assurances about continued consultation with States over RAS initiatives has been given in evidence to the Senate Committee by Commonwealth officials, the Corporation questions the necessity for the Commonwealth to seek such open ended powers. The Western Australian Government would have serious reservations about conferring any such open ended powers on the Commonwealth which would enable it to intrude into matters that are seen to be of particular interest and responsibility of the State. It is a strong advocate of a co-operative approach to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the second matter of direct payments to organisations rather than farmers, the Corporation has sought amendments to the Commonwealth "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">policy guidelines</EMPHASIS>", particularly in relation to the administration of RAS Skill Enhancement Program, to allow the Corporation to make direct payments to organisations delivering skill development or training courses to farmers. The current policy guidelines require the State administering bodies to provide financial support to farmers. The flexibility being sought will offer administration cost reductions for the reasons outlined to the Senate Committee by officers of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy . . . and ensure more of the limited moneys for normal RAS programs available to support farmers rather than unnecessary administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mechanics of achieving the flexibility have not been discussed in any detail by the Commonwealth with the State. The Corporation is unaware of whether amendments to the policy guidelines or the Act would be necessary to extend this flexibility to State administering bodies. It is not a matter on which the Corporation has sought legal advice, and has initially sought endorsement of the principle with the mechanics of how this would be achieved to be resolved subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA>I put to the minister this particular query about flexibility and what exists currently in the states and ask: does it actually extend to the programs that are being administered by the states?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making those comments, I re-emphasise the particular points that I made about the necessity for a grassroots approach, the necessity to recognise the responsibilities of the states in terms of land management, and I put on the public record that, unless there are detailed discussions with the states about how this is going to operate, how the various processes for regional reconstruction are going to occur, then this legislation, the intent of which I believe is right, will be doomed to failure. </PARA>

<PARA>I initially gave notice of this reference on 9 February, exactly one month ago. I have postponed consideration of this matter twice to enable senators to have more time to consider the issues, but it is a pressing matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people who live in the area surrounding the proposed powerline are extremely concerned about Eastlink and have been pushing strongly for a Senate inquiry. They have been very unhappy with the lack of consultation with state governments and the apparent inadequate consideration of many aspects of Eastlink. The Senate has already received well over 2,000 signatures from people in the area asking for the Senate to inquire into the matter. As it is a matter that involves at least two states, it is appropriate that the Senate do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition members from Queensland Mr Bruce Scott and Mr Bill Taylor have publicly expressed support for an inquiry, and the National Party at state level has expressed total opposition to Eastlink. I hope coalition and government senators will support my motion so that the Senate is able to fulfil its role as a chamber of review and a chamber which ensures that governments are accountable for the decisions they make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge a reply from Senator Ian Macdonald to my request to consider this matter. I understand that the coalition prefers to wait for a briefing to be given to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. I need to point out that that briefing itself has been delayed twice&mdash;firstly, because of the tragic death of Senator Zakharov and, secondly, because a briefing set to take place yesterday was cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to tell the Senate that, while all of this is going on, the state government in Queensland in particular has been simply sailing ahead. In media reports in Queensland in recent days, the Queensland government has made statements such as, `We do not care what the Senate says'&mdash;particularly referring to the 1992 report of the Senate&mdash;`We are simply going to go ahead.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this wide ranging inquiry will look at all the issues, not just the ones which will be given in a briefing to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Referencdes Committee, and especially those which are of concern to the people who will be affected. In drawing the Senate's attention to the terms of reference, I need just to underline that they refer to concerns about the health of people and animals in the area; the vegetation and overall environment; the social fabric and local economic viability of surrounding communities, including the likely loss of agricultural land; and the adequacy of the consultation process undertaken by government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will place on the record just a couple of examples of the concerns had by local farmers in the area. Judy Whistler, one of the people in the area, has written to me and said that she was approached by a local cattle property owner who has a stud farm. He has been advised that buyers are being scared off by the idea of having powerlines near his $30,000 stud bulls. He sells these bulls all over the world and exports their semen. Terry Larsen of TOTA has relayed information that some feedlot farmers have been told by Koreans and Japanese that they will not buy their stock if the powerline is built on properties near the stock. These situations indicate that there is great uncertainty amongst the communities being affected. This is not being alleviated by the state governments in either Queensland or New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has a clear role to play. It should act now and not delay further, because this is simply dragging out the concerns of these people. I would point out that it is not simply a matter of being against something; there are many possibilities to be opened up for alternative energy. I would also point out that a recent press report spoke of a wind farm in Western Australia which has created $700,000 worth of savings in energy costs in the first year of operation, according to energy minister Colin Barnett. I would place on record that there are alternatives. People are opposed to the Eastlink powerline going ahead. The implications of Eastlink will mean higher greenhouse gas emissions because it will be using Hunter Valley stations rather than the new gas-fired plants in Queensland. The people in northern New South Wales, southern Queensland and increasingly in Brisbane see Eastlink as an environmental issue. The community sees itself being forced to pay in reduced land values, health risks, et cetera, for a project that will subsidise future power station owners. The unpopularity of the project is overwhelmingly clear. I seek the support of the Senate for the motion relating to this reference. </PARA>

The government does not believe that a Senate inquiry would be appropriate for a number of reasons&mdash;namely, many of the concerns that have been outlined by Senator Woodley in his motion revolve around environmental considerations. The formal environmental impact statement process is yet to commence, and we would expect that many of the problem areas would be resolved when the EIS goes on display in mid-November 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Commonwealth government's viewpoint, the fact is that New South Wales and Queensland have prime jurisdictional responsibility for Eastlink, with state utilities having the required technical expertise and day to day management over the feasibility study, and the final decision to build Eastlink rests solely with the states. The Commonwealth has supported consideration being given to the construction of Eastlink as an early option in helping Queensland's future electricity supply needs and as a major component in the creation of a competitive multistate electricity market. The Commonwealth has certainly encouraged the assessment of the Eastlink proposal and agreed to contribute up to $7 million in the funding of a feasibility study over the period 1993-94 to 1995-96. The Commonwealth funding is to be matched by both the New South Wales and the Queensland governments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Prawn Promotion Association was formed four years ago to address the decline in Australia's market share and earnings. This decline, caused mainly by competition in overseas markets from aquacultured prawns, is a major concern for this industry, which earns some $197 million a year in export income. Given the importance of these earnings and the precarious state of our balance of trade, it is commendable that the prawn industry is taking matters into its own hands. The Australian Prawn Promotion Association began by seeking federal government assistance to increase the export value of sea-caught prawns, particularly in the important Asian markets. The association has now developed a self-help strategy that aims to promote its product in innovative ways as well as differentiate Australian sea-caught prawns from the overseas farmed product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In turn, the federal government has agreed to collect funds for the scheme by means of a prawn boat levy and prawn export charge.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The following groups have agreed to this levy:  the National Fishing Industry Council; the Queensland Commercial Fishermen's Association; the Western Australian Northern Trawler Operators Association; the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council; the Australian Fisheries Management Authority; the Spencer Gulf Association of South Australia; the Shark Bay Association of Western Australia; and the Northern Prawn Fisheries Queensland Trawl Association. The money collected by the Commonwealth will be paid to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation to promote sea-caught prawns or product of such prawns. All promotional activities will require approval from the Australian Prawn Promotion Association Ltd on behalf of its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of levy will be determined by the Australian Prawn Promotion Association and prescribed by regulation. However, the maximum permissible amount of levy per boat is $75 for a ship less than 10 metres, $150 for a ship more than 10 metres but less than 15 metres, $300 for a ship more than 15 metres but less than 18 metres, and $750 in the case of a ship not less than 18 metres. The amount of export charge is not to exceed 10c a kilogram of the net weight of the sea-caught prawns. There will be an exemption for exporters who export less than 5,000 kilograms of sea-caught prawns or their product in a financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the shadow minister for primary industry, Mr John Anderson, noted in the other place recently, there is occasional debate about the appropriateness of industries imposing levies on themselves. In other words, there is concern that the industries effectively bind all their members, irrespective of differences in views. But the evidence is that, where these schemes are properly conducted and accountable, the benefits to industry participants and to Australia's economic performance represent a substantial improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation has, in the coalition's view, benefited enormously from the research and development grant arrangements that now apply to virtually all of our primary industries. These approaches have enjoyed bipartisan support, and I hope that will continue to be the case. The coalition therefore supports this package of bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague Senator Tambling has clearly and concisely indicated the coalition's position on these bills. I do not need to reiterate what my colleague has said. However, I would like to do something that I do not often do, and that is to be just a fraction parochial in a couple of very brief comments. The prawn industry is very important to Queensland generally and particularly to north Queensland. It provides lots of jobs and a lot of export dollars for Australia and, importantly, for north and far north Queensland and the gulf areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many communities rely on the prawn industry for their very existence and continuation. Certainly, the prawn industry is very important to the gulf area, and it is similarly the case right along the coast of far north Queensland. I think I can say without fear of challenge in this place that north Queensland prawns are amongst the tastiest in the world. They are really a magnificent product. I see that Senator Boswell is going to speak, and I am quite sure that he will elaborate on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly mention the viability of commercial fishing, including prawn trawlers, in Cooktown. That viability is being held back because the port at Cooktown is too shallow to allow larger boats in. Whilst recreational vessels can access the port using tides, commercial vessels running to schedules and deadlines cannot. On 7 July this year, the $17 million replica of the bark <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endeavour</EMPHASIS>, which will be touring the east coast of Australia on an historic journey marking the 225th anniversary of Captain Cook's voyage, will be unable to access the port of Cooktown. This is where the original <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endeavour</EMPHASIS> spent 47 days way back in the very early days of white settlement of Australia. The new <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endeavour</EMPHASIS> replica will be unable to access the port because it is too shallow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite several representations from the people of Cooktown, the Queensland government has refused to dredge the area because of yet to be substantiated environmental concerns. The harbour has been dredged previously. Hydrographic surveys show that, while the low tide mark is presently 1.2 metres, in 1991 it was 1.4 metres and in 1949 it was 2.7 metres. The dredging of the harbour would involve removing approximately 200,000 cubic metres of silt from an area 700 metres long by 100 metres wide and three metres deep at a cost of around $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As senators would know, Cooktown is a viable port for maritime tourism and commercial fishing. However, these industries have not been able to expand. In fact, tourism visits will be reduced this year because of inadequate access to the port. A proposal has been made to enter the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endeavour </EMPHASIS>off Grassy Hill in Cooktown and to ferry residents out to the ship to have a look at it. This is unacceptable as the transportation process would be unsafe; there would be unrealistic weather expectations; and the ship will, of necessity, be anchored one kilometre offshore in deep and exposed waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the federal government will get involved in this by undertaking immediate environmental assessments on the effect of dredging on the surrounding environment of the port of Cooktown to ensure that it occurs in an environmentally sound manner in time for the visit of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endeavour</EMPHASIS>. It would also open up the port of Cooktown to allow for the area's expansion of tourism and prawn fishing operating out of the port of Cooktown. With those few remarks, I again support what Senator Tambling has said and indicate that the coalition will be supporting these bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Ian Macdonald's statement that the trawling and prawning industry is most important for the Torres Strait, the gulf and North Queensland. We are debating three bills&mdash;the Prawn Boat Levy Bill 1994, the Prawn Export Charge Bill 1994 and the Prawn Export Promotion Bill 1994. These bills will introduce research and development funding for the fishing industry&mdash;funding that will be used for the promotion of prawn exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative for a promotion fund for the export of prawns came from the industry through the Australian Prawn Promotion Association. It will be an industry funded, self-help promotional fund. Its main benefit will be to promote the export and development of sea-caught Australian prawns, particularly into the Asian market. Promotion is seen by the industry as an essential tool to expanding its export markets. Australian sea-caught prawns will have the benefit in the international markets of being superior quality prawns that have been caught in pristine and very clean and green Australian seas. The industry is to be congratulated on its initiative in coming together to promote its excellent product and to expand its export markets to the ultimate benefit of the industry and Australian export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy consists of two parts. The first part is an annual levy imposed on the owners of commercial prawn boats, which increases with the size of the ship. The second part is a charge imposed on sea-caught prawns or their products which is paid by the exporter. At this point, I pay tribute to the fishermen of North Queensland for their commitment to the concept of promotion. Queensland boat owners will be making a large contribution to the $0.5 million promotion fund because of the larger proportion of boats in Queensland than in other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 475 DPI registered boats, 370 come from Queensland ports. The contribution will no doubt be a double impost on the fishermen as the further contribution will inevitably fall on the fishermen through the levy imposed on the exporting processes being passed through to the producer, the fisherman. The industry will endeavour to use this new prawn promotion fund to promote sea-caught prawn exports in the most effective way. It is significant that, due to the foresight of the industry in setting up this fund, it will be in a position to compete in the near future when Taiwan and China work through their present problems with prawn farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to address the Senate more generally on the issue of rural research and development and the concerns of rural industry at the suggested cuts to rural research and development contained in the draft report of the Industry Commission. The Industry Commission report suggests a scaling down of the government's rural research and development contribution from the present dollar for dollar contribution equally from the industry and the government to the industry being required to contribute $4 for every $1 from the government. I speak on behalf of all primary industries when I say that this is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having established the highly productive regime of rural research and development over recent years and having seen the benefit it contributes, it would be ludicrous for the government to accept the recommendation of the Industry Commission. For the government to put its budget concerns ahead of the real financial returns that flow from rural research and development would be totally short-sighted. In a country like Australia, rural research and development should be treated like a sacred cow. The scientific advances and the opportunities for scientists to contribute within Australia to the rural industry development that has arisen from rural R&amp;D funds have been enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government matching rural R&amp;D funding schemes has helped all rural industries, ranging from large ones such as the grain industry through to small horticulture industries. It has further provided a vehicle for industries to increase their R&amp;D funding to the scheme target of 0.05 per cent of gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To cut any funding by three-quarters would bring an enormous amount of research to a standstill. The small banana industry, important to Queensland and northern New South Wales, says that a reduction of this magnitude would see their R&amp;D programs come to an abrupt halt and many valuable projects would have to be shelved. The banana industry rightly sees the government contribution to R&amp;D funding as an investment not as a support and, by observing their present R&amp;D projects, it illustrates that many public benefits will flow from this R&amp;D funding. I refer to projects such as specific disease control which prevents the use of chemicals which, in turn, do so much costly damage to our rivers and waterways. Research and development benefits the consumer through increased yield and it has to proceed in our rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting these bills, and the initiative of the fishing industry in setting up their own prawn export promotion fund, I applaud the initiative and planning of the Australian fishing industry. Having regard to the benefits to both specific industries and the public, I also call on the government to listen to all other rural industries and continue the existing R&amp;D funding arrangements. </PARA>

I did note that a couple of senators strayed into other areas not directly related to the legislation. Senator Boswell's comments about the Industry Commission draft report are noted. However, he understands that all the industries now have an opportunity to comment on the draft report. Those agricultural research organisations and corporations that he mentions can certainly do that, and I am sure they will take that opportunity. The government will then respond in detail after the final report is tabled. It is a report that covers many areas of R&amp;D.

Blainey claims democracy was healthier 40 to 60 years ago, yet this was the time when our indigenous people could not vote, when women had to leave the Public Service when they married, when the white Australia policy was flourishing and when only British subjects automatically had a say in how the country was run without Australian citizenship.</PARA>

They come here because of the values and principles that Senator McKiernan talked about and I have outlined and because they will not be condemned to a life of second-class citizens or, worst still, non-citizens. The discriminatory policy that Professor Blainey talks about does operate. It does exist in other countries. It has been directly responsible for the creation of underclasses and ugly racial division in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan referred to the global cultural diversity conference to be held in Sydney in April. Australia's inclusive multicultural policies and its inclusive citizenship policies will be showcased at that conference as one of the fundamentals of our success. We do make citizenship available to people after two years permanent residence. Blainey of course is wrong to suggest they can be away for 12 months of that time. When people make that commitment, we do not ask them to assume a monocultural mantle and leave their religions or cultures behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the government's current citizenship promotion campaign makes it quite clear that citizenship is the common bond which unites all Australians.

It celebrates it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underpinning their pledge is a commitment to English as a common language. That commitment is explicit not only in our national agenda for multicultural Australia but also in the increased level of funding the federal government provides in each year for English language services.

Will you tell the Senate who is telling the truth&mdash;Air Marshal Fisher or minister Brereton? What is the time frame for the closure of the base? What is the estimated cost of the relocation of the base and where is it to be relocated? Will this additional cost be met by a special increase to the defence budget or will it have to be found out of the already diminishing forward estimates?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister in a position to comment on media reports suggesting that the Australian government has abandoned the two Cambodians who helped to recover the remains of Kellie Wilkinson from the Khmer Rouge last year? Is there any truth to these reports? What are the actual circumstances?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very disappointed at the immediate assumption by some media commentators of bad faith on the part of the government in this matter. There has been none at any stage and I hope the terms of my answer now will make that very clear. I will first give some background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation to recover the remains of Kellie Wilkinson and her two British colleagues was one conceived and run by the Cambodian police. The two people whom the government is alleged to have abandoned were working as operatives for the Cambodian police, not for the Australian or British governments. Both Australia and the UK had police from the AFP and New Scotland Yard in Sihanoukville during the investigation into the abduction and murder of Kellie and her friends. Their role was to monitor Cambodian investigations first into what happened to the three and then, when it became unhappily clear that they had almost certainly been murdered, to recover evidence of their death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During these operations, absolutely no commitment to provide moneys for the relocation or reward of the two Cambodian operatives was made by any Australian. I am certainly not aware, either, of any commitment being made by officers from New Scotland Yard. On 1 September, some two weeks after the remains had been recovered, the two operatives approached the British and Australian embassies in Phnom Penh for money to pay for relocation. This was followed up on 13 September by a formal request from the governor of Kampong Som. He sought $US60,000 for each operative for their relocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The request was then considered by the Australian and British governments. It was certainly considered very sympathetically. We were grateful for what the operatives had done in finding and returning the remains. We certainly acknowledged that they had undertaken some significant risks in order to do so. Our embassy accordingly recommended that a sum of money be provided for relocation. That recommendation was supported by the AFP and approved by the Department of Finance on 15 December last year as an act of grace payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was agreed with the British government, taking into account local factors, such as the cost of living and so on&mdash;I will come to that in more detail in a moment&mdash;that the sum to be paid should be $US7,000. The monies were paid to each operative by governments on 19 January. Each operative thus received a total of $US7,000 for relocation costs. At the time, they were required to sign a waiver of further claims, which they did. They were reported at the time to seem satisfied and grateful for the payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be understood that $US7,000 is a lot of money in Cambodia. The average income in the country is only $US214 per annum. Many Cambodians in rural areas, where these chaps come from, would earn much less than this. Civil service and military salaries, for example, are between $15 and $20 per month. Again, as a further example, under the special assistance program, Cambodian refugees who are returned to Cambodia from Australia are paid $250 per family and then given $US30 per adult and $US15 per child per month for the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We checked this morning what we could find out in the short time available about housing relocation costs. Our post tells that us that in Takeo province, which is next to Kampot, a plot of land would cost between $US1,500 and $US4,000, depending on how close it is to a rice field and considerations of that kind. A peasant's house would cost in the order of $2,500. Obviously, land would cost considerably more in the cities and major towns, but clearly $7,000 is a lot of purchasing power in a Cambodian context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should finally point out that the publicity surrounding this affair will hardly contribute to the safety of the two operatives, if that indeed is their primary concern. The publicity has included their photographs and the addresses at which they now live, thereby destroying any chance of anonymity and undermining their security. The whole point of any relocation would have been to safeguard them, not expose them to the world. So those who are minded to assume bad faith on the part of the Australian and UK governments might perhaps now be prepared to ask some questions about the motivations of those who have gone public in this way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It ought to be understood the extent to which the cross-media rules are already embodied in legislation. The basic 15 per cent rule is contained in the Broadcasting Services Act. That means that newspaper proprietors, commercial television proprietors and commercial radio proprietors in each case cannot control the other media in question if they are associated with the licence area in question. Control is defined in the legislation as being an absence of proof to the contrary that a person who has company interests exceeding 15 per cent is regarded as being in a position to exercise control. It is not uncommon, as Senator Kernot should be better aware than most people, in commercially relevant legislation of this kind to not try to bring any more precision than that into the question of control, because it depends on a multitude of circumstances whether control is capable of being exercised with any given percentage. But all of that is pretty clearly laid out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the foreign ownership rules are concerned, it is the case that only general power is given to FIRB under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. Thereafter, it is mainly a matter of discretion in accordance with guidelines laid down, but with the reference to maximum involvement by a single shareholder being 25 per cent and two or more foreign persons not being permitted to hold more than a 40 per cent aggregate controlling interest as far as newspaper proprietors are concerned. There are similar complex percentage rules so far as commercial television is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that there has been any doubt about what the cross-media rules mean in practice, although there will always be room for argument about what constitutes control at the margin. The doubt has been how seriously committed to those rules the opposition is. There is no doubt about the government's commitment. We have made it clear. If there is a case for embodying some more of this in legislation, I will ask the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications and the Arts if they have anything further to say in response to Senator Kernot's question. But I would not have thought the legislative clarity of the provisions at the moment is a matter in issue. I do not think we have made any plans to introduce further legislation in this respect, but, as I said, I will ask the relevant ministers.</PARA>

You have had this extraordinary commitment to the Trade Practices Act, knowing perfectly well that they are all different markets for the purposes of the Trade Practices Act.

As to your third question about all this benefiting American multinationals, the situation is that, given that our contribution will, as I said, be used for the purchase of heavy oil&mdash;which we do not produce and supply ourselves&mdash;to meet interim energy needs, given that the responsibility for the supply and construction of the reactors lies with KEDO and the ROK will bear the major part of the financial cost, and given that the reactors will be of South Korean origin, Australia's contribution can in no way be interpreted as direct assistance to multinational American companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to your last question, before giving a commitment to contribute, a lot of effort was put into determining what commercial opportunities might be available for Australian energy expertise and technology. However, the final agreement between the US and North Korea specified precisely the kind of energy to be supplied; namely, nuclear plus interim annual supplies of heavy oil. It was a specific negotiated outcome arrived at after some 16 months of intense, very heavy negotiations, and there was not much room for manoeuvre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether solar powered hot-water units would be a viable alternative, let me say this: according to the information supplied by Solarhart Industries and DPIE, two 1,000 megawatt nuclear power plants would produce approximately 12,000 million kilowatt hours of electricity per annum. By way of comparison, one solar water heater would be expected to produce 2,000 kilowatts per annum. Thus, to replace the amount of electricity produced by these nuclear power plants would require approximately six million normal household sized solar hot-water heaters. At a cost of $2,500 per system, these would cost some $15 billion, which is 3 3/4 times the cost of the supply of the reactors themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also needs to be recognised that hot water demand would be a relatively small proportion of current DPRK electricity demands, so there is not direct substitutability. It also needs to be recalled that the hours of direct sunshine in Pyongyang are estimated to be about 5 1/2 per day maximum, which means that solar water heaters would typically require supplementary boosting from alternative energy sources during the winter months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that it would be a big boost to Australian industry if we could sell six million hot-water systems to the North Koreans under this deal that you are proposing. That would, of course, amount to some 200 years of Australian present production, which is at the rate of 30,000 systems annually at the moment. It is nice to know that, in a world of constant change and inconstancy, some things do remain permanent: the Democrats really are the fairies at the bottom of the garden party.</PARA>

Is it not the case that the companies making the nuclear reactors in South Korea are indeed subsidiaries of Westinghouse and General Electric; what really has happened here is that Australia has been put over a barrel using security as the argument so that Australia provides a direct subsidy to American industry; and, even though we are not actually building part of the reactor, the supplies which we are providing do, in fact, go towards that nuclear program?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wet tropics tree planting scheme has been operating with Commonwealth funding since 1989. It was originally established to provide employment for timber workers who were displaced by the cessation of logging in the wet tropics world heritage area. The scheme has been very successful and has a great track record in environmental repair through reducing soil erosion, improving water quality and replacing lost rainforest habitats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the government reconfirmed its commitment to the scheme, providing $3 million over two years to the North Queensland afforestation program joint board. The board, which represents 11 local councils, administered this scheme and a related program, the community rainforest reafforestation program. The government also took the opportunity to restructure the scheme to put it on a better footing by transferring the full responsibility to the board. This was to allow the board to further build on its strengths, such as effective infrastructure, the direct participation of local government and the considerable expertise of its workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aims of the restructure was to position the board to take full advantage of labour market programs. I would like to briefly mention some of the board's achievements in relation to employment. The board has employed 565 people in the last three years. In the next 12 months about 1.2 million trees will be planted across nearly 1,000 hectares and will involve six-month job training places for 400 unemployed people in North Queensland. Many of those employed on the two programs have gone on to have permanent employment. The board is planning further changes to its management and advisory structures, which will better integrate the administration of the two schemes without compromising in any way the conservation and commercial forestry objectives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the terrible unemployment figures in Tasmania compared to the national average. For unemployed youth, the national average is 30.3 per cent compared with 40.2 per cent in Tasmania. The overall average unemployment rate for Australia is 8.9 per cent, compared to 11.6 per cent in Tasmania. That is the unemployment rate and it is rising. Is the minister aware that, after a fall, the rate has been rising since August of last year? Is the minister also aware that, since the same period, official interest rates have gone up by 20 per cent impacting upon small businesses in Tasmania? I understand that there are complex causes of unemployment, but why inflict upon Tasmania interest rate rises which were meant to dampen the economy? How would the Tasmanian tourist industry be protected from your proposed bed tax?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1655" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already answered the question about bed tax. I am afraid I am not in a position to comment specifically on the Tasmanian employment figures because I do not have a brief about the regional variations, although I am perfectly prepared to accept Senator Harradine's statement that things there are worse than elsewhere. However, it does need to be appreciated how good the overall unemployment figures are. It needs to be remembered that, during the 1993 election campaign, the Prime Minister made a commitment to create 500,000 jobs over a period of three years. It will be remembered that `jobs, jobs, jobs' was the worthy issue on everyone's lips, including yours, Senator Harradine, and others in this place. We have not heard too much about that in recent times because those commitments have been overwhelmingly met. In just two years the government has exceeded that target, with February's employment growth taking total employment growth since the commitment was made to 560,000 people. That is a huge increase in employment and a huge reduction in unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the reduction has not flowed through to the percentage unemployment rate because of the very substantial increase in the participation rate. It is important that the participation rate is increasing, as Mr Crean said today, because that in itself operates as a moderating influence on wage pressures, which might otherwise take us into a renewed inflationary cycle. Of course, we are all anxious to avoid that, and all evidence suggests that it can be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to appreciate the significance of that participation rate from another perspective. If you compare the rate that we have at the moment, 63.75 per cent, with the rate that we had in February 1983, which was just 60.9 per cent, and if you translate the actual unemployment figures now into what they would be if we had a 1983 participation rate, we would be sitting on unemployment of just 4.2 per cent. It does need to be appreciated that this phenomenon of increase in the participation rate has had a terribly dramatic impact on the actual unemployment figures. So, with that participation rate of 10 years ago, we would be sitting on just 4.2 per cent unemployment at the moment. That is another way of making clear the magnitude of the government's achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's figure does not change our view about the pace of ongoing employment growth in 1994-95. We revised our forecast for employment growth a month ago from three per cent up to three and three quarters per cent. Nor does our view of where the economy is heading change as a result of these figures. When we released our revised economic forecasts, we announced that we would tighten fiscal policy in the budget. We hope that is the way that the emphasis can continue to be placed in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have mentioned the question of interest rates again. We have not ruled out the possibility of interest rate rises in the future. We will have to assess the stance of monetary policy on an ongoing basis. However, it certainly is our hope that, for the foreseeable future, no such further rise will be necessary. Certainly, that is the view so far as Tasmania is concerned, as with everywhere else in Australia. We are operating a single economy in that respect, even though the impact of unemployment can certainly vary region by region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a question you should be asking in the first stance of Mr Groom and his government rather than our government. We have done everything we conceivably can, through the macro-economic strategy, through industry policy and through the employment white paper proposals, so far as the long-term unemployed and the young unemployed are concerned, to get people to work.

So far as the bed tax is concerned, I have just made the point that there is no grounds for any assumption that any such tax would be imposed. It is a matter of looking very carefully at the employment implications of that&mdash;and certainly the regional employment implications are part of any such equation&mdash;before we even contemplate going down any such path. There is no basis for making any assumptions about anything. The fact that we will not rule it out is simply a standard position we are adopting in relation to any particular proposal that is put in the public domain by way of a revenue raising measure.

<PARA>The National Media Liaison Service has now been the subject of a lot of criticism, especially by us on this side of the chamber because of what we say is the political agenda of that organisation. We have been seeking and pursuing truth in relation to the National Media Liaison Service for some considerable period now. Be it through questions in this chamber, be it through questions at estimates, be it through supporting the Auditor-General in taking a look at the National Media Liaison Service, at every step of the way the government stops any degree of accountability by the National Media Liaison Service. It obfuscates and it does not want to answer the questions that are asked of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, today we bowled middle stump because the government was unable to deny what is so very plain in the document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Labor Party Communications Directory</EMPHASIS>. In the introduction to this paper Gary Gray, the national secretary of the Labor Party, tells us that the directory lists the names, phone numbers and addresses of the most influential people in the Australian Labor Party. We are also told that it is hoped the directory assists people in finding their way around the Labor Party. It is beholden on Senator McMullan, the Minister representing the Minister for Finance, to tell this house and the people of Australia how the National Media Liaison Service will assist the people of Australia in finding their way around the Labor Party. That is not the purpose of the National Media Liaison Service. The minister gave answers saying that, no, that definitely does not happen, yet we have it here&mdash;black on white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting exercises in my very short time here has been that, instead of having politicians leaking information to the media, we on this side of the house have had journalists leaking information to us. The reason that the journalists of this country are doing that is that they know first hand what the National Media Liaison Service gets up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I canvass another point in relation to the way this minister answers questions about the National Media Liaison Service. We went through an outrageous exercise at Senate estimates hearings of trying to find out the correct title of Mr Epstein. Mr Epstein and the minister time and again denied that Mr Epstein was the director of the National Media Liaison Service and said that that was wrong. That was in spite of the fact that we had a letter from his employing minister, Kim Beazley, saying Mr Epstein was the director of the National Media Liaison Service, despite the fact that the phone directory called him such and despite the fact the communications directory called him such, and I think there were half a dozen entries which also called Mr Epstein the director of the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with all those facts, the minister and Mr Epstein continue to deny that Mr Epstein was the director of the National Media Liaison Service. That was very early in February. Mr Epstein told the committee that he had done everything within his power by making telephone calls to correct this misinformation and that he had been doing so for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the February 1995 edition of the communications directory. We open it at page 127: `National Media Liaison Service, Director, Mr Epstein'&mdash;once again described as the director the National Media Liaison Service. But the most interesting aspect of all this is that when you look at questions on notice by Senator Richard Alston to Senator Graham Richardson you find that Senator Graham Richardson in 1991 stated that Mr Epstein was the director of the National Media Liaison Service. Senator Richardson admitted it. Why does this government try to now hide the fact that Mr Epstein is the director of the National Media Liaison service? A former minister admitted it. Every single document admits it. Kim Beazley admits it. Why deny it? It is because they have something to hide, and what they are trying to hide is the purely political nature of aNiMaLS, as is so directly highlighted in this ALP communications directory. </PARA>

<PARA>Today during question time I referred to an immigration matter of vital importance. It is a matter of pure natural justice for people in Australia. This matter has been highlighted widely in the media but we need to look carefully at the minister's letter to me dated 27 February 1995 where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs St Clair underwent health checks on 28 July 1993 and was medically cleared as a result of those checks. Her dependent children, who were at the time living in the United States, were required to provide additional information with regard to their medical examinations prior to a clearance being granted. This clearance was not obtained until 29 June 1994. However, prior to this advice being received, both Mr and Mrs St Clair were involved in a helicopter accident on the 21st of June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to describe the hospitalisation, et cetera. Those key dates are: 21 June 1994 and 29 June 1994. Obviously all the processes were in place. Mrs St Clair had been approved and so had her dependent children. Given that the government could then have procedurally processed this matter, there is no need now for this 12-month rule of a reassessment which, if implemented unfairly on Mrs St Clair, would involve the breaking up of an entire family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also appalled that the minister in his letter said that the further medical was to determine whether she was medically fit or whether her injuries were such that she would become a burden on the Australian taxpayer. What bunkum! Let us get down to the real issues. I have a letter from Mr St Clair's mother in Queensland, who wrote to me on 5 March. I quote part of that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sue is our daughter-in-law and Archie is our son. In due respects the amount of time, years, to receive your residency is deplorable. Sue should have obtained hers before the accident as she had been waiting patiently over the years for it. Why the present rush to have the second medical, as she was passed on the 28th of July 1993 and it is now the 5th of March 1995? After the accident she is now walking and in good health and mentally fit. Archie in the meantime needs her as she is his wife and she is also a trained nurse and can look after him. Their recovery rate so far is nothing short of a miracle considering the surgeon at the Royal Adelaide spinal unit told us that Sue may be able to walk but not so Arch. It is only the guts and determination that brought this miracle about and prayers from a lot of people, in particular the Sacred Heart nuns that taught Archie at school in Alice Springs.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this is an important case of sheer natural justice. Everything was in place, as were the times for approval. I am pleased that departmental officers in the media in the last week or so have acknowledged that there is a waiver principle available. But they supposedly need to ask for this second medical, which is only going to show, naturally, the extent of the damage to Mrs St Clair and the medical problem of her current condition. But she is up and about. She is assisting her husband. She is saving the Australian taxpayers money&mdash;not costing them. This couple are married. In the normal course of events this would have been by now a fully operational Australian family. I can only describe the answer of the minister today as absolutely disgusting and dismaying, given the social justice priorities the Labor Party espouses. </PARA>

<PARA>I was absolutely amazed at the two aspects of the reply of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Firstly, the minister claims that providing nuclear reactors to North Korea somehow guarantees our nuclear safety. Secondly, implied in the answer is that there is no alternative in terms of providing the energy to North Korea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first point, it is abundantly clear&mdash;we have many examples of this; in fact, North Korea itself provides the example&mdash;that the civil nuclear program does provide a route for the development of nuclear weapons. We have seen just in recent days the objections made by America to the provision to Iran of Russian technology to build nuclear reactors in Iran on the grounds that the civil program was a way in which Iran could get access to nuclear weapons. There is no certainty whatsoever that, having got that technology, having got those reactors, the North Koreans could not at some future time ignore any provisions in relation to how they dealt with that reactor&mdash;the unloading of the fuel, the reprocessing of the fuel and the preparation of material for nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of civil nuclear power stations is a route by which nations can get access to nuclear weapons and international agreements are not worth the paper they are written on when a nation decides that it is going to ignore those provisions and go its own way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a second point in relation to this. Sure, the North Koreans need energy. That was the reason, I suppose, they had these earlier graphite reactors. There are other, non-nuclear ways of providing that energy. I drew the minister's attention to solar hot water. The minister evidently is not aware of the fact that Australia has some excellent technology for commercial, high-temperature, solar hot water. While the minister talks about average hours of sunlight, I remind him that that figure on average hours of sunlight, which may be correct, disguises the fact that during the summertime the North Koreans have very long hours of sunlight and, in fact, could derive a great deal of energy from that source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that in this respect the Americans have been very clever in using this situation to advantage nuclear power development. We all know what a parlous state the nuclear industry in the US is in. I am not exactly sure how far the Americans are still involved&mdash;evidently the minister is not sure of this&mdash;with those South Korean operations. I suspect that they are still quite heavily involved. This is really a way of getting Australia to subsidise that development when alternatives could have been provided. It seems to me that Australia has not adequately researched these alternatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have already answered most of those questions. Senator Coulter must think the US negotiators are a bunch of geese in their approach to this whole issue. Their interest is exactly the same as the interest of us and everybody else in the region, which is to create an environment in which we can be as confident as we possibly can that there will not be any future nuclear weapon producing capacity in Korea and to find a mixture of incentives and safeguards to ensure that that will be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular civil power producing reactor that is there at the moment is a plutonium producing graphite moderated research reactor. It is only quite small in scale, but nonetheless the technology, as Senator Coulter acknowledges, is capable of producing plutonium. The whole point of the exercise was to shut that one down or any other similarly constructed reactor and to put in place lightwater reactors, which do not have anything like the same capacity to produce fissile material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, it is an inherent and integral part of the whole deal that the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its inspection and verification capacity, be an intimate part of the nuclear scene hereafter so far as North Korea is concerned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter is entitled to his scepticism; nothing I say will take that away from him. But it is the scepticism of those who abandon all hope of rationality or the utility of any kind of international discourse. We may as well pick up our bags and go home, because they can always invent a conspiracy, a tragic scenario or catastrophe that undermines the effect of those agreements. One has to work on different assumptions if any progress is to be made. If the United States and those of us in the international community who are supporting it had not gone down this path, nothing is more certain than the fact that North Korea would be sitting there manufacturing nuclear weapons right now.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">KEDO is the centrepiece of the US-DPRK Agreed Framework which was concluded in October 1994, in response to concern about North Korea's possible development of a nuclear weapons capability. The Agreed Framework embodies commitments by the DPRK to freeze permanently the operation of its existing plutonium-producing graphite moderated research reactor, seal its plutonium reprocessing facility, provide for the safe storage and eventual shipment out of the DPRK of spent fuel rods unloaded from its nuclear reactor and halt the construction of two new graphite reactors. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has verified that since the signing of the Agreed Framework, the DPRK is complying with these commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In return for these commitments, the DPRK will receive assistance from KEDO to construct two new lightwater type nuclear-powered reactors to meet its energy needs.

As past cases and reports by the Privileges Committee indicate, any suggestion that false or misleading evidence has been given to the Senate or one of its committees has always been taken very seriously and as a matter which should be investigated. The material placed before the President by the Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases provides sufficient basis for the President to conclude that the matter is capable of being held to meet criterion (a) and there is no other readily available remedy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is facing a looming economic crisis. Inflationary pressures are on the increase. Turmoil on international financial markets is putting the Australian dollar under considerable pressure. Yesterday, the international value of the Australian dollar reached its lowest level since early January 1994. In the last two months, the value of the Australian dollar has fallen by more than eight per cent; in the past week alone, it has fallen three per cent. The falls have been much greater when measured against certain key currencies&mdash;notably, the Japanese yen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The turmoil on the international currency markets will have a direct negative impact on economic growth in our major trading partners, particularly Japan and the United States. That will inevitably have a depressing impact on Australia's trade prospects and, therefore, worsen our already unsustainable crisis-ridden balance of payments deficit&mdash;the biggest deficit in the Western world, a deficit of true banana republic proportions. It is this deficit, having been a feature of Labor's disastrous economic performance year in and year out, that threatens our very sovereignty as a nation. It puts us into ever increasing debt to the rest of the world&mdash;a debt that is now eight times greater than it was when Labor came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our  arrogant  Prime  Minister  (Mr Keating)&mdash;who struts the world stage demeaning Australia's image by either petulantly carping on Australian domestic political issues or promoting his case for Australia to become a republic&mdash;talks about the need for Australia to become more independent. The President of Germany must have really wondered what he had struck when he met Mr Keating a couple of days ago and was subjected to Mr Keating's views on how a president should be chosen in any future Australian republic. I am sure he would have agreed with Alan Ramsey's description of Mr Keating in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this week as `a Prime Minister unhinged'. For heavens sake, what is the man about? The hypocrisy of going on about the need for Australia to be more independent, when his economic policies have done more to weaken our sovereign independence than any other person or event in our history, is quite breathtakingly sickening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates have risen savagely in Australia in recent months. Market rates since mid-1994 are now up by some 60 per cent. There is further market pressure on rates. The increase to date risks forcing economic growth to run into a brick wall. Already there are worrying signs of damage in important sections of the economy. The housing and construction industries are starting to look as though they are in for a decline. The job advertisement columns of the papers are showing that the job market is tightening considerably; in fact, the figures show that today there has been an increase in unemployed Australians to a figure of more than 800,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further rate increases will greatly accelerate the slowdown and put us back on the down slide as a result of this government's policies, this government whose economic performance throughout its 12 years in office has been characterised by boom-bust. We are now heading ominously towards another bust when we have had precious little gain over the past year or more&mdash;a brief five minutes of sunlight, as John Howard has so eloquently described it&mdash;after all of the years of pain resulting from Mr Keating's deliberate creation in 1990 of the worst recession in 60 years, the aftermath of which is still being felt in full brutal force, as I say, in particular by the more than 800,000 Australians who are still out of work as a result of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder members of the Labor Party in New South Wales breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Prime Minister boarded his personal Boeing to jet off to foreign lands a few days ago. They could not wait for him to go. They wish he would stay away until after the 25 March state election. He will not; he will be back by then. So they have done the next best thing and have said to him, `Paul, when you get back to Australia, please stay out of New South Wales until after 25 March.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But therein, of course, lies both a bitter and a sweet irony. Whilst Mr Carr and his Labor cronies in New South Wales do not want Mr Keating anywhere near the electorate until after the state election is out of the way because of the Keating government's dreadful policy failures in the areas of the economy, interest rates, the third Sydney runway, pay TV, the timber industry, jobs, and so on&mdash;the list is endless&mdash;at the same time they are relying on him to put off until after the election the announcement of further decisions this government in Canberra will take which will increase the hardship that the people of New South Wales will have to bear on top of the hardship already caused by federal government policies. I refer, in particular, to the further hike in interest rates that will inevitably occur because of the Keating government's incapacity, lack of will and lack of intelligence, quite frankly, to produce a budget that will enable further savage tax rises to be resisted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard stark evidence of that inability to understand the real situation in question time today, when Senator Gareth Evans said in response to a question that the Keating government has done virtually everything it can in macro-economic terms. What irresponsible nonsense that is. The government's books are in worse shape than they were five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Evans said today completely ignores the advice that the Reserve Bank Governor, Bernie Fraser, gave to members of the caucus earlier this week, when he said that if there was not a fiscally responsible budget, particularly in spending terms, and a restraint in spending, the bank would have no option but to opt for further significant interest rate rises. That is what is going to happen. There is no doubt at all about that. As a result of that, housing affordability in New South Wales as well as other areas of Australia is set to crash when these interest rates hit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite Senator Evans's weasel words in the Senate yesterday about not expecting interest rates to increase, he knows and the markets know that rates will rise. Access Economics yesterday predicted home loan mortgage rates will hit 13 per cent. Syntec says official interest rates are on their way to a further two per cent hike. Virtually all reputable economists agree with that, and yet the Keating government, which has already done so much to damage New South Wales finances, is about to go and do the same. Each one per cent increase in interest rates costs the New South Wales government $75 million in revenue lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a compounding of an existing problem. It is a problem that the government is desperately trying to sweep under the carpet until 25 March.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that a Victorian Liberal would put the proposition before us. It speaks volumes about the arid nature of the New South Wales Liberal Party that a Victorian has to be called upon to put forward a proposition which relates to the nature of federal politics and the state election. That is where I am going to confine my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tradition within the New South Wales Labor Party at the beginning of a state election campaign to say, as Neville Wran said in 1976, the welcome mat is not out for federal politicians. We have always tended to do that. We have always tended to focus upon the state issues and to campaign on our own merits and strengths and to highlight the weaknesses and flaws and absurdities of our opponents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming to the absurdities of our opponents, I will read a brief list of names for the interest of the Senate: Singleton, Greiner, Moore, Metherell, Smiles, Packard, Pickard, Pickering, Griffiths, Morris. What do all of those people have in common? All of them served during the term of the coalition government in New South Wales. All of them got into almighty trouble. Most of those cases involved resignations. Many of them involved scandals. Two in particular disgraced their office. I am talking about the people who refused to pay their taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if we want to talk about federal issues that have an impact upon New South Wales politics, we ought to start by looking at the Liberal MPs who refused to meet their obligations to the Commonwealth, to the tax office and to the rest of the taxpayers of Australia. They cheated on their taxes and set a very fine example to the rest of the community, to the rest of the political process and to all those honest Australians who do meet their obligations on a PAYE basis. These matters were accompanied by the usual round of ICAC hearings and the season tickets that some of Mr Fahey's ministers have to the ICAC. They were put to good use once again. They were down to the witness box at Redfern and so on and so forth. Frankly, the New South Wales government should have resigned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with taxes, let us focus just for a moment on the issue of state taxes. Let us look at the amount of state tax money that has been abused over recent months in a concerted state government advertising campaign extolling virtues that do not exist and covering up massive problems. Over the past 12 months, $36.7 million worth of state tax revenue was spent on state government advertising. That is a $14 million increase on the previous year. If I remember correctly, Michael Egan, the shadow minister for finance, calculated that sum would buy 28 school buses, provide an additional 230 police officers or 280 teachers for the state schools. Instead, all of that money was squandered by the state government feeling the pressure of an imminent general election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the federal issues which will have an impact on 25 March. I am referring to the creation of 560,000 new jobs by the Keating government. Many of them are in New South Wales and many of them are in the areas of economic expansion and the high technology sector. That is a record of which any government ought to be very proud; and we on this side of the chamber are proud. It reflects the highest rate of economic growth anywhere in the Western industrial world, anywhere in the OECD. These are facts, not suppositions and allegations as we hear opposite. We have a confident approach to matters of economic policy and an Asian-Pacific perspective. We are focused on the regions of New South Wales and beyond the rest of Australia. The federal government is involved in infrastructure projects and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look to the other side. What do we see? In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today we read about Senator Alston committing an incoming conservative government to privatising Telecom. If you want to fight at the next federal election, we will fight that issue very gladly, quite willingly. That will prove as devastating to you in many of the rural and provincial areas, as I suspect Senator Sandy Macdonald knows, as the GST and other foolish and absurd measures proved to be in 1993. It is not necessary to go into the pattern of deception that has emerged opposite in recent times: the push polling; the commitment to no cuts and then the commitment to some cuts; did Mr Howard's office know what the federal Liberal secretariat was doing; did Mr Howard's people go through the federal press gallery hawking documents and saying, `Please print them but do not attribute them to us'? There is no need to go into all those matters of deception. The public record will have an impact on 25 March. It will have an impact beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 we had the scenario whereby everyone wrote New South Wales Labor off&mdash;the pollsters did, the pundits did, all the commentators did. From memory, one <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> commentator characterised our campaign at that time as heading for a car crash. That was very clever, but it proved not to be the case. Exactly the same circumstances will be repeated on 25 March. The Labor Party will come home very strongly for the simple reason that we have focused on real issues of concern&mdash;health, law enforcement and education. Again the pundits will be proved wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales state opposition leader, Mr Carr, demonstrated in the last 24 hours what painstaking policy making in an area of public obligation can do. I am referring to the landmark agreement struck with the timber unions and certain conservation groups relating to the future of forests and national parks and the logging industry in our state. There is no question that a detailed, comprehensive approach bears fruit in terms of public policy and electoral estimation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the polls appear to neglect the fact that vast tracts of conservative votes are locked up in the upper North Shore of Sydney. This election is not going to be decided on the basis of a statewide vote; it is going to be decided on the basis of the votes in six or seven key marginal seats. In that sense, it is the most particular election in the state's history. It may be the most particular election in the country's history. There is no question that the political demography favours Labor in a number of those seats, be they on the mid-north coast, the outer western suburbs of Sydney, Maitland, or the Blue Mountains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the case that the Labor campaign, which carefully focuses on issues of real concern, tends to develop political momentum as the poll approaches. People are not fooled by extravagant promises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite surprised that this matter of public importance has been placed before us. From my experience, the party which is taking short-term political objectives as a priority over the long-term interests of the electors of New South Wales is clearly the present Liberal government. The Premier has been  pursuing a campaign of keeping as quiet and as low as possible and trying to push the blame onto a number of other parties, including the federal government and the Labor government prior to the present government's election. But the fact is that, after seven years of Liberal government, it cannot avoid accepting the responsibility for the failure of services&mdash;the failure in health, the failure in education, the failure in crime prevention&mdash;and that it is its responsibility and not the responsibility of some previous government or the Commonwealth government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to raise a matter that has caused me some distress over the last little while, and that is the issue of child care. In ignoring this particular issue and in performing in the way he has, the Premier, John Fahey, has particularly shown that he has no concern whatsoever for the long-term concerns of the families of New South Wales, in particular the women of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1990 the Commonwealth minister, Rosemary Crowley, approached the New South Wales government and offered to enter into a child-care strategy with the New South Wales government which would provide 3,500 long day-care places for families in New South Wales, plus it would offer many outside school hours places. What is the history of this matter? In April 1990 the offer was made. Eventually Robert Webster, who was the Minister for Community Services at the time, agreed to enter into discussion. In March 1992, two years later, John Hannaford informed the Commonwealth that negotiations would continue with a view to finalisation in April. In April 1992 they told the Commonwealth that they did not want to continue with responsibility for child care and they asked the Commonwealth to take over this responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of this, considering the problems in child care and having concern for families in New South Wales, Senator Crowley persisted in attempting to negotiate. Eventually, in August 1993, the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Howe, wrote to the Premier seeking some cooperation and expressing concern that there had been no finalisation some two years later and that the 3,500 places the Commonwealth was hoping to provide to the people of New South Wales had still not come about because of the state government's failure to cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in December 1994, lo and behold, Premier Fahey announced that he has entered into the agreement. This statement was a complete mystery to Senator Crowley, the Commonwealth minister, who was fully aware that the agreement had not been signed and that there was no agreement by New South Wales to enter into that agreement. Again, in spite of this, the minister continued to attempt to negotiate but the minister clearly states that there has been no signing of this agreement and the New South Wales government still refuses to agree to sign the national child-care strategy. As of yesterday there is still no finalisation of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What disturbs me about this whole incident is not just the fact that those child-care places have not been provided and that people in New South Wales are suffering, or Mr Fahey's attitude to this issue and his failure to take any action to ensure that the money to be provided for child-care places did come on line.

The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has heavied the Reserve Bank to defer the decision until 4 April, just after the state elections. By the way, every time there is an increase in interest rates, the burden it puts on industry, on business and on ordinary home borrowers in New South Wales is a disaster.

<PARA>I had the Parliamentary Library dig out for me the actual figures of private gross fixed capital expenditure; in other words, what is really happening in Australia, in what states the investment is going ahead. Interestingly enough, in New South Wales over the latest 12-month period to September last year, at constant prices, there was an increase of 22 per cent in private gross fixed capital expenditure. The only state which exceeded it, I must concede, is Queensland. New South Wales does not have the same resources for development as exist in Queensland, the metals and so on. Only Queensland has exceeded it. Victoria had 10 per cent, South Australia had 14.3 per cent, Western Australia had 18.2 with the Australian average at 18 per cent. New South Wales far exceeded the national growth in private sector investment. Yet Mr Keating has the integrity, has the level of confidence in his own interpretation of what he calls the truth, to say, `The answer is there is nothing to speak of in New South Wales.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating said that the truth is that nothing happens in New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the people of New South Wales have had the experience of a Liberal ministry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to specifically rebut the allegations of Senator Short. It is important to draw attention to the fact that the budget forecasts of 4.5 per cent growth were too modest. Growth is now more likely to be 5.5 per cent. There have been 13 consecutive quarters of growth, yet inflation has remained at or below 2.5 per cent for the last three years. The fact is that in February unemployment fell to 8.9 per cent. Labor has created 1.5 million jobs since it came into office. Employment is forecast to grow by 3.75 per cent in 1994-95. These are facts that specifically rebut the allegations that Senator Short has made on behalf of the opposition.

In New South Wales on this day he has pulled together the forestry industry, the trade unions of New South Wales and all of the threads of the timber industry. He has give the timber industry, which is a billion dollar industry in my state of New South Wales, a program that the environmentalists and the industry agree upon. That is a perfect example of the contrast: you have the muddling of the Fahey government, as it exists in New South Wales at the moment, and the promise of Bob Carr that at the end of this month he will pull people together in exactly the same way that this government has with respect to industry plans and bringing people together. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is substantially the same as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No 3) 1995 which was introduced into the Senate on 31 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which reported to the Senate on 1 March 1995. A majority of the Committee recommended that the bill be adopted but a number of the Opposition Senators who sat on the Committee dissented and called for a delay in the passage of the bill and for non-specified amendments to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This dissenting report of Senators Ellison, O'Chee and Abetz is based upon an inaccurate interpretation of the bill's provisions relating to the scope of the Refugee Convention ground of particular social group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition Senators remarked that the bill "seeks to disqualify those who have a well founded fear of persecution just because they are the unfortunate victims of China's fertility control policy". This has never been the intention nor the effect of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was made clear in the second reading speech and Explanatory Memorandum to the No 3 bill, the bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing social group, or on any of the other Convention grounds, who has a well founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the course of the Senate Committee's deliberations some submissions raised doubt about the operation of proposed sections 36(3) and 36(4). Amongst these submissions were those of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson. The acting Solicitor-General's advice was obtained by the Government. Following consideration of this advice and the totality of the evidence received by the Committee the Government has drafted amendments which incorporate the abovementioned statements from the second reading speech and the Explanatory Memorandum in the text of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will clarify the operation of the bill. Whilst many of the criticisms of the bill have been based on a misunderstanding of its purpose and effect, the Government acknowledges the depth of concern held by many people on the sensitive issue of fertility control policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the bill is not about the merits or otherwise of such policies. It is about the need to protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system whilst at all times vigilantly observing our obligations under the Refugees Convention to provide protection to genuine refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has two purposes, both of which relate to the need to protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's first purpose is to ensure that the fertility control policies of the government of a foreign country are disregarded in determining if a non-citizen is a member of a particular social group within the meaning of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol for the purposes of considering an application for a protection visa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was among the first to sign the Refugees Convention, and the Migration Act and our refugee determination system reflect the seriousness with which we take our obligations under the Convention. The Convention states that a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Useful though the ground of particular social group undoubtedly is, it is also the most difficult to define in practice. Assessment of whether a claimant is a member of a particular social group is usually left to those who administer and review our refugee determination system. However, the implication of the recent Federal Court judgement that a person may be recognised as a member of a particular social group simply because he or she is a person to whom the fertility control policies of a foreign government apply, or who objects to such policies, has such potentially serious consequences that the Government has decided to introduce the current bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the recent judgement dilutes the meaning of the Convention ground of particular social group. The judgement has considerably expanded those who need to be considered by the refugee determination system. Many of the people who would now have to be considered as a result of the judgement are not normally regarded as refugees by other countries. Consequently, the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system is being threatened which will in turn undermine public support for the discharge of Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To regard a large proportion of the population of China, or any country, as a social group and therefore as potential refugees simply on the basis of their government's fertility control policies is inconsistent with the intention of the Convention to provide protection to refugees with a well founded fear of persecution. One consequence of the inclusive nature of the Federal Court's decision is likely to be that those refugees who historically have been regarded as in genuine need of protection by Australia, and whose status should be determined quickly, will be disadvantaged as the system will have to deal with an increased number of applicants to whom the Convention was not intended to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing this legislation I emphasise that the Government is not questioning that the Convention ground of particular social group is a useful and necessary concept. Indeed the Government is seeking to bring the application of this concept into line with our international obligations following the recent Federal Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I stated earlier this bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a particular pre-existing social group, or on any of the other Convention grounds, who has a well founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person from a particular social group such as a village or workplace who is subjected to the rogue application of a fertility control policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under the legislation introduced today. Nor will a person who is a member of a particular religious, political or racial group subject to the persecutory application of fertility control policies be denied consideration of their claims under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned to address issues which might arise from gender based persecution and has been working actively in this area for some time. For instance our Humanitarian Program contains a specific women at risk component which targets resettlement assistance to refugee women in particularly vulnerable situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government is concerned to ensure that the Convention is interpreted correctly. This will ensure the retention of public commitment to our refugee determination system and the integrity and effectiveness of that system. Incorrectly diluting the meaning of particular social group under the Convention has the potential to undermine that public confidence and the ability of our determination system to do the job it was set up to do&mdash;to afford protection to genuine refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation introduced today will help provide a common sense approach to the definition of a particular social group under the Convention by precluding the possibility of very large numbers of people with nothing in common but that they may be affected in some way by the fertility control policies of their government being caught within the definition of a social group under the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second purpose of the bill introduced today is to prevent a non citizen from making further applications for a protection visa when they have already made an application, whether or not the prior application has been finally determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia operates one of the most thorough, efficient and equitable refugee determination systems in the world. A person's claim is assessed against the Convention definition of a refugee, and if it is not accepted at the primary stage, the person may appeal to the independent Refugee Review Tribunal which may reverse the primary decision. If a person's claim is still not accepted at the RRT stage, it is open to that person to seek review on administrative law grounds from the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current legislation, when a person has exhausted this process, it is not difficult for them to lodge another application for a protection visa and start the whole process again. The fact that repeat applications serve to delay the removal from Australia of the applicant has led to their increased use. The  processing of these repeat applications, which like the initial application are free of charge to the applicant, is both expensive and time consuming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a system is fair, open and contains the right to appeal the primary decision, claimants will generally have no need to repeat the whole process to get a fair hearing. That fair hearing is amply provided by the system as it exists already. The bill introduced today therefore will have the effect of barring repeat applications in the majority of cases. Its intention in doing so is to protect the integrity of, and support for Australia's refugee determination system and to ensure that available resources are expended on claims for protection which have not yet been exhaustively assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing this bar on repeat applications, the Government is aware that there will remain circumstances in which particular repeat applications may merit consideration. These cases are likely to include repeat applications which contain information which was not available to the claimant during the course of the first application, and which is of a nature that is likely to have a real bearing on the assessment of the need for protection. Events in the country of origin of the claimant that have occurred since the first claim may also mean that a second consideration is warranted. The Government has therefore decided that the Minister will retain a discretion to allow particular repeat applications to be assessed by the full refugee determination process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Minister's non-compellable discretion may only be exercised by the Minister personally, measures will be taken to ensure that all cases in which the Minister might wish to exercise his or her discretion are identified and brought to the Minister's attention. In such cases the Minister will present to Parliament the reasons for the exercise of his or her discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both aspects of the bill introduced today demonstrate the Government's resolve to maintain a refugee determination system that is targeted towards those with a claim to Australia's protection under our Refugee Convention obligations. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that there are some twenty million refugees in the world today. Australia has an obligation to help these people through the most effective means at our disposal. We meet this obligation through our overseas aid program, our assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives, our Humanitarian Program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life, and through our on-shore refugee determination system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the need arises to defend these efforts and to maintain their credibility, public support and effectiveness, as in the present case, the Government will do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS LAND CORPORATION (ATSIC AMENDMENT) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come shortly to the events that explain why the Senate is today considering this particular bill, and not the version of the land fund legislation which left this chamber for the other place last week. First, however, I want to remind the Senate briefly of what the bill is about. The central purpose of the bill, put simply, is to restore land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who have been dispossessed of their land at various times and in various ways over the 207 years of European settlement of this continent. To do so, the bill establishes a very substantial perpetual fund, and an indigenous land corporation to use and administer that fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of the Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) is to assist indigenous people to acquire and/or manage land "so as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders". To pursue those objectives, the ILC will have at its disposal  45 million dollars a year, indexed to preserve current values, as a draw down from the perpetual land fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporation, which will be under the majority control of indigenous representatives on its board, will develop regional and national strategies to carry out its tasks in a way which will maximise the benefits of the land fund to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation therefore establishes the means by which a substantial portion of the once-complete land base of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders can be restored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliament is now, finally, on the threshold of enacting this measure of pivotal importance to the indigenous people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond that, the measure will be a lasting part of the definition of this nation as a polity which is comfortable with its diverse racial and cultural heritage, and will deal justly with all its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have reached this point with the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill by a somewhat circuitous parliamentary route. The Senate is well aware of the detours upon which it sent the legislation, but for the record I should briefly go through what has happened in both houses of the parliament over the last month of this very long debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9 February this year, a select committee appointed by this chamber reported its findings on a large number of amendments proposed to a bill which had been extensively debated in both houses through the second half of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The select committee was unable to reach agreement. A majority, consisting of coalition and green senators, believed that the amendments proposed in this place last November should be pursued, despite acknowledging quite widespread opposition to some of those amendments among indigenous organisations and individuals who appeared before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minority, consisting of government and Australian Democrat senators, presented dissenting reports which essentially argued that the committee majority had failed to respond to the messages delivered by witnesses to the inquiry. It was clear to the minority senators on the committee that the best course was to proceed with the government's original legislation, as altered by a number of amendments we on this side had already accepted during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the fact that there was no prospect of the Senate agreeing to the bill before it, on 28 February, the Prime Minister introduced a new bill into the House of Representatives. The new bill incorporated 28 amendments to the original legislation&mdash;amendments to which the government was prepared to agree&mdash;but otherwise followed the form of the original bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our opponents on the issue in this chamber responded by using their numbers to bring on debate on the original bill. The result was that the original legislation, with some 70 amendments made here, was returned to the other place. Many of those amendments were totally unacceptable to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impasse was resolved two days later when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) informed the House of Representatives that the coalition parties would support the Prime Minister's new bill. The coalition's undertaking was given grudgingly, and for reasons totally unrelated to any genuine support for the principles or content of the bill: indeed, the Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that if the coalition parties ever get the chance, they will amend it to incorporate all those amendments which the government argues make the bill either unworkable in practice, indefensible in principle, or both.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless the undertaking was given. The bill we now have before us is the government's new bill, with one further amendment to which the House of Representatives agreed. That amendment to section 191d(4) will require the Indigenous Land Corporation to search the registers of the National Native Title Tribunal in relation to land being considered for acquisition. Since the Senate agreed last week to insert an identical amendment into the original bill, I assume it will be approved as part of the present bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original bill, with all the Senate's amendments, has been laid aside in the House of Representatives, and will expire when that house is prorogued for an election. So, the decks have finally been cleared for the parliament to approve this great measure of social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope the record will ultimately show that the bill was approved unanimously in this chamber as well as in the other place. It's regrettable that the record will not reflect a genuine agreement in principle between all parties, but the passage of the legislation is paramount for the government and for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government had intended that the land fund, and the Indigenous Land Corporation, would be operating on 1 January this year, a starting date which was put out of the question by the parliamentary tactics of coalition and green senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given passage of the bill, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs will now act as quickly as possible to make appointments to the board of the ILC, so that it can get on with the role assigned to it in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All honourable senators are by now very familiar with the scheme of the legislation, so I will not canvass the detail here. Suffice it to say that the government is very pleased that the ILC will now be able to pursue the bill's objectives largely unfettered by the prescriptive constraints and bureaucratic baggage that coalition and green amendments had threatened to impose on it. We can now look forward to a sustained effort to restore to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders something the Prime Minister has described as `that which is most precious to their sense of history and spirituality, that most essential component of their heritage&mdash;their land'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before concluding, I want to make some reference to the role of the large number of indigenous organisations who took part in the negotiations leading up to, and succeeding, the introduction of the original land fund legislation in June last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, I want to place on record the government's appreciation of the generally helpful and constructive manner in which those organisations contributed to the framing of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was obviously going to be a measure of great importance to all indigenous Australians, and the input of those organisations was both necessary and welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, I want to say specifically that our appreciation extends to indigenous organisations who disagreed&mdash;sometimes quite strongly&mdash;with aspects of the approach adopted by the government after those consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is neither a surprising nor a bad thing that there should be differences of opinion between organisations representing such a large range of indigenous people, in terms of their modern lifestyles and priorities as well as the inherent cultural diversity among Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the day, on this as on any other issue, it is the government that must decide, in the national interest, between competing priorities. This we did in the belief, which we still hold, that there is broad support among indigenous Australians for the approach adopted. A significant factor in this belief was the unanimous endorsement of the government's approach by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Given the propensity of some of those opposite to discount the views of ATSIC, I should state that the government makes no apology whatsoever for giving weight to those views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC is, after all, the most broadly representative and most nationally focused indigenous organisation. At the practical level, it has had some years of experience in the type of activity which the ILC will carry out as a result of this bill. Therefore the government did take notice of ATSIC's position on the land fund, as well as carefully considering&mdash;and adopting some of&mdash;the views put forward by many other organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of this process, now that the coalition has abandoned its long campaign to undermine it, is good legislation. It is legislation which carries forward the major commitment of this government which began with the Native Title Act of 1993. It reinforces the Native Title Act by creating the means to return land, and to continue returning land into the indefinite future, to indigenous people who have been dispossessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill therefore will partially restore the foundation of the traditions and identity of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. The government trusts that it will be a key to the revitalisation of the culture and heritage of indigenous communities throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week at this time I made a number of points about the egg industry. Many of these are also relevant to the pig industry, which this report deals with. One of those matters is the effect of GATT on the importation of products from countries which have health standards far below those of Australia. The Australian Democrats have had concerns expressed to us on this matter by representatives of the chicken meat industry and the egg industry. These concerns are just as valid for pig meat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, has given assurances that Australia's quarantine inspection procedures are among the best in the world, and I am sure he is doing all he can to ensure that this is the case. I certainly hope he is correct in his belief. I also hope the stringency of these procedures is not affected by any action through GATT to have them seen as a non-tariff barrier. It is certainly a concern to many people in food industries and it is for that reason that I put it on the record here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report contains some details of research being funded into a number of projects relating to animal behaviour and animal welfare. There are certainly a number of serious animal welfare problems that are present in piggeries. Unfortunately, attempts by the pig industry, the egg industry and many other animal based industries to address animal welfare concerns such as those which the Democrats and others often raise may also be thwarted by GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any improvements in conditions for animals in Australia can affect the ability of the industry to compete with products from other countries which have less regard for animal welfare. Attempts to regulate conditions to enhance animal welfare may be seen under GATT as a non-tariff barrier, which would threaten any potential gains in the conditions which animals face. I understand that GATT exemptions currently can apply if an animal is endangered as a species but do not extend to the welfare of animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report details some research into alternative housing systems for pigs. This is welcome. Intensive pig farming is a growth industry and in many ways can be considered similar to battery hens&mdash;animals are crowded into very small spaces, allowing little room for pigs to engage in natural behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of some importance to the pig industry is the growth in practices such as genetic engineering, which the Australian Democrats have repeatedly expressed concern about in the Senate. It recently came to light that some pork producers are using an injectible, genetically engineered synthetic pig growth hormone. Many people expressed concern that they might be eating pork containing these hormones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, pork from pigs with these unnatural hormones is not labelled in this way, so there is no way of telling. I know that many pork producers are equally unhappy that those who have not been using hormones on their pigs are not able to indicate this to those consumers who are concerned and suspicious about what might be in their pork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of those issues where there has been agreement between animal welfare and food producer organisations. The Queensland Pork Producers Organisation, Animal Liberation Queensland, and the Australian Association of Pig Veterinarians all expressed their opposition to the use of this hormone. It highlights the importance of ensuring that consumers have enough information to enable them to make informed choices and to choose products with confidence. Governments must not shirk their responsibilities in this area. The role of regulation should not be discarded due to economic rationalist ideology. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke last week on this document&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cultivating the human factor: Employment and skills in Australia's rural industries</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and noted that the emphasis in it is entirely on creating jobs in the traditional agri-pastoral industries and creating internationally competitive enterprises. Not unexpectedly, the consequence of this is a declining number of jobs, reduced job security for those who will be employed on a casual basis, lower wages and the further decline of family agri-pastoral businesses and rural towns that support and are supported by these businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the council had any real vision or feel for rural areas, it would know that, while the agri-pastoral enterprise will continue to be important, the towns that are doing well&mdash;the ones that are not becoming more beleaguered and dying&mdash;are either those which are regional centres, those which have a more diverse economy, often based on tourism and hospitality or are agricultural value added, or those that are attracting a new breed of rural dwellers: those people who specifically move to rural areas as an alternative to city living. These people could be providing services that would otherwise not be available in the rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural centres are those towns which have become or chosen to be administrative and service centres for the inhabitants of a large area. They are usually the locale for rural and administrative services. They are basically rural cities rather than rural towns, with a large portion of the population working in government, legal, financial and other services. They are the sites of rural radio and news services, medical services and higher education, with TAFEs and university extensions. They also provide cultural training&mdash;dancing, music, sports and so on&mdash;at a level above that of small towns. They are the centre of heavy construction in the region and usually include some light industry. They are the rural `big city', where one can buy from a greater diversity of goods than is available in small towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While they can be seen as providing many of the job opportunities available in urban areas and a diversity of employment, there are problems in these areas that are not the same as those in the massive conurbations that are state capitals. Niche marketing may not work in the country, since the niches are not big enough to survive. While many jobs and services may be available, training and experience are often only or primarily available in capital cities. The nature of the job may be subtly, or unsubtly, different from the equivalent job in the city. Jobs may require a far greater amount of out of office work, less specialisation, more general knowledge and better skills at relating to diverse and independent people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed in these areas is not only ensuring that there is training in all sectors of employment but training that is tailored for work in so-called urban jobs within a rural environment. Also special attention should be given to training and support in so-called non-rural industries that are suited to rural communities, such as electronics repair. Communications systems, including TV and radio antenna work in remote locations, and skills like fabrication of special design antennas for remote receivers and transceivers for both industrial and domestic use, are the sorts of industries ideally suited as light industry in rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that is overlooked is specifically science based services relating to land based industry. This includes environmental services, biological pest control services, entomology services, and so on. Farmers are not scientifically backward. Australian farmers, especially sheep farmers, are in the forefront in use of science-related breeding technologies. Many farmers understand the value of science. A greater availability of special science services could improve both productivity and sustainability of the land. These areas should also be target areas for regional centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While regional centres have a viability of their own, in spite of rural decline, they are too big and too much like cities to attract a great deal of tourism, unless there are major natural attractions close by. But many smaller towns attract tourists precisely because they are small and less like everything else in the ubiquitous, increasingly global `cityscape'. They have character, and this is attractive, as was noted even in the Kelty report. Towns that can capitalise on this are doing much better than those which cannot or do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism and hospitality industries are not competitors with traditional rural industry, although smaller, more diverse agrarian operations are more likely to be compatible than mechanised monoculture agribusiness. Local fruit and vegetable sales can supplement more traditional cash crops. Wine, yabbies and more exotic fruits and vegetables feed directly into the hospitality trade, helping to establish a unique cuisine based on local products and seasonal dishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, while much maligned, art and artisan based activities result in a range of products that enhance the interests of tourists and travellers, working synergistically with tourism. While the image of country craft shops may be called up, there is significant scope for people wishing to make use of availability of material and lower rental overheads and land and house prices to engage in self-employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak today on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand report&mdash;Third Meeting&mdash;Records and Resolutions</EMPHASIS>. The third meeting of the Agriculture and Resource Management Council mainly addressed the drought problem. The report highlights the devastating impact of drought on Australia, on farmers and our economy. There is one mention on page 5, paragraph 6, that some drought relates to the El Nino southern oscillation, or ENSO, which in turn relates to warming. What is not mentioned anywhere is that, therefore, drought may become more common as the planet warms. Even where drought is not more common, CSIRO estimates other problems as the climate becomes less stable and regional climate changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although not mentioned in this report, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made statements accepting this relationship, and the government in this place has also supported motions and made statements accepting this. It is in this light that we should look at the report and the national drought policy, or NDP. Under resolution No. 1, paragraph 4, we see it noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NDP encourages primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches in managing risk.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, basically farmers can expect to be left on their own in the case of drought. In practice, we have seen drought relief, but it was not something that came easily. Quite a lot of very strong calling on government had to occur, both in this place and by the public. Even then the government delayed until the extent of the drought and its likely major impact on the economy became apparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is consistent with the Prime Minister's public statement on climate change and drought, which put the view that drought and hardship would result from climate change and so were not exceptional. The view was further put that farmers would have to adjust with minimal assistance, because farms that were viable when drought was occasional would no longer be viable and, therefore, should not get emergency support since it was not an emergency but a new reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when government talks about farmers adopting a self-reliant approach, what it means is something equivalent to the economic adjustment we hear of in relation to the citrus and other industries. In other words, it is just a euphemism for allowing those whose farms become marginal to go broke and for their farms to be abandoned. Those who are in a good location in relation to a changed climate will do well, and if land currently unused becomes usable new farms will start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on, I would like to make the point strongly that in relation to climate change it is not going to be a change from this to that. It will be continuing change as the planet warms, icecaps melt, vegetative cover alters, and so on. It will involve not only rainfall but also average temperature, growing seasons, distribution of insects, fungi and other fauna, with changes in both pest and disease populations and populations of biological control agents. We have no idea what will be viable where or for how long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, self-reliance is a problematic idea. Farmers do not have easy access to capital at reasonable rates of interest to pay for change. Banks do not look at risk management as a good thing. They do not require landcare practices. They tend to see a loan for equipment for a big monoculture farm as a better risk than a loan for a farm to diversify into a wide range of products, including agroforestry. They will see possible climate change as making a loan less certain and therefore less attractive. Farmers suffering the first impacts of climate change are those most likely to want to change crops and farming practices, but these are the people in the worst position to do so precisely because they have suffered impacts of climate change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate in its resolution on drought of 21 September last year noted the need for not only drought relief but also a policy and comprehensive package to assist farmers to adapt to a change in climate. I see no evidence of that here. It was apparently not discussed. Certainly the Agricultural and Resource Management Council can see the need for this. If not, we should definitely inform the council of it and the motion of the Senate on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have more to say on this report. Particularly, I am concerned about the failure to give drought relief to some farmers because they slip through the net. This net has very large holes. I mentioned earlier that paragraph 4 says farmers should be self-reliant and welfare issues should be addressed through social security. If this is the policy of government, there are real problems with the application of social security regulations, especially the assets test and unemployment regulations to farmers. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand report&mdash;Fourth Meeting&mdash;Records and Resolutions</EMPHASIS> is a report of a meeting following the one I have just spoken on. At this meeting they dealt with many more issues than drought, but I would like to revisit drought briefly. Resolution 1A, paragraph 6, emphasises the principle that drought assistance packages must be targeted only to people in exceptional circumstances. This clearly excludes people where climate is changed and ignores the need for adjustment to long-term climate change. I understand that drought assistance is not supposed to cover these areas, but this would be easier to accept if there were some other package of assistance that addressed these other issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council seems to have looked at some of these issues, and conclusions are presented in relation to resolution 1B on pages 9 through 12 which deal with sustainable resource management. The Greens strongly support many of the resolutions, especially paragraph 19f, which calls for an integration of various policies into a dominant approach over a wide range of areas and issues. We do note, however, that there does not seem to be any integration of climate change issues and how they will affect the diverse range of areas; that is, landcare, algal blooms, water quality, rangeland management, desertification, and so on. Surely this integration is needed if things like on-farm risk management, drought preparedness, and so on, are to be other than short-term, ad hoc measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have some strong reservations about the idea seemingly embraced by the council, seen in resolution 1B paragraphs 2f, 3a, 6a, 6b, 6e and 19e. The idea is that sustainability measures, especially in relation to landcare, should have `performance indicators' relating to an outcome focus. I would have very little problem with this as long as I knew that a farm or station would have the ability to continue without degrading the resource base and to positively rehabilitate damaged areas and improve sustainability. I know that is the sort of outcome farmers talk about when they talk about knowing that their life comes from the land. They have to care for the land. My worry is that outcomes will be couched in pure economic terms at least demanding that the solutions belong to that pervasive set of measures called win-win solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have nothing against win-win solutions; we often advocate them. We do have problems where the demand for an economic win to be included in every measure means that measures get short shrift when it is thought that they only make a farm more sustainable or they only improve a degraded area without generating a direct and immediate economic return. We strongly support paragraph 9, which says that it is time to shift landcare efforts from awareness raising to implementation and time to examine tax changes in support of this. I have already spoken in here at various times in support of tax changes to eliminate incentives to land clearing, and to not only recognise landcare measures as valid expenses, and therefore tax deductible, but also to provide positive tax incentives to landcare and rehabilitation. This is not only for farmers. Contributions should be made by others as legitimate donations to land and water care, and for uncleared land for preservation as natural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens favour regional approaches but have some difficulty with many of the programs running under that flag. `Regional approach' for us means getting the community together to look at the potential, and the problems, the area has. It is working out an integrated approach for people to create the sort of life the people want. It does not mean bureaucratic, top-down regional development in the interests of international or other large export-oriented business interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are glad that increasingly, as seen in resolutions 1D and 1E, environmental cleanness is seen as an important economic advantage. I hope this will flow through to tighter regulation of chemical pollutants, especially ogano-halides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was distressed that delivery of quarantine and export inspection services was raised as an issue. This often means that somebody is thinking of privatising them. That would be a huge mistake for quarantine services. It appears that the council has rejected any move to take these services out of Commonwealth hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a final comment on this report, I ask senators to notice resolution 2J on page 45. This concerns the ability of Australia, or its constituent states, under GATT or the World Trade Organisation rules to pass sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, that is, measures to ensure that meat and plants are clean and disease and pest free. Phyto-sanitary refers to plants and sanitary to meat and animal products. It is something that was alluded to by the Democrats today. It is important that, in trying to abide by an international regime, we make sure that we do not actually destroy our own industry. </PARA>

<PARA>Highway 1, the national highway that stretches from Norseman to the South Australian border, is a national disgrace. When Cyclone Bobby crossed that region some fortnight ago, the resultant flood cut off the road from Western Australia to South Australia&mdash;indeed, all of the eastern states. Furthermore, it cut the railway line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took at least eight or nine days for the traffic flow to be restored and that was only for cars. After a few more days it had dried off enough and some trucks were able to get through. Upwards of 300 to 400 trucks, let alone cars, were held up at that point, which is only 20 kilometres east of Norseman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Eyre Highway is not a back road of Western Australia, or anywhere for that matter; it is highway one. It is supposedly the only all weather connection between east and west, unless you think an alterative route is through the top end through Kununurra, Katherine and Alice Springs. Anyone who has studied geography at all would know that at this time of the year that road can be flooded. The same cyclone that cut the roads in Western Australia cut the Great Northern Highway. Hopefully, that highway was better prepared for the floods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this road was cut off did not raise a whimper in this place whatsoever and it did not raise a whimper in the other place either. That is because it is in Western Australia and away from the eye and anything that this government thinks is important. The government has done nothing about it. The fact that the railway line was cut for two weeks did not rate a mention with members of the government in this place or the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will get your chance. The railway line has been cut off for nearly a fortnight. The engineers have told us that it will be off for another 10 days. That was of no concern to the government either. If it has been mentioned in this or the other place no concerns have been raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has Mr Brereton had to say in relation to this fiasco? He has said absolutely nothing. He did not have the decency to ring the Minister for Transport in Western Australia to find out what was going on, let alone offer any help. We are talking about a national highway. He did not ring the minister in Western Australia and he did not ring his department. If he does not want to talk to the National Party minister in Western Australia, he could have rung his department to get it to offer some help. Nothing like that has been done. That is the situation in Western Australia. That is the importance Mr Brereton places on that national highway. That is the importance he places on trade between east and west. Western Australia produces 25 per cent of Australia's export income. We know where Mr Brereton's feelings lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last two weeks Senator Schacht has been having a run on small business. With all the talk this week about small business he has failed to tell us what experience he has had in small business. He has not told us anything whatsoever. With his workings in the Labor Party of South Australia over the years he has helped large businesses become small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has not attached any importance to the cutting of the link to Western Australia. The trucks were held up and they had supplies that were needed in the west. Commerce flows both ways on that link. Livestock was amongst those supplies that were held up. There were a few medical problems. One pregnant woman had to be airlifted out. This government sat on its hands and did nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty per cent of freight east-west goes by road and a certain amount goes by sea. The rest goes by rail, which, of course, is already out. I suppose you could ask me why I blame this government for an act of God, or an act of nature or whatever when Cyclone Bobby cut that road off. But, in relation to this national highway, the blame lies squarely on this government, which has not provided the suitable funds for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were supposed to have had a top highway that was town free and dust free by 1992, if I remember rightly. I suppose you can forget its being town free because the bypasses do not seem to be quite as popular anymore. In other words, the dust-free road was wide enough so that trucks and cars could pass without ever having to go off the gravel and therefore creating dust which could lead to accidents. That was how the situation was supposed to be by 1992 when I was in local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still 400 kilometres to be done to the Eyre Highway, needing another $100 million to bring it up to an all-weather road. At present, where the trouble occurred, the Main Roads Department is working on constructing 16 kilometres of road. Sixteen kilometres goes into 400 kilometres a lot of times. That 16 kilometres is costing $4.6 million. So that is the basis on which that $100 million is required to get that all-important road up to scratch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day in taking note of an answer&mdash;and now I remember when it was that Senator Schacht mentioned this&mdash;I said that blame has been on the WA Main Roads Department for ripping up the road and so much of a section altogether. The blame is on it, but the point is that it has been so short of funds. It is not able to use the good engineering factor, especially with those roads where there is plenty of land for constructing a new highway approximate to the other one and, when it is finished, just cutting the two ends over, as they used to do on the highway when I used to travel on it. Senator Foreman no doubt has travelled a lot on that highway on the South Australian side, and he would know. It costs 30 per cent more to construct the road along the side and then to cut it in. But the old one is not wasted altogether because parts of it become tourist bays and truck bays for drivers of trucks and cars to pull off and have a rest. So that is why the WA Main Roads Department had to rip up the whole section and try to work on the whole section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You might blame the department for doing 16 kilometres at the time, but 20 metres is enough when you cut a highway and have no alternate road. If the Hume Highway had received the same treatment from a cyclone, I bet there would not have been such a lack of action by Minister Brereton in providing some relief, especially in trying to trump the New South Wales state government or something like that. But the Hume Highway has an alternate highway, whereas the Eyre Highway does not. So that is the reason those 16 kilometres were being done. An extra $1.5 million on that project alone could have had the bypass road in. As I pointed out the other day, that is the standard practice of doing pipelines&mdash;constructing a new one alongside and then cutting them in at each end. You may blame the cyclone, but the lack of funding over the years to Western Australia and the government neglecting its own national highway have led to the whole state of the road being down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You must also remember, Mr Deputy President, that the Western Australian side of the Eyre Highway, as a whole, was constructed by the state government of Western Australia through its Main Roads Department before the national highway system came into being. The South Australian side was constructed later. I think we had a Premier named Playford at that time. We, from Western Australia, were telling him to get on with his side of the highway so that we would have an all-bitumen road through, but he took it upon himself to wait until the federal government paid for it. That is why it is far better, as those who have travelled along it would know. In that way alone, the federal government owes plenty. For that reason, Western Australia did not get it. We need the funds to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now look at rail. Rail has been cut for a fortnight already. Today's newspapers tell us that it will be at least another 10 days before rail will be moving again. But what has not been taken account of is the fact that studies have shown that the main floods further up due to Cyclone Bobby have not reached where the railway line is cut. When they hit in 10 days time, even if the line is fixed it will go out of action again. So the state government has to make up its mind whether it will wait till the floods go down to fix it up or try to hop in quickly and lift it above the flood level. My good friend the Western Australian Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, told me this morning that the government is sending a lot of equipment to that area hopefully to do something before it is flooded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also national railway line across there. Where is the National Rail Corporation? It was supposed to upgrade this line under the One Nation statement of quite a few years ago. What has the government been doing in relation to that? It should have at least been keeping the line up and running. If both of the lines cannot be kept open, we should ensure that at least one avenue to Western Australia remains open all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no alternative route, as I said. That is the only way from east to west. You have the road and rail fairly close together. This government must stand condemned for not doing something far before now. It may say these types of floods occur every 50 to 100 years, but Australia must consider its defence. If something untoward were happening in Western Australia, land transport of forces would be completely locked out as an option. As I said, if a cyclone cuts the Eyre Highway, the other one further up is likely to be cut also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cut in funding to Western Australia has been immense. Western Australia has 25 per cent of national roads. I am talking about national highways&mdash;nothing else. We have 25 per cent, yet we get only seven per cent of this government's funding. That is all we get. Senator McKiernan can grin as much as he likes but can he explain why the federal government and Mr Brereton have neglected Western Australia for so many years? All this government is interested in is allocating funds for national highways on the basis of vehicle movement. It does not allow for the heavy volume of traffic as far as the big rigs are concerned. The government does not look at that. It simply looks at traffic movement. Although that highway has plenty of trucks running backwards and forwards, it is down on car volume compared with Sydney and Melbourne and that is why Western Australia's funds are down. That is all the government is interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to some other material I have with me. To the shame of the federal government, at the latest count it collects $10 billion annually in fuel excise and, of this, only $780 million goes to Western Australia. With the six per cent increase in the fuel levy in the last 12 months, Western Australia's contribution will now be $1 billion. What goes back west? A miserable $150 million. That is all Western Australia will get. That figure was stretched to $160 million a couple of years ago, but it has certainly been brought back. We have 4,650 kilometres of national highway in Western Australia, or 25 per cent of that network, yet we get back only seven per cent of the funds collected from fuel excise. When we compare that seven per cent we currently get with the 11.7 per cent we got in 1985-86, we see that this Labor government has been cutting back immensely on Western Australia's funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to compare the funding the federal government gives to Western Australia with what it gives to the rest of Australia. In total, $150-odd million goes to the west. Looking at the national highway allocation&mdash;it does not go on anything else&mdash;and at the federal dollars per kilometre figure, in all of Australia $44,400 per kilometre goes on roads. Western Australia allocates $12,500 per kilometre&mdash;one quarter of the sum allocated to Australia. You might say that the Western Australian government is not doing the right thing. It is. All over Australia the states spend an average of $2,300 per kilometre and Western Australia&mdash;vast state as it is&mdash;spends $2,210. Overall, Western Australia is up with everything the state governments do but in federal government funding we are miles behind anyone else. I could read out figures for all the other states that are far greater than Western Australia's but I would only be wasting the Senate's time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to federal highways, in Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA>we are getting a quarter of the money per kilometre that we should have. The Eyre Highway is the only connection between east and west. This government should stand condemned for holding up the 1,500 people who were stranded, the thousands of tonnes of rotting produce that was travelling either way, the livestock and all the people who were inconvenienced. I look forward to a big increase in road funding for Western Australia in the coming budget. Western Australian senators will stand condemned if they do not back me up. </PARA>

I have seen some figures that were issued in Western Australia pretty recently which took into account some special funding programs and which were mentioned in Senator Panizza's motion to take note last Monday when this issue was raised in the Senate. I am glad that Senator Panizza acknowledges that I was again correct in my interjections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the black spots special funding. Special funding on top of the normal funding does not mean that, when that special funding is not continued later on, it is a cut. We are fudging things if we are using figures like that. I am not saying Senator Panizza was fudging things, because he did not use the figures. Other figures that I have seen back in my own state of Western Australia relate to different years and different road funding programs. One that comes to mind particularly is the Bicentennial projects funding that led up to 1988, Australia's Bicentenary. Additional special funding was given in the years leading up to 1988 but they are taken into account in some sectors of the community in order to compare funding between a given year&mdash;fudging the figures. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do you want to fudge the figures? I would join with Senator Panizza and any other Western Australian senator from anywhere in the chamber in calling for additional funding for roads. There is a need for it in certain sections. But at the same time I would want additional funding for public transport, to take the pressures off the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to my own state of Western Australia. One of the things the state Labor administration did when it came to office in 1983 was open up, again, the Fremantle to Perth railway to take pressure off the roads. Not only did it open up the railway, it also extended the railway into the northern suburbs. I do not know whether Senator Panizza has ever been into the northern suburbs of Perth, perhaps the most beautiful part of Perth, but if he has he would have seen for himself how efficient that system is. It is actually, to the best of my knowledge, making money for the current government. Not only did the state administration do that, but it also electrified the railway system within central Perth.</PARA>

Senator Panizza is clearly wrong when he asserts that the Eyre Highway was closed last week because of a lack of federal road funding. The reason the Eyre Highway was closed last week was that we had a cyclone cross the coast of Western Australia and cross it at a point much lower down than it normally does. Subsequently, as it was dying out the cyclone went further inland and dropped more water on the inland, which in turn then ran out.

That water sought to get away somewhere and it went across the Eyre Highway and stopped use of the road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another unfortunate event occurred last week. The Main Roads Department of Western Australia was actually spending some Commonwealth funds on the upgrading of the Eyre Highway. I am not going to criticise the Main Roads Department of Western Australia for doing that because the funds were allocated for that job. Others have criticised it in the media, but I am not going to because the department was doing the right thing. It was unfortunate for the department that its upgrading of the Eyre Highway occurred at a point in time when this water from Cyclone Bobby was heading down the coast&mdash;down to your part of the world, Senator Crane&mdash;to exit into the sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What amounts of Commonwealth funds are spent on the Eyre Highway? Since 1989, just six years ago, $60 million of Commonwealth funds have gone towards the reconstruction work being undertaken to improve the geometry, the width and the pavement condition of the road, much of which is up to 30 years old, as Senator Panizza quite graphically explained in his contribution, which preceded mine. The unseasonable and unpredictable weather conditions that resulted in the closure of road and rail links are very unfortunate. They were, as Senator Panizza has described, a natural phenomenon or&mdash;he might want to believe it more than me&mdash;an act of God. Whatever it was, it was unfortunate and some trucks carrying foodstuffs were delayed on that road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the first time this has happened in Australia on the Eyre Highway. I suggest that it will not be the last time.

Peter Morris opening a bridge in the Kimberley region of Western Australia when he was the Minister for Transport in the Hawke government. In opening the bridge, he commented that the bridge was built to take the 100-year flood. One week after the minister opened the bridge to take the 100-year flood, the 100-year flood came. It was bigger than was predicted. The bridge that was built to withstand the 100-year flood was not there when the flood disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does one plan for these things? That planning was with the Main Roads Department of Western Australia, which has a reputation surpassed by none of the other road authorities throughout Australia. It has a very good reputation for building and maintaining the road system in Western Australia. It participated in that planning for the 100-year flood in the Kimberley region. The flood turned out to be perhaps a 200-year flood. We did not have a bridge that was built to withstand a 200-year flood. Perhaps we could spend the allocation of funds that are now going to the Eyre Highway on building bridges all the way across it. We will then make sure that when the flood comes, which will inevitably come at some time in the future, water will go under the road rather than do what it did last week and the week before, which was cut road links. </PARA>

It is worth making the point that, after that tragic accident and after the promise of funding from the Commonwealth to assist in making that road safer not only for the road travellers but also for those people in the shopping centres at the bottom of the hill, the state government in its wisdom went to Britain seeking expert advice on what we in Australia should do with our roads. That advice was available in Australia. There was no need for the state government to go overseas and spend big amounts of money. I do not think the exact cost of the consultant who advised the state government on those arrester beds has been revealed. In my opinion, that was a waste of money. I am certain that that expertise could have been found amongst those very professional people who are employed in the Main Roads Department of Western Australia.

The state government wants to sink the road and leave a huge gap on top. It does not want to put a tunnel in; it does not want to put an overpass in. It wants to cut the city in half&mdash;even more than it is at the moment&mdash;much to the opposition of the local residents and the local business people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system of funding to states maintains and enhances the national highway system. It is not in any way related to the road length or the level of contribution to fuel excise. Suitability of the road for given traffic levels is more fundamentally determinant of road investment needs. This will change substantially over time as major enhancements are completed. For example, in the late 1980s, the expensive sealing of the national highway in WA and other states was undertaken, making the national highway funds for WA higher in those years. It was higher at that time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza presents us today with an interesting motion, but, before I start on the substantive arguments in it, I would like to say that the Greens (WA) believe that we need to plan for the time when there is less petroleum. I have said this on a number of occasions, but the reality is that we are reaching the peak of world petroleum supplies&mdash;we are reaching the halfway point. That does not mean that we have not got petroleum left in the world; it means that the petroleum from now on becomes more and more marginal and more and more expensive. We are going to reach a crunch. The longer Australia waits to change and to become less car dependent, the harder the crunch is going to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza suggests that highway funding should have a more direct relation to the amounts of roads a state has. The more roads, the more funding regardless of use. He then suggests that all funds from fuel should come back as dedicated road funding and/or state export income. One of the first issues here is to notice that since 1990 there has been an agreement to untie funding so that road funding no longer comes through as dedicated road funding. The same amount of money is to be paid to the states, but it is left increasingly to the discretion of the states whether to spend that money or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of tied grants going to Western Australia is 7.1 per cent, about $58.1 million. The amount of untied identified arterial road grants for Western Australia is $43.3 million, which actually brings us to 12.5 per cent&mdash;slightly less than we would get if money was divided equally between states, and substantially more than we would get if we got a share based on proportion of population. The amount of untied identified local road grants Western Australia receives is $51.5 million, or 15.8 per cent. The total road funding is therefore $153 million, or 10.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Western Australia is larger than other states. It also has one of the most concentrated populations of any state. Most people live in the Perth metropolitan area and, of those who do not, most live in the south-west corner of the state. There are vast tracts with basically little industry and very few people. There may be roads of great length, but what is the basis for this claim for road funding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Senator Panizza mentions the importance of exports. Okay, let us look at exports. As Senator Panizza admitted in another debate, about 90 per cent of Western Australia's wheat travels by rail. Virtually all of its iron ore travels by rail. Woodchips travel by rail. Bauxite and alumina travel by rail. That is the bulk of our primary exports travelling by rail. The land transport development fund put only 4.6 per cent of its funding into rail, yet I do not hear Senator Panizza calling for a greater percentage of rail funding, in spite of the fact that rail funding is more important to our exports than road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at roads for a moment. We have got trucks still taking bricks from Perth to Darwin. We have got town after town&mdash;Bridgetown, Busselton and Northam&mdash;trying to get funding for bypasses, even though bypasses are somewhat of a technofix because they are associated with some of their own problems, especially for smaller towns reliant on people stopping off, and bypasses may siphon off some of that business from them. Bridgetown, Busselton and Northam are trying to get funding for bypasses. Why? Because they are sick to death of all the trucks hooning through their towns. Most of these trucks do not stop, do not give them business and are making their towns dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When other Greens or I have gone to bypass meetings, everyone expresses distress at the impact truck traffic is having on their town. The two big parties argue about whose fault it is that funding is not available. Northam has been trying to get a bypass for almost 30 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What traffic is rural WA mainly getting? We have a steady stream of road trains pouring through towns like Northam, Merredin and Southern Cross&mdash;and the Court government is talking about bringing them all the way into Midland.

It would be far safer, use a lot less energy, use a lot less space and cost less to maintain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look a bit further at roads. Most people in WA live in Perth. Perth is one of the most car intensive cities on earth. It is worse than Los Angeles in that respect. It has been built as a sprawl&mdash;a huge strip of suburb extending along the coast virtually from Two Rocks to Safety Bay. Its public transport is entirely inadequate and the infrastructure costs, including road costs, are huge. So why is there no urban planning to look at this? Why are there no measures to ensure that people are not stuck in situations where they have to drive half an hour to get to work, which becomes an hour or more during rush time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing particularly equitable about car use, not in cities, not in the country. In cities, it just locks people into situations where the poorest are pushed to urban fringes, with longer transport lines and poorer services; where they have to depend on older inefficient cars. This is bad ecology, bad economy and bad social justice. If there were a rational transport strategy based on minimising road use, we would all be better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a few other issues to raise in relation to this motion. Senator Panizza specifically refers to the Eyre Highway and its problems. He makes use of the `fix Australia, fix the roads' propaganda, yet he does not mention the disputes over the way the state government has handled roads, road maintenance and road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must mention also the funding that the state government is calling for&mdash;which I will further mention later&mdash;with its 4c per litre levy on fuel. In the particular plan for the use of that, it will not go to regional roads which have been run down; it is planned to go to increasing traffic on urban roads, road widening and more freeways. That is the large part of where this plan for the four per cent levy is going. So the reality is: you pull the heartstrings of the regional centres to get support for this particular levy, but in reality the money is largely going to increase the traffic problem in the urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth says that, in the 1993-94 financial year, it gave an extra $69.2 million in untied grants for road maintenance and will put in an extra $72.2 million this year. Yet it appears that the state government has not used this money for roads. The state government has also levied, as I have mentioned, its own tax of 4c per litre on fuel. Both the opposition and environment groups note that the fix the roads campaign is funded basically as a political tool to attack federal government and by the road lobby to pursue their vested interests. Environmentalists are less concerned about this than the push to further road funding feeding greater and greater car and long-haul truck use, both of which are major greenhouse culprits, at a time when other options should be and must be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza calls for more of the consumption tax on fuel to be paid into road funding. Would he like that to be dedicated road funding? Would he be happy to see untied funding tied back to roads? I also wonder whether Senator Panizza would like to see cuts in the federal budget to pay for roads, or whether he would care to propose alternative taxation to replace the petrol taxes in general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens would like to see more of the petrol tax tied to outlay programs. We have said so and tried to do so in the 1993 budget when the tax fuel hikes were put onto the Senate. We differ from Senator Panizza in that we wanted to see them tied to funding a more rational transport and urban design program to reduce fuel use. This would have supported rail, which is the real form of transport used by WA exporters. It would have supported urban design. It would have reduced state expenses and freed up some of the money spent maintaining urban roads and road infrastructure. Yet we received no support from the coalition on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No, the Greens will not support this motion. It is purely regressive. It is a political ploy and it does not recognise the state's role in transport under untied funding arrangements. It ignores the social and environmental costs of our current mode of transport, and is part of the problem&mdash;an approach that should have died years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, more money needs to be spent on the transport area, and it would make sense to assure funding through an arrangement like that of the Land Transport Development Trust. But the money should not go into expanding the sorts of things we are doing now. There are urgent needs in relation to transport to change the structure of transport radically and allow us to move people and things with considerably less energy, less pollution and less cost. We can do that while improving the lives of many people, and we should do so, are obliged to do so, under our greenhouse commitment because transport generates a huge portion of the anthropogenic greenhouse emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will cost money, but will ultimately save money, reduce our dependence on imports and make us far less vulnerable to increases in oil prices that are inevitable, as I said earlier. A crucial and relatively easy project would be to try to eliminate long-haul road transport across the Nullarbor, where it is not necessary, and replace it with rail. Yes, something must be done urgently about transport, but that is something that has little to do with Senator Panizza's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of my colleague Senator Panizza and to congratulate him for bringing it into this place for debate. I am absolutely amazed that any Western Australian, whether it be Senator McKiernan or Senator Margetts, could come in and criticise this motion. Paragraph (b) of the motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Western Australia contributes 10 per cent of federal fuel levies, or $780 million annually, but receives only $150 million from the Commonwealth in return</PARA>
<PARA>We can argue until we are blue in the face about what that money should be spent on, but when we have such a huge discrepancy in terms of the contribution which is collected from that tax, and a tax it is, going back into the state we have to ask ourselves why anybody from the state of Western Australia, where of course Senator Panizza and I come from, would argue against that proposition. I can understand why somebody on this side of the country might say, `Well, that is good for us' and argue that it not be changed, but I am darned if I can understand the proposition that we have just heard from Senator McKiernan and Senator Margetts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As usual, they skirted all around the motion. They talked about a whole range of things. I would welcome a debate on rail, I would welcome a debate on greenhouse gas emissions, and no doubt from time to time they will put up motions and we will debate those particular things. But this motion before the chamber today relates to road funding. I can understand somebody expanding that to how it impacts on their state, and I think that is quite reasonable, but senators in their contributions have wandered all over the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome Senator McKiernan's comments about advising our transport minister in Western Australia, Eric Charlton, that there is an offer in terms of the Eyre Highway, but I can assure members of this chamber that one of the very hyperactive members of the current coalition government in Western Australia is Eric Charlton. You can bet your boots that the Hon. Eric Charlton will receive those comments; I will make sure that they are sent to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a comment about the fuel excise. It is a tax on the tyranny of distance. It is a tax on the exporters of this country; in other words, it is a tax on the producers. It is a tax on those people who produce the wealth. It seriously impacts on Australia's ability to compete as a nation. As such, I believe it is a tax that really needs to be revisited, relooked at and redefined. One can understand if the tax was being totally utilised for roads or for the infrastructure of a number of areas, but currently it is not. It has become a milking cow for the federal government. The largest proportion of it&mdash;something like 80 per cent&mdash;is spent on programs particularly in Melbourne and Sydney. As such, I think that it is very unfair to the wealth producers and those people who live in rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to Senator Faulkner about incorporating tables in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The first deals with figures for road funding and the petroleum products excise as they have occurred over the years. The second gives constant 1993-94 figures in dollars. The relevant fact in this incorporation is that, back in 1980-81, 87.9 per cent of the fuel excise that was collected went back into roads. In 1993-94, 12.1 per cent went into roads. The estimate for 1994-95 is 8.7 per cent. In other words, over 90 per cent of funding is being spent on things other than roads. The estimate for 1995-96 is 8.8 per cent, and for 1996-97 it is 8.7 per cent. Those forward estimates are fairly constant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now I want to deal with some facts which Senator McKiernan laid on the table. A massive $7.3 billion is collected annually across Australia through federal fuel excise. WA contributes more than 10 per cent to that $780 million, but receives just $150 million from the Commonwealth for road works. Another fact worth noting is that, in the 13 months to August, the federal fuel excise rose by 7c a litre to 33c a litre. The Commonwealth has increased revenue collection by $1.5 billion as a result of the increases, with Western Australia paying an additional $160 million a year. Not one cent of that collection has been returned to the roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National highway funding is a disgrace. WA is responsible for maintaining 25 per cent of the nation's highway systems. The Commonwealth is responsible for providing the funds. However, WA was allocated a meagre $58 million, or seven per cent of the total national funding pool of $820 million provided by the Commonwealth for highways. WA needs at least an extra $40 million a year in funding to rebuild poor sections of the national highway system to meet the standards set down by the Commonwealth. Yet the government is refusing to put that money back into the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In real terms, Western Australia is receiving $50 million less per annum in Commonwealth funding than the average funding levels of the previous 10 years, yet Western Australia's road assets, which would cost $14 billion to replace, are declining at the alarming rate of $80 million a year. I submit that that is a disgrace when we look at the total funds collected from the fuel excise. I also point out that it is a coincidence that Western Australia provides 25 per cent of the national highway system and 25 per cent of the export income of this nation. That probably fits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no argument with what Senator Margetts said in terms of bulk commodities, such as iron ore and woodchips. What she forgets is that, in terms of smallgoods, livestock, wool and a host of other things, it is far cheaper, more efficient and quicker to transport them by road. Senator Panizza gave us a figure on this in his contribution. He said that 30 per cent of the freight between the east and west is carried by road and 70 per cent is carried by ship or rail. I suggest that that would be the situation in Western Australia. The figure for road freight in Western Australia may be 40 per cent because a lot of areas in Western Australia do not have rail services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think someone mentioned shifting bricks from Perth to Darwin. It might surprise some senators&mdash;but certainly not the Western Australian senators, except for Senator Margetts&mdash;that there does not happen to be a railway line between Perth and Darwin. It would not be economical to build a railway line between Perth and Darwin. When we have to put up with that sort of contribution which is absolute and total nonsense, it makes one wonder why we raise these matters at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with what I see as a major crisis in Western Australia. I have no doubt that other senators will make a contribution about how it affects their particular states. We have to be careful when people try to delineate between city and country. I will give an example of a city figure. The average daily figure for traffic across the causeway has risen by 20,000 vehicles over the last 15 years to 103,000 vehicles per day. In three decades, traffic over the route is expected to top 130,000 vehicles per day. However, less money is being put back into the system to cope with that increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can criticise the situation as much as we like. Senator McKiernan criticised the proposal through Northbridge, Western Australia. Something has to be worked out. Senator McKiernan did not come up with a better proposal. That situation has been looked at by top engineers in Western Australia. I acknowledge and agree with one thing that Senator McKiernan said. He said that our main roads administration and its application to its task has no peer in Australia. I do not accept his criticism about those people, good as they might be, seeking overseas expertise to be even better. That seems fairly logical to me when you look at the funds that are spent on the road system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally reject the comment of Senator Cook that it was a junket. The members of the Labor Party in Western Australia are the last ones on this earth to talk about junkets. We had 10 years of that before the Court government came to power. At least we now have a state government in Western Australia that has set about reducing the debt of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look at the decline in federal funding to Western Australia in respect of national highways, untied funds and local government allocations. In 1992-93, it was $212.69 million. In 1993-94, it had dropped to $150.74 million, which is a drop of $62 million. In 1994, it stayed about the same at $153.78 million. In fact, it went up by about $3 million. So, in effect, we have seen in the two years following 1992-93 a drop of over $100 million in funding, yet there is an increased task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts, in her contribution, talked about the funding relative to where the money was going to be spent. But let us tell the whole story. It is true that there is going to be about half the money spent roughly in the region of the metropolitan area of Perth, or in the metropolitan area of Perth if you include the Kwinana Freeway down to Bunbury. There is the Kwinana Freeway, the Fremantle eastern bypass&mdash;which has long been called out for by many people&mdash;the Burswood road and bridge, Jerretus Street, the completion of the ring-road and the duplication of the Great Eastern Highway from the city to Guildford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the other part of it. None of this is remotely near the city, as was suggested. There is the Derby to Wyndham road. I do not know how many miles that is from Perth, but it would certainly be a couple of thousand miles. There is the Nanutarra-Munjina road, the Bunbury ring-road, the Albany-Lake Grace road, the South Western Highway, the Geraldton bypass and the Perth-Bunbury highway. So when we look at the allocation and the requirement in what is required in Western Australia, we find that there is a balance of approximately the same dollars between the requirements of the metropolitan area and the requirements of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other roads&mdash;in particular, the national highway system, the Orange route to the Great Eastern Highway, the Great Northern Highway, the Southern Cross-Norseman road&mdash;which Senator Panizza would be very interested in&mdash;the Newman-Meekatharra road, the Broome-Fitzroy Crossing road and the Halls Creek-Kununurra road. The list goes on. There is Yampire Gorge, Karijini Park, Point Gregory, Kalbarri, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in dealing with these particular aspects, it is important that, if you come in here to debate these particular things, you actually debate the facts and the figures. We have not seen that from either Senator McKiernan or Senator Margetts in terms of the situation which exists in Western Australia. I acknowledge that Senator McKiernan&mdash;and I do have some of his letters, as he said, from some of the shire councils, and I have no doubt that he has some of mine&mdash;has sought to get more funding for Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put another perspective on this in terms of figures. From 1920 to 1960 Western Australia used to receive about 19 per cent of the share in terms of road funding from the Commonwealth. From 1960 to 1970 it dropped to 17.7 per cent. From 1970 to 1995 there has been a steady decline to where it now is under 10 per cent. So whatever way one looks at it and however one analyses these particular figures, one can only come to the conclusion that steadily and very systematically the Commonwealth&mdash;particularly this government in the last 10 years, as I quoted the particular figures earlier from the sheet that I incorporated and the documents I tabled&mdash;has in the last 10 or 11 years reduced very significantly the contribution to the road systems in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza's motion has an enormous amount of merit. The words set down in this motion have allowed us to debate the way this government has set about, as I said earlier in my contribution, taxing the tyranny of distance, taxing the exporters of this country and taxing their ability to become competitive in international markets. One could go on with these points and put more figures down in relation to this. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, at the end of the day, one can only say that, unless this government&mdash;and it will not be here for much longer&mdash;starts addressing some of the enormous cost impediments it has put on industry in this county, we will continue to see the sorts of problems we have had with our current account. We will see our gross national product shrink in real terms. We will not have much impact on unemployment, if any. We will see, as was predicted in the papers today, interest rates head up in the housing sector, for example, towards 13 per cent and the flow-on impact that will come onto small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Senator Panizza for introducing this motion and I condemn the federal government for the way it has treated Western Australia, and probably most states&mdash;although I do not have the figures for them. I will listen with interest to other contributions on that. I certainly condemn the government with regard to its funding contribution to the national highway system in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza's motion undoubtedly was triggered by the floods on the Nullarbor. Had those floods not occurred, it is quite possible that we would not be debating this matter this afternoon. I was pleased that, although the motion which we are debating did not mention the cutting of the rail link, Senator Panizza did bring rail into the debate. He indicated that he was concerned about the cutting of the rail link as well as the road link. Both these links to Western Australia have been cut. That, undoubtedly, is a significant problem for people wanting to move between the eastern states and Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have very consistently supported the development of a national transport policy. In that policy there must be, in our view, very heavy emphasis on rail. That is why I was pleased to hear Senator Panizza pick that point up when he spoke to this motion. As well as the emphasis on rail, a national transport policy has to take into account such things as the availability of fuel to drive the transport system over time. It must take into account the externalities of that transport system. I think that most people in this place would believe that there should be a full user pays policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only by putting the right price signals into the costs of things that one has a proper distribution of resources, including the resource of transport. When one looks at those externalities, one sees the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. That point has already been picked up. One also sees the externalities in relation to deaths and injuries which occur in various transport modes; and the damage to property which occurs through the use of transport of various sorts. That varies considerably between the different modes. I will return to that point in a moment. One must also take into account the longer term consequences of the national transport policy, whatever that policy is. We would certainly be critical of the government for not developing a comprehensive national transport policy. That is the point at which we would share some of Senator Panizza's concerns&mdash;although certainly not all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In listening particularly to Senator Panizza, and later to Senator McKiernan, God came in for quite a beating because the floods were put down to an act of God. I would like to briefly pick up the real possibility that these floods may not be an act of God, but may be very much an act of man. As I have said many times in this place, many of the climatic changes which we have seen in recent years cannot scientifically be put down to greenhouse changes, changes in the composition of the atmosphere leading to greenhouse warming. Nonetheless, many scientists are of the view that the changes we are seeing are at least consistent with what we would expect under a greenhouse phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the floods in this connection, one observes that there have been very significant increases in the sea temperatures in the Timor Sea. Not just over the last one year but over the last four years one has seen a change in the weather patterns which has led to floods not only on the Nullarbor but down into South Australia during summertime. Typical summertime weather patterns are going right across the continent, from the Kimberleys and down into the eastern part of Western Australia and into South Australia and, at times, including Adelaide. I think some senators in this place will recall that Lake Torrens just north of Port Augusta only a few years ago filled for the first time since European settlement. It filled for the first time in the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to bring home here to the opposition is that when one raises the issue of greenhouse one finds from the opposition a very consistent opposition to any programs which would effectively tackle greenhouse. Yet we have inherent in this motion from Senator Panizza a suggestion that we need to spend more on addressing perhaps the consequences of greenhouse, namely the flooding of the Nullarbor and the cutting of both the road and the rail link, while ignoring the very thing that he is proposing: an increase in road transport with its consequent increase in the use of fossil fuel&mdash;an unnecessary increase in fossil fuel because there are other alternatives. That may indeed exacerbate the very conditions, which will increase the possibility of floods and will make the solutions which he is suggesting untenable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the comparison between rail and road, there is no doubt, and I think Senator Margetts mentioned this earlier, that per tonne and per kilometre travelled rail is a great deal more efficient than road transport. A number of examples have already been given of rail transport. In terms of human safety and safety to property, there is abundant evidence that rail is a great deal more gentle in relation to human life and limb and protection of property than road transport. Again, it seems to me and certainly to the Democrats that this emphasis on a linking of the amount of tax raised on fuel to spending on roads is perhaps the wrong way to go. If one sees that rather as something that should be spent more broadly in addressing a broad transport policy, one would have a great deal more sympathy for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, one might observe in passing that the tax paid on the diesel fuel used by the rail system actually finishes up being spent not on the rail system but on subsidising the road system. One might observe also in passing that the way in which rail and road are funded militates very much against the effective and efficient running of the rail system. While roads are paid for out of grants, whether those grants come from general revenue or whether they come from general revenue by way of a moiety from the fuel tax, does not matter. The roads are paid for, and the cost of those roads does not have to be refunded by the road users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of rail, it must raise revenue by borrowing and the interest on those borrowings has to be repaid. When one looks at the apparent economic costs of rail compared with road, one is forced to the conclusion that the comparison is very difficult to do and the comparison appears to show that rail is much less economically efficient than road, whereas in fact a great deal of that difference relates quite simply to the way in which the two systems are funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks broadly at transport, one can find a great number of other areas in which Australia should be spending a lot more than it does at the moment. Somebody earlier&mdash;it might have been Senator Crane&mdash;talked about taking bricks from Perth to Darwin. Of course, there is no rail link. More importantly, one could observe that there is no rail link between Alice Springs and Darwin. Roughly 1,700 kilometres of roadway must be traversed by heavy road transport because there is no rail link. From the point of view of a national transport system, from the point of view of national security, it would seem to us to make a great deal of sense to spend money to at least complete a rail system which was fast and efficient and which connected all the major centres of population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently travelled by rail between Adelaide and Tailem Bend, which is just the other side of Murray Bridge, because the rail unions in South Australia were absolutely appalled at the conditions under which that main line, which is part of the main line between Adelaide and Melbourne, was operated. I was told&mdash;and I have confirmed since&mdash;that the last time that track was significantly upgraded in terms of alignment was in 1927. It is a single line which winds its way up through the Adelaide Hills, passes over a point which is almost the highest point in the range, goes from sea level up to the top of the range, and by the time it gets to Murray Bridge it is almost down to sea level again. It is incredibly inefficient and terribly time consuming. Of course, it is an enormous impediment to transport between Adelaide and Melbourne. So that is another area in which we believe a very significant improvement could be made which would go a great deal further to improve the transport system than simply spending more money on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being in Canberra at the moment, one could reflect on the Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne line and the inefficiencies with respect to both the position of the track&mdash;the tortuous nature of that right of way through much of its course&mdash;and the slowness of the links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned in passing the internalisation of externalities. In relation to road transport, of course, one of the major externalities is the much, much higher rate of accidents, causing both deaths and injuries, on the roads, compared with rail. I have in front of me a summary of the total costs of road accidents in 1988. The figures happen to be very similar to the costs for 1994. They show that the overall cost of road accidents was over $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, I do not have the figures for Western Australia, or figures which are disaggregated by state, but if one were to take into account the population of Western Australia compared with other states, one would have to assume that the cost of road accidents in Western Australia would be about $700 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to me eminently sensible for that sort of cost to be borne by those who cause members of the society to expose themselves to that cost&mdash;that is, the road users. That is an externality which should be internalised. Again, I come back to the point that to claim that all the money from fuel taxes should be spent on roads is to ignore this major cost which the use of that fuel and the use of the vehicles makes necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite reasonable that that $6.1 billion, which comes out of general revenue but which is imposed on the general revenue by the use of road transport, should also be borne by the users of the road. Why should children, age pensioners who do not drive, those who do not cause the society to have that cost imposed on them, have to pay that out of their general taxes? It should, of course, be paid by the road users. It is an externality and it should be internalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I return to the point that we would support a national transport policy. We believe that we do not have a national transport policy. It must be built around rail. It must be a great deal more energy efficient because of the incipient greenhouse effect. Therefore, it needs to look to these more efficient forms of transporting both goods and people. We need to bear in mind in this transport policy the costs of the importation of fossil fuels as long as we are using fossil fuels. That also runs into several billions of dollars. That is an impost on our foreign exchange. All those factors would lead one to adopt a policy rather different from that implied by the motion before us this afternoon from Senator Panizza. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting Senator Panizza's motion. I do it as an eastern stater. The motion condemns the government for the poor treatment Western Australia has received into relation to road funding. I support the motion because I think the Western Australians are correct, because the same sort of situation applies in my own state of Queensland and because I have responsibility for regional development and infrastructure on behalf of the coalition. This motion, although related to Western Australia, typifies the poor deal that regional Australia has received from this government in relation to the funding of highways and the tax rip-off this government achieves from people who are forced, in many cases because of where they live, to use their vehicles and to use fuel. Therefore, they find themselves contributing far more to the general revenue than people who are fortunate enough to live in the cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Senator Panizza and Senator Crane for raising this matter. It is a matter of very great interest to their state. I also congratulate the Local Government Association of Western Australia and the Western Australian Municipal Association on their campaign to get some justice and equity to road users in their state. They are extending that campaign with the help of local government peak bodies in every other state across the nation. It is a very worthwhile campaign. I congratulate them for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics Senator Panizza includes in his motion are both interesting and telling. I have some different sets of statistics which are also interesting. Although the figures do not line up exactly in all instances, because they are for different years and are from different bases, they are interesting. In Western Australia, for example, 143,143 kilometres of roads are open for general traffic: 43,134 of those are sealed; 45,955 are unsealed; some 36,000-odd are formed and another 17,000 are cleared. In the total of Australia, there are 816,369 kilometres of roads open for general traffic. Of that total, only 291,031 kilometres are sealed roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount paid, according to figures provided to me by the research service, by the various states in the whole of the Commonwealth for petrol and diesel excise is $8,408,800,000 per annum. Western Australia has contributed $1.2 billion towards that total petrol and diesel excise bill. So $1.2 billion comes from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same set of figures shows that in 1993-94&mdash;which was the year I quoted for those receipts&mdash;Western Australia received a measly $77.3 million in Commonwealth road funding.  In the whole of Australia, Australians paid $8.4 billion in petrol and diesel excise and the Commonwealth paid out $1.014 billion in road funding. So $7 billion out of that petrol and diesel excise just went to the general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is unfair to those Australians who, simply because of where they live, have got to use their vehicles more often than others. Those people who have to use their vehicles more and, because they live distant from the capital cities or distant from the ports, require the necessities of life to be transported to them by road have to pay that extra fuel tax which goes straight to the general revenue. It is debilitating to those of us who live in regional Australia. We all pay income tax, the same as everybody else. But, in addition, because we are required to rely on road transport more often, we pay an extra amount to the general revenue. That is simply unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I note in passing that, when this government came to office, fuel excise was about 7c a litre and it is now 33c a litre. When this government came to office most of the excise, or a good percentage of it, was spent on roads. But now under this government the fuel excise is simply just another revenue collector. It is an absolute disgrace for a government which criticised our consumption tax&mdash;the GST&mdash;so much and told so many lies about it to simply rip off the Australian public with this indirect consumption tax which falls most heavily on those less able to afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always distressed to find the Australian Democrats urging the Labor Party on when it comes to taxing those who can least afford to pay. The Democrats want to help the Labor Party all the time to rip more and more taxes off those who live in regional Australia, those who live in the areas which contribute a major proportion of Australia's wealth. The Democrats are on record as proposing that, on top of the 33c a litre fuel tax that the Labor Party has already imposed, there should be put another 17c a litre to make a total fuel tax of about 50c a litre or more. If we could take that off, imagine a boon it would be for people in regional Australia, for people who are required to use their cars and who have to rely on road transport for the basic necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Of those figures that I mentioned earlier, it is interesting to note which government is responsible for roads. As we are dealing with Western Australia, I might point out that in Western Australia the federal government has responsibility for 4,634 kilometres of roads, the state government has responsibility for 19,596 kilometres of roads and local authorities have responsibility for 118,820 kilometres of roads. For the whole of Australia, the federal government is responsible for 18,479 kilometres, state governments around the country are responsible for 151,867 kilometres and local governments are responsible for a massive 620,247 kilometres of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> According to these statistics, the amount attributed to Western Australia in national highway allocations and untied federal funds was $58.13 million; state, $43.4 million; and local authorities, $51.45 million. Whichever way you look at it, the Commonwealth rips off an enormous amount from road users and gives back very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One good thing the Labor Party did, once upon a time, was introduce the black spots program. That came in in 1991. Mr Robert Brown, the then Minister for Land Transport, said that it was `one of the most outstanding programs for road safety that has ever been adopted by any government in Australia'. I agree with him, but what happened to it? The Keating government terminated that program in 1993. That is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Senator Coulter talked about safety aspects. If some decent amounts of money were spent on the road system, then, as that black spots program proved, you would not have those accidents and there would not be that enormous cost to the Australian public. For every $500,000 spent on the black spots program, one life was saved. Each road fatality costs Australia $631,000 and the black spots program is estimated to have saved 540 lives and saved Australia some $340 million. That black spots program cost only $270 million. We can see that there was a tremendous return for that outlay. Unfortunately, the Labor government terminated that program in June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That project had other good flow-on effects in the jobs it created, both directly and indirectly. The road sector has the highest employment generating capacity of all sectors which produce a physical product of economic value. Why did the Labor Party, after introducing the program with a lot of fanfare in the 1990 election, drop it? It is because it has no interest in the road users, particularly those road users in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the additional costs of poor roads and the huge fuel excise and the fuel tax that the Labor Party rips off, which debilitates people in regional and rural Australia, there is damage to the vehicles of people in remote and regional Australia caused by the poor condition of our roads. That is a cost which city people do not have to bear. People in the country have to spend much more on repairs and maintenance because of the standard of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard of the roads, or their lack of any standard, also makes it more difficult, time consuming and costly to get goods from the farm, the factory and the mine to the ports. That additional cost makes us less competitive in those products which we export overseas. If we are less competitive, we sell less. If we sell less, we earn less. If we earn less, we have fewer jobs. Of course, we have an increasing balance of payments problem and increasing foreign debt. So if we could get some decent roads and get our goods from the productive parts of Australia to the ports easily and more cheaply, it would be much better in all aspects of Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand there is legislation that needs to be dealt with at an early date so, much as there are many other things I would like to address on this subject, I will curtail my remarks. In doing so, I simply say to the government that it really should look at the cost of fuel in Australia and at why there is such a wide variation in fuel prices. This has been looked at time and again by any number of inquiries. I see the Labor Party in the New South Wales election promising to do it again. The Labor government does not need more inquiries; it just needs to take some action. Something like terminal grade pricing would be very beneficial. If it could get rid of that Laidley agreement, which was a blackmail attempt, I understand, by the unions to hold Australia to ransom yet again, then it would find that there would be more competition in the petrol distribution network, which would lead to cheaper prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to indicate that, as the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure, I am currently looking at the announced direction of the coalition on reinvesting within Australia a portion of the proceeds of privatisation in the linking Australia program that has been announced. That is something where we do want to pour back into infrastructure within Australia some of the proceeds of privatisation&mdash;in projects that will give a return to the nation. Major infrastructure projects are the things we are looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, in passing, that Senator Coulter was talking about the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. It is probably worth putting on record that I think the Democrats in the South Australian state parliament were a part of the deal with the rotten Labor government back there a few years ago that spent some $850 million on the Myer-REMM office building in Adelaide. It is currently worth, as I understand it, $150 million. So no wonder the State Bank which financed it went broke. The state government spent $850 on it&mdash;it is now worth $150 million&mdash;but for that $850 million the government could have built the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. That state government at the time was interested, as this government is, only in the flash projects. It was not interested in the real projects that give a return to the nation. So we still do not have that Darwin to Alice Springs railway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Senate to support the motion. I think it is a very worthwhile motion and one that, no matter that it relates particularly to Western Australia, all senators should support. I certainly urge the Senate to vote that way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza is to be congratulated and endorsed for his motion, because he is showing himself to be an on-the-ground type of politician, particularly when he mentions the Eyre Highway, or highway No. 1. Senator Coulter talked about misrepresentation. Senator Coulter tried to claim that the greenhouse effect is to blame for the destruction of the Eyre Highway. In other words, the cyclone came about because of these new weather patterns resulting from the greenhouse effect. That is a great misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point Senator Panizza was trying to make&mdash;everyone else understood it except Senator Coulter&mdash;is that the destruction the cyclone brought upon highway No. 1 was exacerbated by the fact that the road had already deteriorated. The floods that affected that highway exacerbated its destruction. In fact, it is still flooded to this day. There is great concern for the people in those districts in relation to communications and simple day-to-day supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is in every state. Every state can come up with examples of federal highways in deterioration. My state of Victoria is no exception. One can follow the money trail back to the Treasury and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). While this government collects well over $10 billion in revenue through petroleum taxes, as has been said by previous speakers, it only spends about $800 million or $820 million on road funding. To put that into perspective, since 1992-93&mdash;the time that Paul Keating became Prime Minister and took the reins of the Treasury&mdash;funding has halved while the collection of excise taxes has increased to the tune of $4 billion to $5 billion. He has halved road funding yet increased excise taxes. Where has that money gone? It has gone straight into consolidated revenue. It is nothing more than a tax grab simply to finance the government's other excessive and wasted expenditure in its budget. </PARA>

All those types of micro activities would bring about a better environment. </PARA>

But on this particular point, the Prime Minister's promise to upgrade the rail system never arrived&mdash;the $450 million never arrived. So both systems are degraded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan, an old unionist, should realise that a good and efficient road system is good for employment. It is estimated that some 96,000 people are directly employed in constructing, maintaining and administering Australia's road system. Road construction ranks equal second out of all the industrial sectors in job creation. For every $1 million spent on roads, it is estimated that an extra 35 jobs are accompanied by the savings of $350,000 in unemployment benefits. So good roads are good for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good roads and a good, efficient upgraded road system are, overall, good for the economy. It is estimated that transport reforms would bring about a potential 3.1 per cent increase in GDP if they were implemented in full. Road pricing would add 16 per cent of that 3.1 per cent. So that is the contribution a good and efficient road system would bring to our economy&mdash;it would just simply and properly add to the GDP growth in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pretty basic economics that, if you can transport your loads on an efficient road system, you will get them to port a lot cheaper and a lot faster. As mentioned by Senator Macdonald, good and efficient roads are good for safety; they are good for lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great disappointments with respect to roads was the abolition of the black spots program. As I travel around country Victoria, whenever the subject of roads comes up, the black spots program is inevitably mentioned. It was probably the only kudos the government ever received. Regardless of the fact that the program was brought in under another name&mdash;a former minister for roads, Ralph Hunt, a National Party member, brought it in during the Fraser years&mdash;it was a good and honourable program and a reaction to a problem. But, sadly, it was abolished. Most people say, `When you get back into government, there is one thing you can do: bring back the black spots program.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Macdonald said, for every $500,000 spent on the black spots program one life was saved. Each road fatality costs Australia $631,000. That is a great deal of money. The black spots program is estimated to have saved 540 lives in its short time, at a cost of $340 million. That is the cost of saving those Australian lives in dollar terms, let alone in social and emotional terms. The black spots program cost only $270 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the government's credit, it had originally outlaid $110 million. It increased that figure as it went along because of its success. But enter Paul Keating. The program was abolished in June 1993. I can assure you that when we get into government we&mdash;particularly country senators and country representatives&mdash;will be pushing very hard for its return. That is one program you can be sure will come back on to the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give my colleague Senator O'Chee a chance to sum up. He will have a lot to say about the government's very poor and pathetic contribution. If Senator O'Chee bears with me for one moment&mdash;there is a great deal of material on the government's failure&mdash;I want to include the state of Victoria. We cannot let the Western Australians have it all. I have some very potent figures here in relation to my state of Victoria. I will just run through them very quickly and finish on that note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the national highway strategy request from Victoria. That request is that the sum that the Victorian road authority has determined is the sum needed to maintain the national highway infrastructure, which is the responsibility of the federal government, in the state at a level determined to be necessary by the federal government's advisers. It put in a simple request for $221 million in order to maintain the federal highways in Victoria. In return, it received $135.7 million. The federal highways are the only responsibility of this government, yet the Victorian government cannot even get the required funds to maintain them at a level that the federal government advisers want. So it is $85 million short. I think those figures say it all. Victoria is getting just as ripped off as Western Australia is. For that reason I give my full endorsement to Senator Panizza's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is a matter of vital importance. The road infrastructure of this country has continued to be eroded by Labor's lack of commitment to spending money on the things that count&mdash;spending money on building infrastructure to create jobs and opportunities for Australians. When Senator Panizza brings this motion before the chamber, as he quite correctly has, it is more than just a condemnation of spending on roads. It is a condemnation of the government's failure to spend on investing for the future. That is what the road network of this country is: it is an investment in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we speak, I note that we are on broadcast. This is drivetime in Western Australia. If you are sitting in a traffic jam in Western Australia&mdash;tick, tick, tick as the clock goes by&mdash;remember one simple fact: you are sitting in a traffic jam because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Labor government will not allocate funds to maintain Western Australia's road network. That is the simple truth of this matter. The Prime Minister and the Labor government are responsible for the traffic situation in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where Western Australia needs an injection of $100 million a year over the next decade to maintain its road network. That is the only way to address the consequence of Labor's failure to properly fund the road network in that state over the last 12 years. But it is not forthcoming from this government because Labor's representatives from Western Australia have what they consider to be more important ways to spend the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example, let us take one of the ideas brought forward by one of Labor's representatives from Western Australia&mdash;someone whom honourable senators would think would have an understanding of the problems with the road network. I am referring to the former Premier of Western Australia, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). Dr Carmen Lawrence has come to the parliament with a great reputation. She was made minister responsible for Australia's health. As though there were not enough crying problems with Australia's health, this minister decided to spend over $250,000 on what she calls a safe sex guide&mdash;what most of us would call a sick sex guide. That is how the Labor Party seems to find the priorities for public spending in this country: spend money on a sick sex guide instead of spending money on things that count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that a pretty poor performance from a representative of Western Australia. We had another pretty poor performance in this place this afternoon from another representative of Western Australia, Senator McKiernan. He is not going to vote for this motion. His objection to this motion was some sort of rabid nonsense; that he did not like Mr Eric Charlton, the Minister for Transport in Western Australia because he said he was going to drive road trains right into the centre of Perth. What a lot of nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Charlton has done&mdash;and what the coalition government in Western Australia should be commended for&mdash;is run road trains into Kewdale, which is an integrated transport centre, so as to relieve road pressure in the rest of the metropolitan area. In that way a lot of transhipment operations can be centralised, and that is only good for the state. But, of course, Senator McKiernan is not going to vote for it and the Labor Party is not going to vote for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address this report. This report is a result of a supplementary hearing that the Senate ordered to have certain answers provided in relation to the National Media Liaison Service. Most people would be aware that the National Media Liaison Service is referred to as aNiMaLS. The reason for that is that there are many people on this side of the chamber in particular and many journalists throughout this country who are absolutely convinced that the National Media Liaison Service, which spends in excess of $1.5 million worth of taxpayers' funds, is in fact not a liaison service but rather a propaganda machine for Labor Party purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The genesis of the supplementary hearings was founded on a Senate resolution because the Senate did not believe that satisfactory answers had been given. Indeed, at the first lot of estimates hearings to do with the National Media Liaison Service the minister present, the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), could not even tell the estimates hearing what the budget was. He was asked: what is the total global figure? He did not know; he was unable to tell. If we are to have a Senate estimates committee system that is operative and that does provide for accountability within this country, then we ought to have a minister that is able to provide answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister on that occasion did not have Mr Epstein, the Director of the National Media Liaison Service, present either. The government, in its usual style, using its numbers, signed a report on the supplementary hearings, but I submit to the Senate that the minority report signed by me and three other colleagues is in fact the more cogent report and deals with the situation very effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the minority report dealt with the absolute and utter farce of Mr Epstein claiming that he was not the Director of the National Media Liaison Service&mdash;he absolutely denied it. He said, `That is not my role. My directory is director of the Ministerial Media Group.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our minority report summarises the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Evidence was clearly provided to the committee which showed that Mr Epstein's employment minister, the Minister for Finance, Kim Beazley, described Mr Epstein as the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. So the minister who employs him got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, who represents the Minister for Finance in this chamber, also got it wrong. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ministerial Directory</EMPHASIS> got it wrong. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Government Directory</EMPHASIS> got it wrong. The phone book got it wrong. It was absolutely extraordinary that somebody would come before a Senate estimates committee and seek to deny that his role was that of the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Epstein was confronted as to why this error was allowed to come into Mr Beazley's letters, Senator McMullan's letters, and a whole host of documents, he said&mdash;this is recorded on page 62 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have attempted on a number of occasions, by telephone, to persuade the people handling the parliament phone book that they have got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA>I then made the comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But communication is your expertise, is it not? And you still have not corrected it within two and a half years!</PARA>
<PARA>The latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Communications Directory</EMPHASIS>, published February 1995, lists at page 127 `National Media Liaison Service&mdash;Director&mdash;Mr Epstein, David'. So we have that mistake repeated yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders why Mr Epstein wants to deny the fact that he is the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. It is very interesting, when you do a bit of research, because I was wrong when I said that Mr Epstein had 2 1/2 years to fix this up. In fact, it is in excess of 3 1/2 years, or thereabouts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a question on notice from Senator Alston on 14 November 1991, former Senator Graham Richardson admitted that Mr Epstein was in fact the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. So former Senator Richardson had no compunction about saying that Mr Epstein is the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. Mr Beazley had none, Senator McMullan had none, and all these directories have none. Then, for some reason we have Mr Epstein trying to deny that he is the Director of the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that in my former life as a lawyer I would love to have had such a wealth of evidence to put in front of a jury because I have no doubt what the verdict would have been. It would have been guilty, guilty, guilty on each count of misleading the Senate estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that I want to touch on is the absolute denial by Mr Epstein that the National Media Liaison Service was used for political purposes&mdash;categorically denied by him and by the Minister for Administrative Services. In question time today I asked a question of the minister in relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ALP Communications Directory</EMPHASIS>, in which Gary Gray, the national secretary, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Communications Directory lists the names, phone numbers . . . of the most influential people in the ALP . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We hope that the directory assists you in finding your way around the Labor Party . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Surprise, surprise, in the index, page 46, who do we find? It is none other than the National Media Liaison Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the question is asked: how does the National Media Liaison Service assist people in finding their way around the Australian Labor Party? Why is it that Gary Gray says that this document lists the influential people and bodies within the ALP? It lists the ACTU, state parliamentary members and federal parliamentary members&mdash;all people and bodies to do with the Labor Party. Smack bang in the middle on page 46 is the National Media Liaison Service, which the minister was assuring us at a Senate estimates committee was a dinky-di public service completely divorced from Labor Party politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why didn't he have the health department in this directory? Why didn't he have the primary industry department in this directory? Why weren't all the other Public Service agencies referred to in this Labor Party directory? The answer is very simple and very clear: the National Media Liaison Service is used by the Australian Labor Party for its own party political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you may recall the answer given by Senator McMullan. In typical style, he could not answer the substance of the question, so what did he say? He said, `I wouldn't mind if the Liberal Party put the National Media Liaison Service into its directory,' and then he sat down. A very short answer to avoid the substance of the question!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did I do? I moved that the Senate take note of that answer and, in response, Senator McMullan then admitted that, in the next issue of the ALP <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Communications Directory</EMPHASIS>, it had taken out the reference to the National Media Liaison Service because it was an error. It should not have been in there in the first place. If that is the case, it should not be in a Liberal Party directory, either. He was too smart by half with the answers he gave and, I submit, misled the Senate and the people of Australia. The Labor Party has been caught out in relation to the National Media Liaison Service. It is clearly a vehicle for the Australian Labor Party to peddle its propaganda, giving itself a $1.5 million advantage over the Liberal Party. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commented partly on this report last week, and I would like to conclude my remarks on it tonight. Last week, I was in the process of explaining that political life as such will never appeal to everyone and, therefore, it is extremely unlikely that we will have very large numbers of both men and women stampeding to nominate for election to the federal parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I was very interested in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, which brought forward reasons for women not advancing in business management. To my mind the reasons advanced in that report could also be applied to politics. It stated one of those reasons was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that women, be they at work or elsewhere, put at least as much emphasis on the value of interpersonal relations as on building a successful career.</PARA>
<PARA>To build interpersonal relations you obviously need to be with your family and, as we all know, that is not possible all the time in federal politics. The other reason it put forward was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the chance of women winning their way to the top is heavily constrained by society's view of what constitutes appropriate female and male roles, especially when it comes to looking after children.</PARA>
<PARA>I point out that, although this has changed to some extent in my experience of candidacy in politics, it still has not changed to an enormous extent and women are still constrained by their role in that regard and, therefore, do not particularly look to a career in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I said before, the ALP has advocated the use of quotas. The coalition does not support the use of quotas. Without trying to antagonise Senator Crowley too much, I would like to point out that we have selected many women candidates in winnable ALP marginal seats for the next federal election.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is, as Senator Abetz correctly points out, that they are winnable seats. It is no use preselecting women for seats that they cannot win. It is a waste of everyone's time if we want to get more women in parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two winnable seats in Victoria, two winnable seats in South Australia, three winnable seats in New South Wales and two winnable seats in Queensland. Those women who have won preselection for those seats have been identified and encouraged to pursue a career in politics. We have done that without the use of quotas. Similarly to the ALP, we would like to see a better balance of women in parliament. But this is the way we believe it should be done&mdash;through identification, encouragement and then preselection of those women from the field of candidates who choose to preselect for that seat. So it is totally open competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any definitive answers as to the most foolproof way of increasing the number of women in parliament, but we need to be continually looking at how far we have come and not stop evaluating ways of achieving our aims. But only by choosing women on merit will they gain the credibility and respect needed to maintain and increase the numbers of women parliamentarians. It is to be hoped that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will in the future take a more positive role and, I would hope, make more positive comments in its approach to this very important matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some splendid young people in this country and I wish to take just a moment to mention four of them&mdash;three of them young Canberrans&mdash;who are going to a music festival in St Petersburg to participate in an international youth music festival, the Virtuosi of the Year 2000 competition, being held in March of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very prestigious competition and auditions were called for nationally. Five Australian students were selected as being of sufficient standard to compete. Four of them have taken up the offer, and three of these come from the Canberra School of Music. The festival has attracted students from Russia, the Ukraine, Germany, Holland, Italy, the USA, Finland, Austria, Korea, Japan, and France. So we can be proud, indeed, of these young people, the five who were selected, four of whom will be attending representing Australia to participate and, hopefully, do very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition is judged by an international jury consisting of prominent musicians from all of the countries competing. John Luxton, who is head of the keyboard department of the Canberra School of Music, has this year been invited to be one of the jurors. We commend him also for his achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three students from the Canberra School of Music are, firstly, Lachlan Redd, aged 20 years, a pianist in the third year of his Bachelor of Music course, who later this year apparently will be on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quest</EMPHASIS> program. Secondly, Judith Hurst, 16 years of age, is a violinist who has done all her music training in the pre-tertiary program of the Canberra School of Music and for many years has been a scholarship holder there; last year she was the runner-up in the national youth concerto competition in Brisbane. Thirdly, Duncan Sutherland, 15 years of age, is a young pianist; he too has been part of the pre-tertiary program for several years and has held scholarships at the Canberra School of Music. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from taking part in the competition in St Petersburg, which begins on 23 March, there will be master classes, which these three students will be able to attend, with prominent Russian musicians. A concert has been organised in one of the famous concert halls in St Petersburg, under the banner of `Young Australian Musicians for the first time in Russia'. Judith Hurst, with her mother, has already left Canberra; I believe that the others leave on 15 March for the competition which begins on 23 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all senators would join with me in wishing these young people well. They are obviously talented. But, in addition to that, you do not get to these sorts of international competitions without an enormous amount of dedication and commitment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening I had cause to rise in the adjournment debate because of interest in a media statement that I issued on 2 March. I had that statement incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some further developments on parts of that statement during today, none the least of which was a story that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on page 2, entitled `Senator whips up migration paranoia'. There has also been a statement, I understand, that Senator O'Chee made in the taking note of answers after question time today. I did not hear Senator O'Chee. I was not advised before he spoke that he would be speaking or that he would be mentioning me in his speech. I was in the chamber until close on 3.30 p.m. and he spoke, as I understand it, around about 3.35 p.m. or 3.40 p.m. At that time I was doing a media interview with a radio station in Adelaide, so I did not hear what he had to say&mdash;not that I would have, in any case, cancelled the media interview to listen to Senator O'Chee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I rise tonight just to perhaps draw attention to the full contents of the press statement that I issued. Senator O'Chee, in the joint statement he issued with the Hon. Helen Sham-Ho, quoted part of a paragraph of the press statement that I issued on 2 March. That, in some way, distorts the complete message that I was putting forward in issuing the press statement. I will read into the record the full paragraph from which Senator O'Chee and the Hon. Helen Sham-Ho have quoted. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciate that interdiction would be a most serious step to take and should only be considered as a last resort, but the Government will have to consider it if the Bill is lost.</PARA>
<PARA>The part that was quoted in the media continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would anticipate that hundreds of thousands of people from China and some other Asian countries will shortly be making plans to get to Australia. They will hear, if they have not already heard, that the numbers are in the Senate to defeat the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>In not quoting the paragraph fully, somewhat of a distortion has been put on the words that I used. When you read the total press statement, it reinforces the view that I have that a distortion has occurred. I started the statement by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will have to consider implementing a policy of interdiction and turning boats around at sea if the Bill relating to China's One Child Policy is defeated. The Bill is currently before the Parliament . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have read those words into the record for the sake of the record. I understand what politics is about. I understand that, from time to time, distortions on statements will occur because it is part of the political game. I do get a bit offended, though, when I am almost accused of being a racist. I really would resent that and would go to great lengths to clear my name. That is the inference and implication in some of the media comments that have been made about my statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised, though, that Senator O'Chee went to the lengths that he did yesterday in attempting to whip up a bit of a storm about the content of the statement I issued a week ago. It is not as though the media had not noticed it a week ago. I recall the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> ran a story on it on Saturday, and both the Australian Associated Press and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> ran a story on it. It took until Wednesday of this week for any further attention to be drawn to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 July 1994 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and it was in other newspapers as well around the country; most certainly it was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>&mdash;there was a story headed `Boat people "threat" looms'. It was written by Norman Aisbett. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to 20,000 ethnic Vietnamese in the southern China city of Bei Hei will present Australia with a big boat people problem, according to Indo-China Refugee Association president Marion Le.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate that if my comments&mdash;the part comment that has been used&mdash;are seen in any way to be, in Senator O'Chee's words, `disgusting paranoia' those very same assertions could be directed at Ms Le and the Indo-China Refugee Association. I did not make those assertions at the time. Her words did cause me great fears at the time, but I never said&mdash;and I would not even now&mdash;that it was disgusting paranoia or even touching on racism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the comments that were quoted were the most important comments I put in the press statement. I sought to make a number of points in the press statement. Another one states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard must also act to neutralise the influence that the secretive National Civic Council has on his Party. The NCC influence has already caused his Party to make an embarrassing backdown on the Compensation Bill (Migration Amendment Bill No. 3 [1994]) which was passed this week in the House of Representatives, after it had been defeated in the Senate last year.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on further in the statement to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outrageous statements from NCC inspired asylum support groups that distort the aims and objectives of the Bill and Government policy, are further exaggerated and given credence in the media. This further compounds and confuses the signals being sent to Asia. People who want a better life will, in their thousands, maybe tens of thousands, make their way illegally to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that influence of the National Civic Council is of great concern, and has to be of great concern, to all of us in this parliament, not only to members of the Liberal Party. It is enormously strong. Sooner or later it will be fully exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important point I raised in the press statement was the matter of legal actions and the blocking, as I described it, of the court system by people who have failed to gain refugee status in the first instance because they have an army of lawyers prepared to give them free legal advice. I questioned the availability of free legal representation to illegals from the various legal aid commissions of Australia and I also asked how the legal aid commissions could justify expending very scarce resources on illegals when they continually complain that they have insufficient funds to meet the demands on these resources from Australians who are lawful and legal in the country. I ended my press statement by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stopping the illegals landing in the first instance would be one way of solving these problems, but this action should not even be considered&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: should not even be considered&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">until Mr Howard is given an opportunity to put things right in his own Party. If he puts Australia and the Australian taxpayer's interests before those of the illegal boat people, pledges support and passage of the Government's Bill, then the last ditch action of interdiction need not be considered.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude my remarks by commending the opposition and, indeed, Mr Howard&mdash;I do not do this very often&mdash;for the fact that the revised version of the bill, slightly amended, passed the House of Representatives no later than yesterday afternoon, probably around the same time as I was addressing my remarks in this chamber. I am very pleased on behalf of the taxpayers, particularly of my state of Western Australia, that this has happened. I will not try to score any political points from the fact that it is the second major backdown by the opposition parties on the question of migration legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too thank my colleagues, especially Senator Woodley and Senator Abetz, for allowing me to take precedence in this debate. I rise tonight to condemn the failure of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to properly discharge his duties as first law officer and as a member of parliament. The matter relates to the overturning by the full Family Court of a decision by a single judge on the basis of perceived bias. While the actions of the judge are central to the issue, I do not rise to consider the judge's behaviour or whether it should be considered by this parliament. My concern is the way the matter has been handled by the Attorney-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to distinguish between a finding of appearance of bias and actual bias. A finding of appearance of bias at law will overturn a decision on the basis that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done. The threshold for overturning a decision is therefore the appearance of bias. The question of whether actual bias was displayed need not be addressed. Confidence in the judicial system will be lost if there is a public perception of bias in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the particular matter there were four grounds of appeal. Three related to the property matter in dispute but the first ground alleged that the decision of the judge was unsafe and should be set aside as it raised a reasonable apprehension of bias. The appearance of bias was generated because the judge had a serious and close personal relationship with a solicitor who had acted for one of the parties and, while having passed it on to his junior, nonetheless kept a watching brief over the file and took the file back on or about the day after the matter was heard. The full court determined that both the judge and the relevant solicitor had a duty to disclose the relationship to the other party or, as an alternative, the judge should have declined to hear the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full court said that in its opinion the matter raised a question as to the integrity of the judicial process and had caused a miscarriage of justice. It upheld the appeal on the first ground and therefore did not hear evidence in relation to the remaining three. The Attorney was advised of the decision which made it clear that the integrity of the judicial process had been called into question. That is a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two questions which should have immediately occurred to the Attorney. The first question is: how serious a matter is this? Could the failure to disclose the relationship be considered misconduct in the constitutional sense? This should occur to the Attorney because, as he would well know, the constitution spells out the process by which any judge of the High Court and any other courts created by parliament can be removed. The constitution does not say that it is up to the Attorney to decide whether any conduct merits the removal of a judge, and it does not say that it is up to the chief justice of any particular court to decide that. It makes it very plain that the decision is one for parliament alone. So the first question the Attorney should have asked himself was not the egocentric, self-important question: am I satisfied that this conduct does not warrant removal? Rather, he should have asked himself: is this behaviour of such a nature that parliament could consider it to be misconduct in the constitutional sense?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second question is: has this happened only once, or are there more occasions involving this particular judge and this particular solicitor? The conduct concerned has caused considerable disquiet amongst family law practitioners, and that would undoubtedly be quite dramatically exacerbated if there had been more than one occasion. The Attorney, as first law officer of the Commonwealth, has a responsibility to protect the judiciary from unwarranted attacks and to do what he can to maintain the integrity of the judicial system. That responsibility is a heavy one. It should mean that, when a problem arises that has the potential to damage that integrity or the potential to invite attack, he should take whatever steps he properly can to defuse the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Attorney failed to consider either of these questions. He had a conversation with the Chief Justice of the Family Court and that was that. I have sought an opinion from Mr Tony Morris QC as to whether the conduct of the judge in question is capable of constituting proved misbehaviour according to the constitution. On the available evidence&mdash;bearing in mind that the judge has not presented her case&mdash;Mr Morris, in a very comprehensive and detailed opinion, is of the clear view that parliament could conclude that the conduct amounts to misbehaviour. The Attorney should have sought his own advice, which in all likelihood would have been in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An opinion that parliament could find proved misbehaviour of course does not mean that it should or would. I am making no comment in that respect at this time. But, if the Attorney wanted to do all that he could to maintain confidence in the judiciary and to protect the judiciary from damaging criticism, he should have contacted me, Senator Spindler, the Greens and Senator Harradine. He should have alerted us, as the legal spokespersons for those parties, as to what had happened. If we were all of the same view that he came to&mdash;namely, that this did not fit into the constitutional sense of misconduct&mdash;that would have been the end of the matter. If anyone was of a different view, the Attorney could have at least said that he had done all he could. Such action would have given knowledge and information to members of parliament to consider the exercise of their constitutional duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Attorney must have known and been able to foresee that members of the profession would be concerned and annoyed at what had happened and that, by just carelessly brushing the matter aside, he was running the risk that pressure would build up in the profession&mdash;which of course it has. The impression has been created that he and the Chief Justice think they can have a cosy little chat and decide for themselves whether a judge should be able to keep his or her job. The difficulty that I and others had in getting a copy of the judgment in no way helps dispel the rumour that there was intended to be some sort of cover-up. It all looks very second rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney in his own press release has displayed a devastating failure to understand the issues. The failure to grasp the issues is presumably what led him to make the mistakes. It is infinitely preferable that we judge him a fool rather than being left with the view that he is a knave. His first error was that he said the court concluded that there may have been an apprehension of bias. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth should be able to read and understand a judgment and should know that the court was categorical in its finding of perceived bias. We have to ask why the Attorney would seek to soften the finding of the court, why he would seek to distort the truth and pretend that the court had found there may have been an appearance of bias rather than stating the truth: namely, the court had found there actually was the appearance of bias and that the judge's failure to disqualify herself led to a miscarriage of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Attorney-General to attempt to dilute the clear finding of the full court is disappointing, to say the very least. In the second paragraph of his release, the Attorney-General went on to note that he had been assured by the Chief Justice of the Family Court that he was satisfied that no actual bias was displayed. The clear implication was that, if there was no actual bias, there was no problem. The implication that is sought to be drawn is quite misleading. It is clear that the judge's action in creating an appearance of bias could in itself amount to misconduct. Implying that the judge did nothing wrong is quite misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of actual bias was not before the appeal court. In his statement, the Attorney indicated that he was assured by the chief justice that there was no actual bias displayed. I do not question the necessity for and the desirability of the chief justice making inquiries about this matter and forming an opinion. The chief justice has very kindly outlined for me the inquiries he undertook, which included discussions with the judge in question and examination of material before the appeal judges. In doing so, he came to the view that there was no actual bias. But, since the appearance of bias is what undermines the judicial system, his conclusion in that sense is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the conclusion was reached after what must be termed a superficial inquiry, in which the relevant parties&mdash;particularly the appellant&mdash;did not have the opportunity to present their case or to test the evidence, it concerns me that the statement was relied on by the Attorney, was repeated by the Attorney in his press release and will therefore be relied upon by the public at large as a statement of fact. The truth is that the Attorney could not possibly know for himself. In any event, the question of actual bias misses the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final two paragraphs of the Attorney's statement offer nothing to support the integrity of this system. He invites me to make the same error he did: simply speak to the chief justice and accept without question whatever he tells me. He then goes on to say that the appeal process is the proper way to deal with any misbehaviour by a judge. Of course, it is not the proper way. The appeal process has simply confirmed the judge's error. It has put the parties back to square one at great cost. It has done nothing about the judge's mistake other than to recognise and confirm that it happened. The Attorney's response has been inadequate, to say the at least. I repeat: I give the Attorney the courtesy of judging him a fool rather than a knave. I thank my colleagues for letting me proceed ahead of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Abetz for letting me proceed. For some time last year, I tried to speak in a debate in the Senate on a report which I believed to be quite inadequate in its dealing with some aspects of the world arms trade. Foreign policy generally consists of either reaction to perceived threats or crisis management. During the Cold War, Australia followed the lead of the United States. It regarded the threat of the Soviet Union as paramount and reacted with the United States to crises where the Communist world seemed to be getting an advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of the Soviet Union mirrored the policy of the non-Communist states. The same lack of concern applied to the question of what would happen afterwards if the Cold War did not turn into a hot war. During this period, both sides armed themselves and their supporting states. Sometimes the results were both ludicrous and tragic. Ethiopia was a client state of the United States and Somalia was a client state of the Soviet Union. Later, Somalia became a client state of the United States and Ethiopia became a client state of the Soviet Union. The United States and the Soviet Union poured arms into both countries. The tragedy of that is not yet over. Both Ethiopia and Somalia produced food surpluses before they became involved in great power rivalry. Famines in both countries resulted from the massive overload of arms. At least, that was one of the causes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local conflicts prevented Ethiopia and Somalia from feeding themselves. The policies of both sides in the Cold War caused massive human suffering, which still continues in the Horn of Africa. It does not make economic sense. The combined profits of all the arms makers are probably much less than the cost to the rest of the world to help people who need help only because they were involved in the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Cold War has ended, we have had the Gulf War. Nations whose military potential would be quite low if they had to make their own weapons received arms from both superpower blocs. The Gulf War can be blamed in part for the massive flow of arms into the Middle East. The 10 biggest arms importers in the years immediately before the Gulf War were India, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Japan, Afghanistan, Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Czechoslovakia and North Korea. Note that four of the 10 biggest importers of arms were in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987-1991, Iraq had the third biggest volume of arms imports. Assume there was a generous profit margin of 50 per cent on the arms supplied. There is no accurate estimate of the cost of the Gulf War but $US200,000 million is a frequent estimate of property and environmental damage. This is a greater amount than the gross arms sales by the 10 top arms exporters in the five years before that war. That would mean that, for every $1 earned from arms sales to Iraq, $40 was spent on the war. Much of the profit from the arms sales went to the arms dealers. But the cost of the war was a burden on the taxpayers of the countries involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia supplied Iraq with training aircraft for the military. One would suspect that the cost of operating the three frigates Australia sent did not make up for that. Some of the money Iraq spent on arms was supplied by Kuwait, which wanted Iraq as a proxy to fight Iran. Kuwait lent Iraq money to buy weapons which were used later to invade Kuwait. The United States sold Iraq weapons and then participated in a destructive war to neutralise them. It did not make financial sense or any other kind of sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total sales of arms by the 10 leading exporters in the five years before the war were less in dollar terms than the cost of the Gulf War itself. The arms suppliers made a profit and the rest of the world paid. The long-term cost of arms sales can greatly outweigh the short-term financial benefits. Generally, human lives and suffering do not matter where there is money to be made, but the arms trade does not make sense, even in economic terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to the adjournment debate tonight is to hopefully have the last word in relation to the allegations made against me by the temporary member for Bass (Mrs Smith). At approximately this time two days ago, Mrs Smith grossly defamed me in the other place. She made outrageous allegations, which were completely and utterly untrue. Twenty-four hours ago, the temporary member for Bass had the decency to apologise for those comments. However, I believe two matters ought to be cleared up in relation to the apology, which is now shown in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> First of all, the member for Bass sought to lay the blame for the information provided to her by the parliamentary information service. I have undertaken inquiries in relation to my register of senators' interests. My changed circumstances were filed in July last year. Anybody can look through the register to obtain information if they firstly see the appropriate officer in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it is quite clear that the federal member for Bass got her research absolutely and devastatingly wrong, I believe it is highly inappropriate to seek to blame the parliamentary information service for her behaviour the previous day. In seeking to apologise, the member for Bass said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made a statement regarding his pecuniary interest in a legal firm in which he had been a part owner and that it may have been in contravention of parliamentary privilege . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It looks as though her capacity to research and read documents is appalling. If she had looked back at the speech she gave only 24 hours before, she would have realised that she gave me no benefit of the doubt. There was no comment that I may have breached&mdash;listen to the words of Mrs Smith which come straight from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Abetz . . . made a comment for which he received financial return.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no `maybe' about it. It was asserted as a bold fact. Of course, it was a blatant untruth. She then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Abetz has committed the worst of all political crimes . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There was no suggestion that I may have done so&mdash;just a bland statement that I had done so. She then kept on by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I really must say that this is the most appalling abuse of political position that I have encountered so far in my time here.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no `may'. There was no suggestion that I may have done that. She asserted all that as being absolute gospel, no ifs or buts. As history now records, everything that the federal member for Bass sought to impute to me was without foundation and was absolutely and utterly wrong. In fact, the evidence had been on the public record for in excess of seven or eight months for her to get it right. Then for her to give this lukewarm apology and try to rewrite the history of 24 hours before, I believe, compounds what she did to me, my family and my colleagues and associates in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this game of politics I do not mind mixing it and matching it with people about their political views or beliefs or arguing that they are wrong in relation to the way they think Australia ought to be run. When we start imputing, and if fact saying, that people are engaging in criminal conduct, one would hope and trust that the research is done very thoroughly and that the facts are got right. Even if it was done in good faith, there ought to be an absolute and unreserved apology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For her to try to blame the parliamentary information service when the information was available to her, I find to be appalling. To say that she had asserted that I may have contravened my parliamentary position and the trust that the people of Tasmanian had placed in me is, with respect, not reflective of what she had said only 24 hours before. She finished her speech last evening by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So I stand proudly in the House and offer Senator Abetz my apologies for what I said last night.</PARA>
<PARA>For her to say that she still stands proudly in the House despite the hurt and injury that she has occasioned to my name, my professional standing and my parliamentary standing is, I believe, an apology that is simply forced. She knew she got it wrong so she made a grudging apology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have seen the Prime Minister of this country make a similar</PARA>
<PARA>allegation against the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this alleged Packer-Howard deal on media ownership. If that were true&mdash;and of course it is not&mdash;the consequences, I would suggest, are very serious for this country. There was no shred of evidence produced, but the bucket job on the Leader of the Opposition by the Prime Minister continued unabated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then when the Leader of the Senate was asked by Senator Hill to put up or shut up on the claim, Senator Evans came out with a most distorted conglomeration of bits and pieces that did not even amount to circumstantial evidence. It did not even provide sufficient evidence to convict somebody of a parking ticket offence. It was absolutely outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Labor Party got caught out on that, what did it do? The Prime Minister</PARA>
<PARA>straightaway started to talk about the republic. It seems to me that there has come within the Labor Party a sense of desperation, a sense that it is going to lose the next election unless it can smear and besmirch members of the opposition and accuse them of conduct which clearly, if true, would have been unbecoming and highly inappropriate for a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the matter I was involved in, it was backbencher to backbencher. With the Prime Minister it was leader to leader. It appears as though the Labor Party is embarking upon a campaign of denigration, and I want to bring to the people of Australia tonight the very clear and distinct impression that I have that this is a deliberate campaign designed to denigrate the Liberal Party and the opposition, and to ensure that the public debate gets distracted from the real issues: the high interest rates, the overseas debt, the unemployment, the drought, the lack of road funding in Western Australia&mdash;all those other issues that are in fact the real issues. I look forward to getting back to the debate on the real issues that this country faces. </PARA>
