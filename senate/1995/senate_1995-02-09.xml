<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRAWN BOAT LEVY BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary representing the Minister for Resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move that this bill now be read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to provide the legislative framework for collecting a prawn boat levy from boats that catch prawns for the export market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this bill, as in the Prawn Export Charge Bill, the government has taken account of the `user pays' principle by targeting only that sector of the prawn fishing industry that catches prawns for export markets. Boats that would normally take prawns only for the domestic market are exempt from the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy will be payable by the owner of any boat that is licensed to be used to take prawns and is a registered establishment under the Export Control Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of levy is to be set by regulation, being initially between $50 and $500 per boat per annum, depending on the length of the boat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are four categories of boat length levies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)A boat less than 10M will attract $50;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)A boat 10 but less than 15m will attract $100;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)A boat 15 but less than 18m will attract $200; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)A boat over 18M will attract $500.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation provides for a maximum levy rate 50 per cent higher than each of the rates set out above. Pro rata rates of levy will be prescribed in the first year of operation of the act if the act comes into effect part way through a financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the boat levy will raise some $300,000 during the first full year of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that levy rates for boat length can only be raised following an APPA annual general meeting at which approval is given by members agreeing to new rates of levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRAWN EXPORT CHARGE BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move that this bill now be read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to provide the legislative framework for collecting a charge on the export of sea caught prawns, parts of sea caught prawns and the sea-caught prawn component of a product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes that all sea-caught prawns, parts of sea caught prawns and the sea caught prawn component of a product, which are exported from Australia be subject to a charge for the funding of the export promotion program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charge will be paid by the exporter and will be initially set at 2 cents per kilogram. Only by Industry's recommendation can the rate of the charge be raised by regulation to a maximum of 10 cents per kilogram.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This levy is expected to raise some $200 000 for promotion in the first full year of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that levy rates for the export charge can only be raised following an APPA Annual General Meeting at which approval is given by members agreeing to new rates of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRAWN EXPORT PROMOTION BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second reading speech by the Parliamentary secretary representing the Minister for resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move that this bill now be read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purposes of this bill is to provide the administrative framework for collecting, managing and disbursing the prawn promotion funds. This is one of three bills which, collectively, provide funding for the export promotion of Australian sea-caught prawns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prawn sector is an important part of the Australian fishing industry, providing significant input to a number of regional economies. In 1992-93 prawn exports totalled $260 million which is nearly 20 per cent of the total Australian fishing industry GVP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some 10,000 tonnes of sea-caught prawns are exported annually. Over the past few years, market share and earnings have been reduced through direct competition in overseas markets, mainly from aquaculture prawns being produced in Asian countries. Prices have fluctuated dramatically over the last six years and this has affected all sectors of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All major Australian prawn fisheries are being fished to full capacity and are being carefully managed by state and Commonwealth authorities to ensure sustainability for the industry. Increased catches to counteract falling prices are just not possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Faced with these pressures, the prawn fishing industry recognised the benefits of developing a structured and coordinated approach to market development. Through the Australian Prawn Promotion Association (APPA), the industry is working to increase the export value of Australian sea-caught prawns, especially those sold in the Japanese market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry developed a promotional strategy to contrast Australian sea-caught prawns with the Asian farmed product. The strategy aims to make the public aware of the excellent quality of Australian sea-caught prawns, taken from clean, unpolluted seas. It will also stress specific attributes such as size, flavour and health status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a great example of an industry working together to best promote its product in a very competitive market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The promotion plan will be complemented with action in other important areas such as value adding, product quality, freight cost minimisation and reliability of supply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following development of the proposal over several years, the vast majority of the Australian prawn industry has called for a compulsory levy on its members to promote its products in export markets, particularly in Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APPA had tried introducing voluntary levies but these did not work due to a large number of free riders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government support in collecting levy is not unique to the prawn industry. Within the primary industries and energy portfolio, some 30 compulsory levies or charges are collected by the government to fund promotion and other activities to assist primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compulsory levies will allow for greater accountability over the use of funds and ensure that those gaining the greatest benefit from the promotion will make the largest contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the very strong industry support for the promotion scheme and its funding through a levy, the government was pleased to agree to industry's request to introduce legislation for compulsory levy. The prawn boat levy and the prawn export charge are the two mechanisms by which contributions will be collected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To support APPA in the responsible management of public funds, the Commonwealth's Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) will oversight the management and disbursement of the funds collected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APPA will bear the responsibility for determining the promotional activities and the day to day running of the scheme. APPA will also provide FRDC with strategic, annual operational plans and annual reports about prawn promotion. These will form a segment of any FRDC reporting requirement to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is pleased to allow APPA to be the main player in running the promotion program. The government views this as an important industry initiative and considers it will prove an important example to other sectors of the fishing industry wanting to promote their products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prawn export promotion bill will provide the administrative framework for collecting, managing and disbursing the prawn promotion funds. The collection arrangements closely mirror those that appear in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (PILCC) Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new bill adapts the essential features of the PILCC Act 1991 for the collection of both the prawn export charge and the prawn boat levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the provisions in this bill will give the secretary of the department the power to conclude an agency agreement with APPA, making it the collecting organisation for the boat levy and the export charge, thus reducing administrative costs on the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up its allocated subscription to the fourth general capital increase of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This means Australia would subscribe to 102,370 shares, of which only 2,047 shares will be paid-in at a cost of $US24.69 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be aware that the bank, which was established in 1966, is a major multilateral development finance institution engaged in promoting social and economic advancement in the Asia-Pacific region. Major borrowers include the People's Republic of China, Indonesia and India.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has 55 member countries from within and outside the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bank's capital is of two kinds: paid-in and callable. The capital increase involves actual payment by members of the paid-in component, and a potential liability for the callable component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The callable component of the bank's capital serves as collateral against which the bank borrows funds for onlending. The bank's loans have been financed largely by funds borrowed from international financial markets. A call on the callable capital of the bank has never been made. The bank's prudent financial policies and healthy level of reserves make it unlikely that such a call will ever be made in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the bank's articles of agreement the maximum amount of funds the bank can lend can not exceed the total amount of its unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves and surplus. In March 1994 the bank reached its lending limit and stopped making new loan commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1994, the ADB Board of Governors approved a resolution authorising a general capital increase which doubles the share allocation from 1,720,497 shares to 3,440,994 shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will allow the bank to expand its borrowings and so finance the bank's operations to beyond the year 2000 and allow the bank to pursue its development objectives in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the general capital increase, Australia is entitled to subscribe to an additional 102,370 shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only 2 per cent of these shares need to be paid-in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the low paid-in component, the annual cost of the subscription accounts for a very small part of Australia's aid budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In supporting the bank, Australia recognises the significant contribution it has made to developing countries in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In pursuing its original prime objective of economic growth and poverty alleviation the bank has also emphasised private sector development, public sector efficiency, human resource development and natural resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recently, at the urging of Australia and other donor countries, the bank is paying greater attention to environmental and social problems. In fact, the agreement of several donor countries to adopt the resolution for an additional share allocation was conditional upon the adoption of a policy statement to guide the bank's operations in the 1990's.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This statement emphasises initiatives to strengthen the planning process in the bank, incorporating cross-cutting concerns such as poverty, population, women in development, social sector investment and the environment and addressing new policy issues such as good governance, disclosure of information and the establishment of an inspection function to review potential non-compliance of bank policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of these initiatives have either been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bank has now established a 50/50 mix between traditional projects which emphasised economic growth and those projects which are aimed at poverty reduction, human resource development, women in development and environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main way in which the bank assists its developing country members is by providing loans for economic and social infrastructure development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1966 and 1993, the bank provided its member countries with loans totalling $US32.8 billion from its ordinary capital resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bank's lending is primarily to the public sector. However, some direct and indirect funding of the private sector has also been undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bank's lending activities have focussed on projects in the agriculture, energy, finance, transport and communications and the social infrastructure sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to its financing activities, the bank plays an important role in providing advice on economic policies, sector restructuring and institutional development in developing member countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Policy reform measures relating to macroeconomic policies, sector programs and projects are usually associated with the bank's lending activities and are aimed at improving economic growth prospects, ameliorating poverty and addressing social inequities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic policies promoted by the bank are outward-looking and consistent with the development of open international trade and financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through its lending and technical assistance activities, the bank supports the strengthening of institutions which are essential for economic and social advancement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's participation in the bank allows us to pursue our economic, political and humanitarian interests in collaboration with other donor and developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bank's activities have complemented Australia's bilateral aid program in a number of countries, most particularly in Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific island countries and Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participation in the Asian Development Bank has also allowed us to widen the focus of our aid at a relatively low administrative cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian membership of the bank entitles Australian suppliers of goods and services to bid for work generated under bank-financed activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past five years, loan disbursements by the bank have averaged $US2.6 billion per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provides a sizeable commercial opportunity for Australian firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant benefit to Australia from the bank's activities, however, is not direct procurement from bank projects but the wider export opportunities for Australian businesses deriving from economic growth promoted by the bank in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian exports to the developing member countries of the bank increased from $12.7 billion in 1988/89 to $23 billion in 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a proportion of total Australian exports, exports to those countries rose from 29 per cent to 38 per cent during this five year period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is enormous potential for further exports as economic growth in the region continues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a founding member of the ADB and a strong supporter of it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, Australia has not been uncritical of the bank where criticism has been justified and it has been pressing the bank to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to concerns expressed by Australia and other countries about the quality of bank loans, in 1993 the bank established a taskforce to provide recommendations for improving project quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the report of the taskforce in early 1994, the bank has taken measures to improve the quality of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As recommended by the taskforce, the bank is currently reviewing its organisational structure to make it more relevant to its strategic objectives and to improve the quality of its projects through improved coordination of its project and program work, greater attention to project implementation vis-a-vis project approvals, strengthening of project executing agencies in the borrowing countries, and improved accountability for the quality of projects within the ADB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the economic and political significance of the Asia-Pacific region to Australia and the important developmental role which the Asian Development Bank is playing in the region amply justify Australia's continuing support of the bank by taking up the 102,370 shares of the bank's general capital increase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the associated explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 has come on this morning somewhat before its time. I understand that if we had followed the normal procedures of this place we would have been dealing with this bill at around half past 10 or a quarter to 11. One of the difficulties with this bill, as I have mentioned before, is that it has come before this parliament in a great rush. There has not been a proper opportunity for many members of the public to have regard to its implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was dealing with this matter yesterday the debate was interrupted at a quarter to one. I was indicating that we need to take a stand in the interests of both the public and the individuals who may have a well founded fear of persecution if they return to China. I had indicated certain things about making China a safe third country. I had also indicated that we have to do this despite some ignorance in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ignorance, unfortunately, is a well-meaning ignorance. It is based, again unfortunately, on some highly coloured misinformation and indeed comes from an ill-founded fear, as distinct from the well-founded fear of some refugees, that is engendered about a wave of yellow peril. This clearly is occurring in the community, and it causes me a great deal of concern. I have heard it, and other honourable senators would have heard it. It is most important that the government or anybody else not do or say anything that might inflame that ill-founded fear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to the points of the bills in the very short time I have left. Evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee public hearing on the bill pointed to a major flaw in the scheme of subdivision AI of division 3 of part 2 of the Migration Act. That division provides for the making of regulations which prescribe a certain country as a safe third country for a prescribed class of persons. The subdivision further precludes any person affected by such a regulation from lodging an application for a protection visa. The major flaw is that that scheme does not provide adequate protection for an individual who may have a well-founded fear of persecution in relation to the so-called safe third country. This was emphasised by Mr Matthew Zagor of Amnesty International Australia when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amnesty is unaware of the safe third country definition being applied to the very country where the alleged violations which are the grounds for a claim are occurring . . . This is a misuse of our legislation and it refuses to recognise legitimate concerns about the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China. The use of the safe third country legislation will exclude an entire group of people from making claims on any grounds. In other words, if you are a Vietnamese refugee who has settled in China, no matter what may have happened to you in China, you will be sent back . . . The government is deciding and implementing that decision in law that no Vietnamese are facing persecution of any kind whatsoever in the People's Republic of China.</PARA>
<PARA>We have to listen to these people who are concerned about human rights, which we all are of course. This flaw became very evident in the case of statutory rule No. 3 in the corresponding bill which names the People's Republic of China as a safe third country for Vietnamese nationals being settled. No witness before the committee was willing to deny the possibility that an individual Vietnamese national may well face persecution from the PRC authorities perhaps for his or her religious beliefs or political opinions. Again, no witness denied that the PRC has an appalling human rights record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also would deny proper refugee process to certain prescribed persons who are Chinese nationals and may never have previously left China but who may have a well-founded fear of persecution for convention reasons. This refers of course to the close relatives of the Vietnamese nationals. The only remedy provided in subdivision AI is for the minister to exercise his discretion in the public interest. I have dealt with the question of what `in the public interest' means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, this was referred to in the evidence of Jean-Pierre Fonteyne, senior lecturer of the graduate international law program at ANU. Dr Fonteyne said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ministerial discretion is&mdash;we are told&mdash;not enforceable, not compellable, but more importantly in any case it is specified in the proposed legislation as one that is to be exercised in the `public interest'. Of whom? Of Australia. Not in the interest of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is doubtful on the evidence that the PRC ought to be regarded as a safe third country. This concept properly does not apply when claims of persecutions are made in relation to the country of origin. In the case of former Vietnamese nationals settled in the PRC that have lodged claims in Australia for refugee status, their claims of persecution have been against PRC authorities, not the Vietnamese authorities. They are coming from China, not Vietnam. Let me say this: a number of these people have already been granted refugee status. They have already been granted protection visas. Surely, you are not saying that these people have had some power slip through the net. There must have been the procedures that have been adopted. They must have been found to have had a well-founded fear of persecution, not from Vietnam but from the country that they came from; that is, the PRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is retrospective in effect. It will invalidate the applications of several persons from the PRC which have already been lodged and are being processed. The bill also provides for the retrospective application of any regulations made in regard to other safe third countries. The bill allows for applications lodged as long as six months before the passing of a regulation to be invalidated. All that is needed is for the minister to gazette a notice that he intends to make such a regulation. This will allow the minister effectively to freeze refugee applications from certain groups while an agreement to return them to a safe third country without processing of their refugee claim is sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is discriminatory against Vietnamese nationals. The bill deals with fundamental matters of human rights.

People are concerned, but I echo the comments Senator Harradine just made that there are some in our society who are taking that concern to extremes and expressing extreme views about the arrival of people. I read in the generally distributed newspapers throughout this country suggestions from people that, instead of allowing these people to land and giving them the right to make application for refugee status in Australia, we should be sending out the navy boats and blowing these boats out of the water at the cost of the human lives that are on board. That is certainly not a position Australia should be following, nor do I believe that Australia should be apprehending these boat people as soon as they enter territorial waters and turning them around, as some other western developed countries have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a lucky and relatively wealthy country, and we can afford to give succour to some who are less fortunate than others. In giving that succour we have to control it. We are very proud of our record of settling some 13,000 people who will be settled here under the refugee and humanitarian category during this financial year. On a per capita basis, that is as much as any other refugee settlement country is doing. We do not need the additional pressures of individuals or groups of individuals, from wherever they come in the world, making the decision that they themselves will settle in Australia without going through our proper processes. Indeed, part of the concerns raised in the community is that these people who arrive unauthorised by boat in Australia are seen to be jumping the queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This piece of legislation is already misunderstood in the community. Part of the reason why it is misunderstood is that some of the people who have already spoken in this place do not seem to understand the impact of the bill. It has been said that we are making a general comment about human rights in China. Indeed, the bill is doing absolutely nothing of the sort. It is not making a general comment about human rights in China. It is dealing with a specific group of people who have received and enjoyed the sanctuary of the People's Republic of China for many years at great cost to the Chinese taxpayers and who have unilaterally decided that they no longer need that protection and are wanting to resettle in Australia. The bill relates only to the specific group of people in respect of whom all objective evidence supports the claim that they have enjoyed protection previously in China. It makes no judgment whatsoever about China's general human rights record. The issues are quite separate; they are not contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further argument has been put in this chamber and outside that the Sino-Vietnamese people are fleeing China and therefore China is not a safe third country. That is a nonsense. You could draw analogies to prove how nonsensical the argument is. For example, take a person who has fled from my former homeland of Ireland, has settled in New Zealand, then fled to Australia and is now saying that they have been persecuted in New Zealand and making a claim against New Zealand. It is a nonsense argument. Analogies can be drawn to prove just how nonsensical the argument is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of the safe third country agreement that Australia has entered into with China in relation to this specific group of people is based on the objective evidence that supports the argument that the people have received previous protection. In this case, the evidence of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees is overwhelming and it was overwhelming during Mr Pierre-Michel Fontaine's presentation to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. What Mr Fontaine is putting forward is accepted in other areas of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In November last year parliament passed a bill relating to the Vietnamese people who had fled Galang Island in Indonesia, came to Australia and attempted to claim refugee status here. They had previously applied for refugee status and had been refused and they were refused during review&mdash;they were not going to be allowed to apply for refugee status in Australia. Consequently, when the legislation was passed some of the people who had arrived here were sent back to Galang Island, it being a safe third country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 January this year, I went to Galang Island to find out what the situation was for myself in relation to those people. I was overjoyed to find that of the 102 people that Australia had sent back to Galang Island some 20 of the individuals concerned had taken the big decision for themselves to voluntarily return to Vietnam to start building their lives back in their home country and to stop languishing in a detention centre in Indonesia. But the news was even better than that. There were 60 others who had made application to be interviewed by the Vietnamese authorities with a view to their voluntary return to Vietnam. So out of the 102 people we had sent back, 80 people had made the decision to go back to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think our decision to return those people to Galang Island certainly sent a strong message to the community in detention on Galang Island. So much so that the authorities over there are overwhelmed with applications for people to be interviewed to be assessed for voluntary return to Vietnam. The passage of this legislation in the parliament today will send a further message to peoples in our near region to show that Australia is not a soft touch for anybody who unilaterally determines to settle in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also want to make a couple of comments about refugees. Senator Abetz referred to refugees who were detained in Port Hedland. Unfortunately, his comment shows his ignorance of the situation more than anything else. I can assure the Senate and the community of Australia that at this moment there are no refugees detained at Port Hedland. There are a number of people who have made application for refugee status in this country and have failed and they have failed on review and have now chosen to remain in detention while they pursue court cases against those earlier decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some people in Port Hedland who are awaiting determination of applications for asylum in Australia. There are also some people there who at this moment have made application for refugee status in Australia. I think a view pervades in some sections of society that if individuals make application for refugee status they are automatically refugees. Of course that is not the case. It is not the case with boat people and it is certainly not the case in the general community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics relating to refugee applications throughout the whole of the system in Australia last year prove that point. There were some 8,293 applications for refugee status finalised at the primary stage. Part of that finalisation was the withdrawal, for one reason or another, of applications by 1,036 applicants. Of the remaining 7,257, 858 people, about 12 per cent, were granted refugee status and 6,399, or 88 per cent, were refused. Of the 2,268 review stage applications finalised in 1993-94, 586 were resolved before a decision was taken. Of the remaining 1,682, 242 applicants were granted refugee status and 1,440 applicants were refused refugee status. I think the figures are overwhelming and prove the point that refugee status is not automatic merely because a person makes an application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comment was also made that the minister and the department were ineffective in dealing with this problem, which had been flagged was on our horizon and was going to increase and become an even larger problem. The problem was not just in the making in 1994. We also had experiences back in 1991 and 1992 with people coming from the People's Republic of China by boat to Australia. The government at that time did react and did act. The Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs went to China to discuss the problem with Chinese authorities. They were effective discussions because during 1993 the first boat of unauthorised arrivals to land in Australia from China did not arrive until the back end of 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some rumours circulating in Australia in the middle of last year that 20,000 people from the Beihai region of China would seek to come to Australia by boat. Fortunately, the rumours could not be believed because of their source. The rumours so far have proved to be unfounded. That is not to say that we did not have some problems. Between 13 November 1994 and 18 January this year, some nine boats arrived from the People's Republic of China, carrying 760 people in total. That is a very large number by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a long way from the 20,000 that were rumoured to be coming early last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 needs to be looked at in context. It fits in with a group of bills which have been brought forward to deal with the problem of refugees, or people claiming to be refugees, coming to our shores from South-East Asia, mainly China. This particular bill reacts to the recent arrival of a group of people from the south of China, from an area called Beihai.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was on the Senate standing committee dealing with legal and constitutional affairs which investigated this bill and took evidence on it. The evidence the committee heard was that these people had fled that region and come to Australia seeking refugee status because their housing had been destroyed by local authorities. This problem has been around for a long time. It has been around since 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no credit to the government that we have had to deal with this matter in a piecemeal fashion. In fact, you have a series of bills which have been put forward over a period and which have dealt with these problems on an ad hoc basis. I endorse Senator Abetz's remarks that a long-term solution is what we should be looking at. We should not just look at a problem when it arises and then bring in another bill to fix it. That has really been the form to date of this government in relation to dealing with this problem. Nonetheless, the coalition has indicated its support for this bill, and I would put to the Senate that I do support it with some trepidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have two concerns in relation to this bill, and I will deal with them shortly. Suffice it to say that when this problem arose Australia participated with other countries in the region. We have the comprehensive plan of action, which was brought about with participation from the United Nations, that dealt with this problem of the boat people, as they are commonly known. In this instance, the bill designates China as a safe third country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This notion of a safe third country came about as a result of that comprehensive plan of action. What it sought to do was to stop forum shopping; that is, if a person flees from, say, Vietnam and goes to another country and applies for refugee status there and is refused, that person cannot then go on to Australia and have a second bite at the apple. That is really what it is all about because this safe third country principle stops forum shopping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some evidence given in relation to whether or not China should be a safe third country. Mr Fontaine, who is the regional representative for Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, stated that the UNHCR's official position has been to support the Australian government's negotiations with China and the way it deals with the problem of refugees and asylum seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fontaine stated that his staff went periodically to missions in China to monitor the implementation of projects which are financed by the United Nations there. There was not any evidence given by Mr Fontaine which would indicate that China should not be a safe third country. However, there are some misgivings, of course, about China's human rights record. I do not view this as an endorsement of some of the actions of the Chinese government in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more pressing points really are to do with the minister's discretion. What this bill says is that, if you are a Vietnamese national and you flee from Vietnam to China, you cannot then just come to Australia and expect to be accepted automatically as a refugee. You have had your chance in China. China is a safe third country, and there is evidence to suggest that Vietnamese nationals have been looked after in China. There certainly was not any evidence before the Senate committee to indicate to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as the person arrives in China, the presumption is against them achieving the status of a refugee. However, there is a discretion with the minister to overturn that in the public interest, where it can be shown. I believe that discretion is important because it allows for there to be exceptions to the rule. Not every person&mdash;say, a Vietnamese national who comes in a group of people from China&mdash;will necessarily have the same circumstances; there will be some genuine refugees in that group of people. They must be looked after, and Australia has a very good record for looking after refugees. But, really, we must sort out the genuine refugees from those who really do not fit the bill, and this discretion allows the minister to make an exception to the rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem I have with this, however, is that the discretion is a non-compellable discretion; that is, you cannot force the minister to exercise his discretion. The second problem is that the person arriving in the country does not really have the means to access that discretion. It is not clear in the bill. The Senate committee raised this point in its report, as certainly did the Scrutiny of Bills Committee: it is no use offering some avenue of action, some remedy to someone but not telling them about it; what you have here is the propensity for a refugee to arrive in Australia and not know that there is this avenue of action available to him or her. I call upon the minister to clarify the exercise of this discretion as to how it can be accessed by someone arriving on our shores. I think that is an important aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect which was of some concern was the retrospective effect of the bill&mdash;and, again, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee did raise this point. Firstly, the legislation is backdated to 30 December, when the minister issued a press release on this matter. Here we have what is popularly known as `legislation by press release'; that is, the minister issues a press release and you subsequently have legislation introduced which is backdated to the date of the press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a principle I oppose that. However, in this case the legislation was introduced hard on the heels of the press release. So, if one were to look upon it on a scale of offending the principle, it would be at the low end of the scale. Nonetheless, I make the point now&mdash;and I intend to make it every time it arises in the future: legislation by press release is not a desirable principle. But, in this case, it is at the low end on the scale of offending. I think really that is not so much the issue as the other aspect of retrospectivity, where the minister in the future can gazette a country as a third safe country but the regulation does not have to be made for another six months. That regulation has to be made within a period of six months of the gazettal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nub of this problem is this: you have full force and effect at the date of the gazettal but no review by parliament. That is, you have a lacuna, a vacuum, if you like, for up to six months before the regulation is made. So the minister says, `That's a safe third country'&mdash;say, Indonesia is a safe third country&mdash;it is gazetted, but the regulation does not come in for a period of up to six months after that. That means for that period there is no review by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be that a minister makes a controversial decision and says that a country with a bad human rights record is a safe third country. Clearly, the people of Australia would reject that&mdash;and so, hopefully, would this chamber. But, of course, the review of that regulation would not take place for up to six months after the gazettal of the determination of a safe third country. That is a point I would make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really did not see the need for that to happen, and I do not see how pressing the need is for that to be in the legislation. I believe that it robs the Senate of the opportunity to review that regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is terribly important, when regulations are made, that they be reviewed by the parliament. Regulations govern, more so than the legislation pursuant to which they are made, the lives of Australians in a very direct manner. Government&mdash;without debate, without having legislation aired in public and without having the scrutiny of the press or this chamber&mdash;can bring in some rather sweeping measures by regulation. That is why we have the disallowance aspect of regulations, whereby this Senate can disallow a regulation and give it the scrutiny it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to place those concerns on record. I really do have some mixed feelings about this bill. I think those two aspects need to be looked at; they cause me concern. I will be watching closely the implementation of this bill, because there are aspects of it which could go off the rails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, we have a very difficult problem before us; we have to balance Australia's interests with the interests of those people who seek to gain asylum in this country. We have to balance human rights with pragmatism, and that is always the most difficult of tasks. It is as difficult as trying to estimate how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. That is the problem we have. That is the task this chamber has; that is the task we as legislators have before us, and we cannot shirk it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this bill is addressing a problem which should have been addressed years ago. It has been around since 1978. I believe that it would have been much more desirable to have approached this whole issue of refugees and boat people with one compendious piece of legislation, not piecemeal with the different bills that we have had. We have the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) to come. I must say that I have greater concerns with that bill than this bill. Nonetheless, the coalition supports this bill and, despite the concerns that I have about it, I join in that support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Ellison, I have some concerns about the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. But we in the coalition have taken the view that, for the good administration of Australia's migration laws, there is a need to send a clear signal to stop people coming willy-nilly to these shores and gaining access to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point to make is that every person who comes to Australia places an administrative burden on the Commonwealth. When people do not have a right to stay in this country, they place an unfair and undue administrative burden on the Commonwealth. They also hold up applications from people who do have a right to come to this nation. There is a major issue here of principle, and I think we have to look at the matter&mdash;not just now, but in the future&mdash;to closely monitor what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I declare a personal interest in this. My family ultimately ended up in this country as a result of the civil war in China. For all intents and purposes, we were refugees at that time. My family has not necessarily received the best treatment in the past from the authorities in what is now the People's Republic of China. But that is the past. I do not intend to go into it, and I do not think it is terribly helpful for today's debate to dwell on it, nor do I think it is terribly helpful for the future to dwell on issues like that. But they are issues of principle that must be borne in mind. In light of those experiences, I am always concerned to ensure that people who come to these shores and have a proper ground to claim to be refugees are dealt with fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are lot of people in the People's Republic of China who may well feel that they have a good case. We have to judge that for ourselves. This country's migration laws must be written by Australians for the benefit of Australia. That does not mean, in any way, that we in this country should turn our backs on the pleas and cases of genuine refugees because that is part of Australia's humanitarian commitment to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know many people who have come to Australia on boats who have been admitted to this country as refugees and who are now very proud Australian citizens. Senator Short knows, as I do, many people in Brisbane who have made massive contributions to this country. One gentleman, whom I shall not name, is now one of the biggest builders in Brisbane. He came to this country as a boat person and was given refugee status. He worked incredibly hard at two jobs to make enough money to go into business for himself. He became a registered builder and is now a very successful builder employing a lot of other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should always remember too, when we deal with refugee issues, the contribution that those people have to make. Many of them are incredibly motivated. They know that they have nowhere else to go and that this is the country to which they are making a commitment. That commitment is sometimes superb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share Senator Ellison's concern about the ability of refugee claimants to access ministerial discretion. I think that is something that needs to be closely looked at. Anything the government or the department can do to make clear how that would work would be gratefully appreciated. Since the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) is in the chamber, I ask him to bear that in mind because it was one of the concerns expressed at the committees hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not opposing this bill. I am not opposing this bill. I support the coalition's position 100 per cent, but I think it is important that we bear in mind that there are a number of views about this in the Australian community. I represent the view of a large number of people who are of ethnic Chinese or Vietnamese origin who are concerned to see the fair and proper treatment of refugees. We are giving the government the benefit of the doubt. We are trusting it on this issue, but I am sure it will be closely monitored. I know Senator McKiernan has strong views in the other direction and I respect his views. I bring to the attention of the chamber that there is a plurality of views on the whole issue and it is a hallmark of a mature, democratic society that all of those views are taken into consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the spirit of Senator O'Chee's contribution, I will make a couple of points about the position I come from. It is not just people from Asia who actually come by boat in refugee circumstances. I do not have to go back all that far in my family history to recognise that my grandparents came here as refugees from Greece through the Middle East with British passports. Some 80 years ago Australia was very keen to establish itself as a country which accepted refugees and would accommodate them when they arrived. I too, Senator O'Chee, come to this particular debate knowing that I would not have been here if Australia's doors were not open and the refugee processes were not available to my grandparents 70 or 80 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also come to this debate knowing that this is a particular problem facing all western democracies. It is not an easy one. It is not an easy one not only because of the humanitarian problem facing the world but also because of the processes necessary to be able to distinguish between those who warrant and necessitate assistance and those who do not. I think all sides of the chamber start from the same starting point that we need to have internationally accepted criteria on which to make assessments of who is and who is not a refugee. You also need to have processes to ensure that those criteria operate fairly as well as processes to ensure the quick return of those who do not necessitate support. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a difficult problem for all countries, and which countries spend billions of dollars on. The OECD countries spend tens of billions of dollars on processing and trying to work out who is and who is not a refugee. Australia has met its part of the overall international responsibility. Sometimes people complain about us spending too much on the processes, but an unavoidable aspect of having a migration program and a defensible refugee humanitarian program is having a process that identifies those who should and those who should not get assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We work internationally by meeting our obligations here. In this respect we have had advice on this legislation that it fits very squarely within our international obligations. We also work internationally with other countries&mdash;not just in our region but throughout the world&mdash;to set up mechanisms and regional processes to handle problems like this through the comprehensive plan of action, through regional consultations on illegal movements and through our very close cooperation with the UNHCR in Geneva and elsewhere to take refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people address this area they should acknowledge&mdash;and it is not something only one side of parliament should be proud of; it is something the whole parliament should be proud of&mdash;that Australia has a very strong record in taking numbers of refugees into this country. We take more refugees per capita than any other country in the world and we also give assistance. The letter from Margaret Piper acknowledges that assistance has been enhanced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination procedures have been made fairer and more rigorous and major advances have been made in the area of access to welfare and medical services.</PARA>
<PARA>So we should not decry our record or the fact that we approach this area in a non-racially discriminate way. I know there have been some suggestions of that. Angela Chan, someone I know very well from the New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council, said that this legislation had a hint of back to White Australia. Comments like that do not help the debate or public awareness of the situation. It is a comment that is sensationalist and born out of ignorance. You cannot say this legislation invokes white Australia at a time when we have a non-discriminatory immigration policy, when Vietnam is our fourth major source of migrants, when the government only a few weeks ago set up an office in the southern part of Vietnam to enhance people's access to the migration process here, and when we take into Australia at least 1,000 bona fide refugees of Vietnamese ethnicity and background who are in camps in the region. The government has announced that if we can take more, up to 1,300, we will be able to do so in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comment that we are returning to white Australia is ignorant and self-defeating and does no credit to the person who made it. I have said that to her direct and we have agreed to disagree on this. The public should be aware of the fact that the processes and intakes here all prove that the suggestion that we are returning to a White Australia policy is fallacious and ignoran</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be aware of comments like this. We also need to recognise in that context the great record Australia has had in this area. As I said earlier, we all need an internationally acceptable benchmark. Governments here have continually applied that benchmark for the last 50 years or so under the refugee convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to acknowledge that international jurisprudence moves on. Senator Ellison said, for instance, that this has been a problem since 1978. The solution we are tackling the problem with now was not around in 1978. This concept has only been around for the last couple of years. To that extent, only two years ago when I went to Europe I had an opportunity to scrutinise the safe third country concept and to discuss it with the UNHCR and others in both Geneva and elsewhere. It can be said that Australia has moved as quickly as is practically and desirably possible to introduce this concept into our legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comments have been made about the fact that we are introducing this legislation today with haste. This legislation does nothing more than extend legislation passed last year to another group of people and give retrospective effect to it. The process has now been through this parliament twice. The legislation in substance has been here before. For that reason, we think the Senate is well-equipped to make an assessment of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It allows for speed, which is necessary in these circumstances. Speed is something that the other side of the parliament has demanded of the process. It only allows for speed while giving flexibility, though acknowledging discretion. Speed is important, but we also need a safety valve. In terms of that safety valve, people who will be coming under this category will be interviewed and will have statements taken. Interpreters will be used. Those statements will go to the central office of the immigration department for further scrutiny and an objective, detached assessment of them. Any statement that in any way hints of refugee grounds will then be raised for consideration. That aspect of it is an important part of this issue. We are not in the business of sending anyone back to a situation of danger or persecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about has been acknowledged by both sides of the parliament. Those who normally invoke the UNHCR have chosen not to this time. We recognise that these people have been on the move for 16 years. An amount of $1 billion has been spent on their support in the southern part of China. Not only have our officers been going to the southern part of China; we have also received advice from the UNHCR about the conditions there. It is for that reason&mdash;I am sure that Senator Short would adopt this position&mdash;that we have been able to scrutinise closely what we are doing and accept that it is in the spirit of acceptable international obligations to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the opposition has not come to this position of supporting the government with open arms gleefully.

It has come to the only conclusion that is available to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, a lot of money has been spent, and we do have that advice. Some people have said that we have had a lot of notice about these people coming in and that we have known for a year or so. Let us go back to see how we would have known for a year or so. The only statement that one could pin that allegation to is a comment I made at the regional consultations on the illegal movements of people about April a year or so ago, where I warned that, unless we handle the problem properly, we will be triggering off mass movements of people. There was no warning or evidence of anybody moving from China. But it is fair to say that, unless we have processes for handling illegal movements of people, the trigger effect would operate very strongly. In fairness, if people go back to the debate, they will see what has now been termed the government being on notice for 12 months or so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that we have moved to the committee stage, I draw the attention of the Senate to the report that was on everybody's table this morning&mdash;a report from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. That report contains some of the answers that the minister provided to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee following the initial expressions of concern by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The areas that the committee draws the Senate's attention to are the ones that have been canvassed by Senator Harradine, Senator Chamarette and me during the second reading debate. The first one is the retrospective application of this particular legislation. The committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, the retrospective application of the proposed bill takes away the present rights of this class of asylum seekers under the current law of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The committee draws Senators' attention to the provision, as it may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of principle 1(a)(i) of the committee's terms of reference.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that is a message from a Senate committee on which both the coalition and the government are represented that should be taken notice of by the Senate. There are two other areas to which the bill draws attention, and I will come to them immediately. When this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> appeared on our desks this morning, showing that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, while noting the minister's responses, was still critical of a very substantial part of the bill, I approached Senator Short, the spokesman for the coalition, and suggested to him that, in view of these weighty criticisms of the bill by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the committee stage of this bill should be deferred. But Senator Short advised me that he was not disposed to do that. This should be on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scrutiny of bills committee has six members, and only one of those six members belongs to the Australian Democrats. The other members of the committee, who are respected senators of this chamber, include Senator Troeth, the chairman; Senator Michael Forshaw, the deputy chairman; Senator Mal Colston, whose work on the committee is well known; Senator Barney Cooney, the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee; and Senator Chris Ellison, the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. As I said, they are senators of considerable achievement and very good standing in this chamber. They belong to the two parties that are now rushing this bill through the chamber before we can discuss and evaluate this report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. That exposes the utter shabbiness of this process, and I refer to both the substance of the bill and the procedure that was used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chamber has been engaged in the final stage of this bill only to find on this very day the minister saying this morning that we should pass this bill forthwith because it needs to be taken to the House of Representatives today. Yet today we have received the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> asking senators to be aware of the weighty problems that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has found with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me continue with the other areas to which the bill has drawn attention. It draws attention to the minister's non-compellable discretion. We are told that is the safeguard for individual refugees that may have a case before we send a whole boat load&mdash;holus bolus&mdash;back to China. That is supposed to be the safeguard. But, as the committee points out quite correctly, this is a non-reviewable decision. First of all, it is a non-compellable task for the minister. He need not do it; he need not even consider it. But, if the minister chooses to consider it&mdash;somehow I do not know how we would know whether he should consider it, by osmosis I suppose&mdash;then his decision is not reviewable. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee says in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the committee thanked the Minister for this response&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The minister explained that it was an adequate safeguard&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but continued to draw Senators' attention to the provision, as it may be considered to make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent on non-reviewable decisions, in breach of principle 1(a)(iii) of the Committee's terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA>The third item that the scrutiny of bills committee draws to the Senate's attention is insufficient parliamentary scrutiny. It draws attention to the fact that the bill provides the minister with the power to draw up legislation in the future which will have a retrospective effect. There is a lapse of six months for the minister to make certain regulation by issuing a notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> in respect of a country that is now not a safe third country but declaring it as such. Senator Ellison has drawn attention to the fact that we are giving the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) the power to fix this nation with retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is one of the most critical committees of this chamber. It is one of the committees charged with a duty to watch over legislation and to ensure that legislation does not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. That is its first term of reference. Its third term of reference, which is relevant here, reports on whether legislation makes such rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon non-reviewable decisions. That is very important in view of this current issue of the minister's non-compellable discretion. Finally, its fifth term of reference relates to whether legislation insufficiently subjects the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One major issue which needs to be on the record is that the government, aided and abetted by the coalition, has today ignored the concerns which remain after the minister has provided an explanation to the committee. The government is prepared to ignore them and to push the bill through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to briefly advert to two other items and then ask the minister a question. As we detailed during the second reading debate, it is nonsensical to say that China can be a third safe country for refugees who are actually fleeing China. China is their country of habitual residence. One could almost say, after the number of years they have spent there, that it is their country of origin, although they originally fled from Vietnam, not China. The other aspect that relates to declaring China a third safe country is obviously China's appalling human rights record. Tiananmen Square is only one example of that. But we have the Australian government and the coalition&mdash;under its new leader, Mr John Howard&mdash;declaring China a safe third country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be made again is that we are dealing with refugees from Vietnam and China and this legislation is very specifically directed against these people. A number of witnesses before the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee have pointed out that this is clear discrimination against people from these countries, against Asian people. It is somewhat surprising&mdash;and it needs to be pointed out&mdash;that this discrimination is supported by the Liberal Party under the leadership of Mr John Howard, who only a few days ago offered an apology to those communities about earlier remarks which indicated a wish to discriminate against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that all these statements will not stop the juggernaut and that this bill, with the help of the coalition, will be passed today and belted through the lower house. But these things need to be put on the record. This is a day of shame for Australia when our parliament passes legislation of this type. The parliament and the nation will rue the day this bill is passed by the nation's parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the minister to address the question of the process that will be made available for that glorious safeguard that is being offered, which I would say is little more than a token gesture. Would the minister please outline what the procedure is for an asylum seeker who steps ashore from a boat or a plane, or swims ashore, and appears on Australian soil and is given a brief identification interview? How does that person know that the one hope he or she has got is the minister exercising a discretion? What legal assistance would be offered that person so that he or she can access that avenue of redress? What is the process? Who decides that that particular case should be brought to the minister's notice? I would appreciate some indication from the minister as to how this safeguard, which is not worth its name at the moment, could be made effective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) is aware, want a specific answer to this point that Senator Spindler has raised. I foreshadowed that in my speech in the second reading debate yesterday and I have told him on other occasions. I look forward to that answer with interest. But I do want to take issue with a couple of points that Senator Spindler has made in attacking me and the coalition for not supporting him in wishing to defer consideration at the committee stage because of the just receipt of the extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> No. 2 1995.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But much more significantly, and I must say I am surprised at how ill-informed Senator Spindler appears to be in terms of the processes and the information available in this parliament, everything that is contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> of yesterday, including the minister's response, has been available to Senator Spindler and to all of us in the Senate since 16 October 1994 when all of it was contained in the 17th report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.

The point I am making is that this document is on the desk of every senator in this chamber today, and it is important that senators in this chamber are informed of the minister's explanation and the fact that the committee, in a statement dated yesterday, 8 February, does not accept the minister's explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important for this chamber to have regard to the views&mdash;I acknowledge they are reasserted views&mdash;which are contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> No. 2 of 1995 that we have all received today. This <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> deals specifically with the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) that is before us. By reasserting quite firmly what it asserted in the 17th report of 16 November 1994, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee surely is asking us doubly to consider what we are bound to consider, I believe, as a Senate; that is, whether this legislation trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to delay the Senate in canvassing those matters. I know and Senator Spindler knows that, no matter what we say, this bill is going to go through this chamber today and it is going to be rammed through the House of Representatives, a bit like most of these pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, some members particularly&mdash;I hesitate to say it, but I dare say some senators&mdash;see the words `Migration Legislation</PARA>

The bland title&mdash;this also goes for the title of the next bill&mdash;of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill puts some people to sleep, yet within this particular bill lies a provision which may indeed condemn an individual to persecution for life on return to the PRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going to the specific point that was made by Senator Spindler and reinforced by Senator Short about the non-reviewable nature of the minister's discretion and about the minister's discretion itself, I think in this chamber we ought to know what procedures have been or will be put in place to ensure that the claims to refugee status of those who might slip through the net&mdash;I think that was the term being constantly raised in the committee&mdash;are brought to the attention of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the minister to what the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee said about this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look, Senator Spindler, what I am saying and what Senator Short is saying is that this bill basically invokes legislation that was passed in October. The substance of that legislation was assessed by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee in October. It is assessed here now. It does not suit your character or reputation in this place if you are playing politics on this matter, but let me suggest to you that that is precisely what you are doing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the process, let me also say, as I said in respect to the bill as a whole, that we do not come to this legislation lightly, nor do we come to it without taking enormous care to ensure that what we are doing takes into account our international obligations and protects us from sending anyone back who, in fact, would be in danger. To that extent, the process is important. I think the three senators who spoke mentioned the importance of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say that the process has been discussed in the committee hearings and officials were asked about what process is in place. I think the senators involved in this discussion do have some foreknowledge of the sorts of processes that we are talking about. The process that we are talking about is the establishment. In fact, there are careful mechanisms in place to ensure that any deserving case will be brought to my attention. As I said, this issue was explained during the committee hearing. The mechanisms are designed to ensure that any persons raising serious protection claims are not refouled as required by our international obligations under article 33 of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the process will be that all unauthorised arrivals are interviewed. They will be interviewed carefully by officers of my department and they will be asked for information about who they are, where they come from and why they have come to Australia. That is a broad definition of the three areas of questioning.

That mechanism is one that is, I think, the best available to government. It ensures that issues will be brought up, but it also ensures what is necessary and what everyone has demanded of the process. Everyone has demanded of the process that we have a quick process, particularly when you are talking about a safe third country provision such as this one. I think the government has allowed the only safeguard that is available to any administration in such an area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure, but the agreement and the legislation goes to those who are being protected in the People's Republic of China. Those who are being protected are Sino-Vietnamese and their families. That was very clear from the advice that came to the committee last week in respect of this. So, on that basis, the class of people whom we are talking about are those who have received protection. That is why we cover Sino-Vietnamese and families&mdash;and dependants, for instance, in families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, if someone is totally separate from one of those families, the legislation does not go that far because the advice that we have does not go to the protection that has been offered to them. They are a different class altogether. I think you can understand the distinction. You may raise it in terms of a bit of a curiosity in the legislation. But I think the reality is that you cannot take it much further than that core group, nor should you take it less than a core group, because if, for instance, you had a whole boatload of people who were married to PRC nationals the whole purpose of the legislation would be undermined. So in that context we have that non-compellable discretion. If questions of refugee concerns are raised, that process is there to accommodate that particular sort of situation&mdash;probably in particular. </PARA>

Now, for some reason, the government wants to change the rules to provide that if the student is still under the age of 22, even though the student is married, the student will no longer be treated as independent.

It is a decision that has upset a lot of students and student organisations around the country. I understand the government is seeking to develop some exotic argument that it is obliged to do this under the Sex Discrimination Act. Obviously, that is not so at all. It has no obligation. There is no obligation in the Sex Discrimination Act that obliges the government to change the definition of `independent' under the Austudy rule so that a student who is married and under the age of 22 is no longer to be treated as independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it is a convenient argument&mdash;perhaps it is the only argument that the government has got to mount. But it is certainly not so that in any way the Sex Discrimination Act applies to this decision. It might be relevant to other decisions that the government has to struggle with in relation to de facto couples and, if that is so, the government can have that struggle. But it is not relevant to this matter that is before the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, therefore, have moved the disallowance of this. We say, obviously, that a student who is married should continue to be treated as independent, whether they are under the age of 22 or over the age of 22. Their Austudy allowances should be treated that way as well. So it is a simple issue. It is an issue of commonsense in many ways. It is an issue of fairness to the students concerned. We are confident that the step we have taken to seek the disallowance of this motion is sensible and sound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the only other argument the government might have is that it is seeking to save a very small sum of revenue, but I do not know that that is an argument that the government has really put. What we are talking about is a very small sum of revenue. It will be interesting to hear the minister, but it will be hard to see on the figures we have been given how that could in any way be a convincing justification for what the government is seeking to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I trust that the Senate will seize the opportunity to bring this government to task again. I hope that in future when the government looks to discriminate against certain students, certain classes of students, it will take into account the fact that it will not easily get such discrimination through this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats welcome this move by Senator Hill. We believe that it expresses what should be so in this area: that, in fact, the government's attempt to bring about a very unfair interpretation is a move which is inexcusable and cannot be supported. We welcome the move for disallowance by Senator Hill, and we will be supporting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I find no capacity whatsoever to disagree with any of the words that Senator Hill has just used. He has presented the argument clearly. There is, I believe, no capacity to disagree with anything that he said. I would be amazed to hear any attempt that the government makes to bring any rationale to this debate in support of its attempts to bring an unfair regime to apply to young married students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the excuse that the government has indicated it will be using is, in fact, confirmed&mdash;that there is a belief that the Sex Discrimination Act has something to do with this and that there is an exemption which has expired&mdash;then I suggest that the simplest measure the government could adopt at this moment, without going any further in the argument, would be to continue that exemption, which apparently has been applied for 10 years. If the government's other legislation is clumsily unable to deliver a fair situation to all students, then perhaps the best way out is to continue the exemption, which has applied for some years now, and then seek another way which is fair to resolve the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who look for consistency in the law of the land and in the way society organises itself would recognise that society has established a number of measures of independence. In Australia the age of majority has moved from the traditional 21 years of age, which it was for an immeasurable time, down to 18. So there is at least some consistency with the ability to vote, to accrue debts, to enter contracts, to engage in military service, to enter into marriage and to make other decisions which are generally recognised as independent adult decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this government, until recently, chose for the purposes of Austudy to define `independence' as being 25 years of age. The Australian Democrats insisted that that was entirely unjust. With the assistance of student representative groups we have been able to persuade the government to at least reconsider that. Gradually, year by year, the age of independence with regard to Austudy calculations has been moved down from 25 years of age to what is presently 22 and should be 21. Of course, for consistency we would prefer eventually that it be lowered to 18 years of age. But we understand that the government cannot see, what I consider to be, the pure fairness of that. The exception has been that, if young people are married, they have defined their independence in another way&mdash;and I think in a quite correct way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a student the age of majority was 21; at that time it was also the age at which one could start to consume alcohol. Of course I obeyed that law, but I probably contravened another aspect of society: I think my mother bought by socks and underpants until I was about 30. That did not mean I was not independent; it just meant that that was the sort of parent I had. I never really liked any of those socks and underpants, and I do not know that I ever wore any of them. But that is the sort of thing that happens in families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here, one should adopt a degree of maturity and understand that, if you are independent, that does not mean to say you have to tick every little box, dissociate yourself completely from parental influence and be not at all dependent on parental advice. Even though I have neither of my parents with me on this planet now, I still think even at the age I am now that there are moments when I would very much like to seek my parents' advice on a number of matters&mdash;not the least of which are those things which happen in here. I do not agree with the idea that you should completely dissociate yourself from your parents before you can be declared independent. Just because the government decides that you are encumbered with, obligated to or dependent upon your parents does not make it so. We have to look at the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people are married, society accepts that they have established their independence. For the government to contradict this&mdash;what I think is&mdash;a perfectly legitimate definition of `independence' is sheer nonsense; it is bureaucracy gone to its worst extreme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the motion for disallowance, moved by Senator Hill, is about the Sex Discrimination Act, despite his attempts to denigrate that argument. In 1983, the Sex Discrimination Bill was carried through both houses&mdash;and I might point out that it was carried through with the support of Senator Hill and, I would assume, probably with the support of the Australian Democrats. In his debate on that bill, Senator Hill said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So rather than argue, as some have, that this Bill introduced a new type of legislation, I see it as a logical progression towards the goal of ensuring for all Australian women the right not to be discriminated against in certain specified areas critical to their well-being, on grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA>I think those sentiments are very worth while, and I am very pleased to see them set out. What I would like to emphasise is that it does include the basis of `marital status'. Certainly, Senator Hill is attempting to disallow at the moment a discrimination that exists in the Austudy regulations; that is, they discriminate between those who are married and those who are not married. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This breach of the Sex Discrimination Act has existed for 10 years. We have been seeking exemptions, and those have been provided. I suppose it reaches a stage where you can no longer make excuses and you have to change those regulations to comply with the Sex Discrimination Act. The Austudy regulations are discriminatory because, without those amending regulations that the opposition is attempting to disallow, they state that you receive independent status merely by becoming married; so someone who was in identical circumstances in terms of financial support, but unmarried, would not receive independent status. This, in my view, is discriminatory, and I am pleased that the regulations introduced this year have stopped that continuing discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to say, `Well, traditionally those who are married have been treated as being independent.' That is certainly the case. I suppose the reasons for that are largely based on inheritance; you became eligible to receive an inheritance upon either reaching the age of 21 or becoming married.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that most students, even though they may be married, are not financially independent. They do not have the capacity to financially support themselves, and this is not going to be automatically altered by the fact that they are married. Clearly, there should be one rule for students seeking financial support from the government, whether they are married or single. These regulations have that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting these original regulations, I am not  unsympathetic of those students who presently receive Austudy on the basis of independence brought about by their marriage who may be adversely affected. Figures indicate that approximately 0.5 per cent of the present Austudy population could potentially be affected by this change but, because of recent changes to the basis of independent status, this number will probably be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years, the age of independence has been reduced from 25, as it was when I went through university, to 22. As of 1 January next year, it is anticipated that that will be reduced to 21. That means that, no matter what your marital status is, you will receive Austudy as of the age of 21. In my view, that provides the maximum amount of financial support for those who require it and who would probably not be receiving it from their parents but, at the same time, it does not discriminate between those who are married and those who are single. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Senate not to support this disallowance motion. The effect of disallowing Austudy regulations 16 and 18 would be that they are almost certainly in breach of the Sexual Discrimination Act and would lead to students taking the matter up with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. This would lead to a large expense for the Commonwealth in defending a position which is in breach of nearly all the views expressed by senators who supported the original Sexual Discrimination Act. I urge you to not support this disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the most bizarre explanations I have heard in recent times. We are not dealing with the issue of sexual discrimination; we are dealing with the definition of independence. If the government's current position is that those people who are married get a poorer deal, then that is where the discrimination is occurring. It is not a matter of males or females being made worse off because they are married. It is a matter of the government proposing something that will discriminate against people because they are married. That is the change and that is what we are arguing against.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is trying to do with this amendment is take married people, under the age of 22, off the independent rate of Austudy. We support the coalition's motion of disallowance because it seeks to preserve the status quo and will retain the independent rate of Austudy for married people under the age of 22. The government's proposal was preposterous. Was the government honestly proposing to make adults over the age of 18 who are married seen under the eyes of Austudy laws as dependents and, therefore, means tested using their parents income and assets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a joke. I do not know a more obvious definition of independence than marriage and moving out of the parental home. If we were to extend the argument, is Senator Neal suggesting that if a young person is married and happens to be killed in an accident, then any goods owned by that person must go to the parents? For heaven's sake, that is ridiculous. There a lot of areas where the status of people change when they get married and leave home. Therefore, there is a recognition that that changes their financial circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the government pick the age of 22? Because at the age of 22 students naturally qualified for the independent Austudy rate, married or not. The government was trying to catch out students, who may get married for the $120 per week Austudy rate, before they would normally qualify for the independent rate. Instead of trying to catch people out who may be marrying for an extra government allowance, this should be taken as a message to the government to help those people who are desperate enough to study and have an income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to lower the Austudy age so any adults over the age of 18 can claim the independent rate if they are independent from their parents. The government should also think seriously about bringing Austudy into line with the dole and adding a rent assistance component so Austudy does not remain way below the poverty line. These are more helpful and constructive suggestions than the government's method of doing things. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion to disallow regulations 16 and 18 of the Austudy Regulations (Amendment). I do not often agree with our dark Green senators opposite, but on this occasion I must fully agree with the remarks Senator Margetts has just made. I am pleased to hear that the Greens and the Democrats are supporting us. Given the minor amount of money the government is saving here, one wonders what on earth this government is doing. The discrimination act was brought down in 1984 and it has taken this government 11 years to discover this problem. Why has it taken 11 years? Senator Hill has already put the arguments that the urgency for disallowing this pair of regulations is because they are patronising and extremely unfair. The effect is clear: it is to remove marriage as a ground for access by students to the independent rate of Austudy and Abstudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations are dated 6 December and will, therefore, adversely affect students about to commence their studies in late February. Young married students under the age of 22 will be severely disadvantaged if the regulations proposed by this ALP government are allowed to stand. This is yet another example of arrogant Labor Party government&mdash;not only arrogant but also inefficient, if it takes it 12 years to wake up to the fact that there is a problem. The government is breaking another longstanding promise to the Australian people, just as it has done in many other areas. If you look at the history of why governments go out of power, it is usually because of incompetence and because they keep upsetting a whole range of interest groups. The government is certainly doing this now with the students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to senior students recently. The minister is going to find when he gets to the next election that the sort of support he had in previous elections he is not going to get from the students this time, not after what he has done to them over the last few years. This is yet another silly example of an inefficient government, desperate for money, trying to squeeze out of the students a little extra money, totally alienating them just like it has alienated people in the timber industry, just like it has alienated the environmental lobby and just like it has alienated people who live under flight paths. Given all those interest groups the government has upset, the government will find that it will have a negative at the next election. It has just lost another 2,000 votes, the votes of married students under 22 years who are in line for a serve of this Labor government's arrogance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy is a Commonwealth funded financial assistance program. Students must satisfy an income and assets test. Broadly, for those who are not aware of the arrangements, there are three different scales. There is a standard rate for students between the ages of 16 and 22 who receive some financial and material support from their parents, there is an away from home rate for students who from necessity and because of other factors have to live away from their family home to study, and there is the independent rate of Austudy payment. This is the one that is being affected by these regulations. Up to now the independent rate was paid to students believed to be no longer financially dependent or supported by their parents; that is, a student with dependent children, one who has been working full-time or receiving a pension for three of the past four years and, up to now, a married student. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These regulations of the Labor government will remove marriage as a qualification for independence on Austudy and Abstudy rates. Coalition senators and members have received a raft of protest calls to their offices about this absolutely stupid measure. Young married students and their parents want the ALP generated anomaly that is now before us to be scrapped. Young married women and students are upset and confused by these arbitrary changes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Simon Crean, and DEET are supporting this ridiculous proposition. One would wonder why. The patronising assumption is that these young married people under 22 years of age remain financially dependent, supported by their parents. Unless the coalition and other parties in the Senate succeed in disallowing this motion, married students under 22 will have their Austudy payments judged not only on their own income and their spouse's income but on their parents' income and assets as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How out of touch is government thinking when the government proposes such a ridiculous change to regulations. In many cases, these married students have moved to other states or are following their spouses in terms of work or study. They have cut the apron strings. Who can really argue that they are not truly independent of their parents? This measure is illogical and must be overturned. The coalition will be maintaining the status quo. I am pleased to see that other parties in the Senate have come to the same conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sought to find out some of the reasons for this ALP government's singling out this group of tertiary students in terms of eligibility for the independent Austudy rate. The answer partly lies in the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This says that a person cannot be discriminated against on the basis of marital status. Under Austudy, prior to these regulations, married couples got the independent rate while a de facto couple did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is good reason for this, because the definition of `de facto' is so broad that large-scale rorting of the system could have occurred. For example, relationships of convenience developed in student housing so that the students involved could get the more lucrative independent rate. This government was lazy and arrogant in not tackling this problem of definition. It could have decided on a fair and workable definition for genuine student de facto relationships. This would have removed the need to discriminate against any group. But the ALP minister chose to penalise married students who genuinely deserve the independent rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is all this hurt and uncertainty for young married students because the Labor government could not find, with the help of its vast bureaucracy, a simple definition for de facto relationships.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 is an omnibus bill which amends several primary industry acts: firstly, the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. While the opposition agrees with most of the bill, we are extremely concerned about the amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act to allow the government to bypass state governments to undertake regional adjustment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the National Farmers Federation has agreed to regional plans for restructuring an area, but many farmers are worried about the individual property enterprise agreements which are being pushed in the south-west Queensland rural adjustment strategy. There also seems to be a clear indication that in western New South Wales the push for restructuring is coming from the top down but there is pressure on the local community to make it look as if restructuring is being sought by the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware that the amendments now before us will allow the rural adjustment scheme to operate effectively at a regional level rather than through state governments. The amendments provide for written agreements to be entered into with persons other than a state for grants of money or loans relating to rural adjustment. The regional approach will not replace the existing state based programs. It will be in addition to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we need to know whether these regional restructuring plans will result in the federal government taking over land management which is the prerogative of the states. For this reason, the coalition has already referred this particular legislation to a Senate committee for further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that senators note these particular issues at a time when the primary industries of Australia are feeling extreme effects from not only the drought but also the economic consequences of many of the policies of a federal Labor administration and the compounding effects, particularly of interest rates, that have had their effect right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second act which is being amended by this particular piece of legislation is the Livestock Diseases Act 1978. This act is to be repealed to remove the Commonwealth's responsibility for exotic disease eradication activities in the Australian Capital Territory and to remove the Commonwealth's liability for payment of compensation to ACT producers whose property is destroyed or damaged as a result of exotic disease. The ACT will now join with the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory in the Commonwealth-states cost sharing agreement for sharing the costs of exotic animal disease eradication campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994 is also amended. This is to change the starting date for the registration activities of the National Registration Authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals from 1994 to 1995. In addition, the government claims that experience in collecting this interim levy has highlighted the need for amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments include changing the date of payment of the levy from 1 June to 31 July each year. It is claimed that this will remove the necessity for industry to pay both the interim levy and the main levy during the 1994-95 financial year. The NRA will also be able to approve payments by instalments. The amendments to the late penalty payment provisions will allow for those payments to be set by primary  legislation rather than prescribed by regulations in accordance with the concerns previously expressed by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment affects the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987. This act is amended so that the Australian Dried Fruits Board or any other product board that is established under the act in future will not have to call a special annual general meeting. Instead, in future the chairperson of the product board must report to the annual general meeting of the product board's eligible industry body. The Dried Fruits Board sought this change. It will also allow a member of the board of the AHC to report to the eligible industry board annually rather than specifying the chairperson. There are now nine such eligible bodies and more indicating a desire to join. It is difficult for one person to attend all their annual meetings. The same types of amendments are made to the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987, which now has 11 member bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in relation to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 there are now provisions for amendments which will allow the payment of farm household support to farmers who have reached the pension age by deleting the definition of `pension age'. We agree with this. I indicate that, subject to the considerations of the Senate committee which will look at those important aspects relating to rural adjustment, the coalition will be supporting this legislation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (12.50 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Tambling very clearly put it in outlining the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3), this bill is a package designed to make changes to various primary industry acts. The change to the Livestock Diseases Act to include the ACT in the exotic disease eradication programs is an obvious change given that, despite the ACT's small size, there are rural holdings still in it. I do not know how much longer that will remain because of the way the city is spreading, but it would be patently anomalous for the ACT government not to share the burden of controlling exotic disease outbreak when its next-door neighbours in New South Wales have that responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of course would hope that it may never occur but, as we have seen in the recent outbreak of human disease from smallgoods, disease outbreaks do occur. Some years ago in Tasmania there was an outbreak of what appeared at the time to be foot-and-mouth disease. The campaign to isolate the property affected, trace backwards and forwards the stock movements from it, and isolate and destroy the affected animals was a massive campaign. As history now records, it was not foot-and-mouth disease, and Australia remains free of that deadly disease. But the exercise was expensive, and compensation was involved. As I said, it was not foot-and-mouth disease. It was traced to incorrect feeding of smallgoods to pigs&mdash;but the potential is there. If a similar situation occurred in the ACT, the ACT government ought to expect to share the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the agricultural and veterinary chemical products interim levy collection procedures are again a straightforward and necessary amendment to accommodate real world experience. The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act is a similar industry-driven change. The changes to the Rural Adjustment Act, however, in my view and in the view of other coalition senators&mdash;I am quite sure Senator Crane will make some further remarks on this later&mdash;need further examination. In essence, the proposed amendments would allow written agreement to be entered into by the federal government with persons other than a state agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate would be aware, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has just completed a lengthy study of the efficacy and effectiveness of the rural adjustment scheme and came up with some very strong views and conclusions. During our inquiry we took evidence on the issue of regional rural adjustment programs. One in particular that we comment on in the report is that in the south-west mulga lands of Queensland which the committee visited. That program seems to be working very well. It had a grassroots-up application, though. One of the reasons why I think there should be an inquiry is to find out whether this should be applied downwards or upwards as far as the implementation of it is concerned&mdash;that is, whether it should come from the federal government down or whether it should come from the grassroots up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department, in its evidence to the committee, mooted such changes as the legislation proposed. I think Neil Inall was a great proponent of it, as were others, during the inquiry. As I say, Mr Neil Inall, the Chairman of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, supported it very much. It is fair to say that the committee was very supportive of the view that a regional approach is a good way to go. However, against that support one needs to examine the mechanisms of such a change. I think the rural and regional affairs committee will examine those issues, and I believe it is appropriate that it does that. Funding arrangements, for example, where regional projects transect state boundaries need to be looked at to find out what happens there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a political equity question here, in that the government of the day could use this mechanism to direct funds to a region for political purposes. Given the recent history of the sports funding activities and the attitude of the government, it is highly likely that RAS funds could become pork barrels for regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state agencies also have to be considered. What impact would these direct arrangements have on the functions and role of the state agencies? I do not think the amendments as they are outlined in this bill really cover those aspects. We are all too frequently aware of examples of sloppy drafting across a wide range of bills. It is not uncommon to have legislation in this place fixing up one unintended consequence or another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wonder whether the funding will come from a regional program or out of RAS. Basically, if it intends to do things regionally, maybe it should come out of the regional development program. I want to know whether it will definitely be grassroots up or whether it will be imposed one way or another. Will it bypass the states and will it be pushed down, as I have already said? Will the RAS funding come out of underspends or will it come out of new money as a regional approach to RAS? Those are some of the questions that have to be answered. Obviously, the benefit of these Friday committees is that we can get those answers and have a much better informed debate here in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that, by referring the bill to a committee that is intimately interested in the operation of RAS, as the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee and the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee are, we might overcome some of the drafting glitches and unintended consequences that may over time become apparent in this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to contribute to this debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994. I am just going to concentrate on the aspect of rural adjustment. It is fair to say that, whether it is right or wrong, the committee report into rural adjustment demonstrated quite clearly that there is enormous confusion out in the farming sector as to how rural adjustment works. There is a lot of concern that it is not adequately meeting the current requirements of rural adjustment in Australia. There is also concern about the different interpretations between the states and a whole range of matters which came before the committee which put together the report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Panizza. It is a pity we are not on broadcast; it could go out to Merredin or Southern Cross, couldn't it? No doubt you will send them a note. Some of the points I want to raise have been touched on by Senator Brownhill and Senator Tambling. The point that I want to make first and foremost is that it is absolutely essential that the rural adjustment process is understood in country centres and works as intended. The evidence clearly showed that that is not the case. It is important that the government picks up most, if not all&mdash;I would suggest all&mdash;of the key recommendations of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first recommendation I want to deal with is that we should give it a positive focus rather than a negative focus, which it currently has. It needs to be renamed and called the rural enhancement scheme or the rural promotion scheme. It needs to be called something positive, unlike the rural adjustment scheme, which is negative. When you talk to people about RAS, as it is generally known, there is a negative thought about it before you even start, and that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that we have agreed to refer this bill to a Friday committee, and I will not spend a lot of time discussing this now, but it is important that we look very carefully at this so-called regional focus. When it is said quickly and looked at on the first glance, nobody has any problems with a regional focus; but then the problem comes in. I want to relate this to exceptional circumstances, because exceptional circumstances has a local focus. There is a drought or a flood or a fire or whatever the particular aspect is in a particular area concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the provisions with regard to exceptional circumstances have a long way to go before they are satisfactory in terms of how they are determined, how they are administered, how the funds are delivered, who is eligible and who is not eligible. Why is a line drawn in a particular place when, from the information that we have brought before us, in many instances a person on the outside of the line is in a situation no different to that of one on the inside of the line? Information has been brought to me in recent weeks that in New South Wales there are a number of cases outside the line that are significantly worse off than some of those that are inside the line. They seem to be significant cases, as they have been reported to me, but I have not had a chance to check them personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these aspects have to be looked at very carefully and very thoroughly. How is it going to be administered? Is it going to be administered direct from the Commonwealth to the person or persons? Is it going to be done through shire councils? Is it going to be done through farm advisers? If people wish to get involved as a group in one of these regional programs, what structure do they have to put in place? The legislation does not spell out any of this type of thing. As Senator Brownhill quite rightly identified, as things operate it could well become open to political abuse. That is one of my main concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern which I must emphasise here again&mdash;and I think I have touched on it briefly&mdash;is that we must have a system in which there is equity between regions or areas as to how they are treated and how they are assessed. How are we going to deal with a particular region that, for example, might be primarily grazing or wool growing, as against a particular region that is primarily grain growing? We can throw horticulture in there; we can throw in almost anything. Is it going to deal with the fishing industry? What is their position in terms of that and restructuring of it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of these questions are answered in what I have seen of the legislation or in the explanatory memorandum, and they all need to be examined thoroughly before this goes anywhere down that path. If it were possible, I would certainly be insisting that we see the regulations or, preferably, that we have amendments put in the act which spell all these things out. I know you cannot write every single word into a piece of legislation, but you need some very thorough guidelines in the legislation so that people know exactly how it stands and how it is going to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back for a moment to the exceptional circumstances arrangements, which, as I said, have a regional focus depending on what the circumstances are. They are administered through the states in conjunction with the existing rural adjustment authorities. My preferred position, when dealing on a regional basis, would be to maintain that particular arrangement through the states with a changed focus and a changed name. Having said that, I would like to see from the department and from the minister what the actual proposals are and what the plans are to deal with some of the matters that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point which I think needs spelling out very clearly is: what will be the criteria in terms of the individuals who make the application? Can a minimum of five operations make the application, or will there be a necessity for a minimum of 20? Does it include small businesses in terms of towns and restructuring? Does it include farming operations or grazing operations that as part of their operation have an adjunct of some other small business operation? Will there be limits on the amount of finance that is available to go into any one scheme?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where will the funding come from? Senator Brownhill raised a very valid point. Will it come out of existing rural adjustment funds? Will it come out of regional development funding? Will there be new money? From reading the newspaper reports in recent days on the problems the government has with the deficit and the budget process, I doubt whether it will be new money. I think we can just about rule that one out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But all these questions and points, if this is the focus of the way that the process is going to go, need to be put on the table; they need to be answered. I believe there need to be additional changes to the legislation to make it more clear and we need to have the regulations delivered to us so we know, when we go to finalising this legislation, precisely and exactly what we are voting for and what it is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last question I wish to raise in this debate is purely and simply: what will be the long-term future of the various rural adjustment authorities round the states as we know them now? Is it the intention, for example, to gradually phase them out? Will this regional focus take over some of the roles and functions that they have now? Will there be a capacity, in terms of the regional focus, to go direct to an individual farmer? One can go on and on. It just raises so many questions that are unanswered. We will be going to the Friday committee, and I give notice to the people from the department who are coming to that committee, that we need to have some very specific, precise answers to some of the things that have been raised here. There is, of course, a whole host of other issues that I, Senator Brownhill and, I presume, Senator Woodley will be asking with regard to this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994. This bill makes a number of amendments to programs within the primary industries and energy portfolio, but I will restrict myself today to commenting simply on those sections which deal with the farm household support scheme and the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in this bill to the Farm Household Support Act will remove the restriction that farm household support payments are not available to those who are of pension age or older. In November last year, the New South Wales Synod of the Uniting Church put out a report which summarised the concerns that came out of a meeting of rural financial counsellors in New South Wales. In that report, the church said that one group of people who have been identified by counsellors as falling through the welfare safety net were some farmers over 65 years of age&mdash;presumably mostly males. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that some of these older farmers find themselves in the position whereby their overdraft is at the limit and no extension is available from their creditors. They are ineligible for the age pension or any other social security payment because of the level of their assets&mdash;in other words, their farms&mdash;and do not qualify for a drought relief payment. On top of all this, up until now, they have also been ineligible for any assistance under the farm household support scheme simply because of their age. Assistance has been restricted to those who are over 16 but have not reached pension age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have never been very strong supporters of the farm household support scheme, primarily because it is operated as a loan system rather than a grant scheme. As such, I was not at all surprised to hear the evidence given by numerous people to the recent RAS inquiry to the effect that the farm household support scheme, in the words of one witness, `has been the greatest failure.' It has been said before in this place, and I will say it again, that the last thing people who have exhausted every source of commercial credit available to them need is another loan hanging over their heads. Given that the chances of being able to sell a farming property these days are pretty slim, that is what farm household support recipients ultimately end up with&mdash;a loan accruing interest at commercial rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the introduction of this scheme, the Democrats have argued that payment should be provided as a grant and not as a loan. It should be remembered that these payments go to farm families who have no money whatsoever, who have no capacity to borrow from any financial institution, and that the payments are solely to cover the family's day-to-day living expenses. My colleague, Senator Lees, made some comments in 1992 about the loan aspect of this scheme. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically, this amounts to the government making money out of alleviating poverty. To make it clear, we are talking about farmers who need a payment to put food on the table, but they may end up after two years with a debt of some $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA>For those people who received farm household support when it was first introduced, the two years will be up next month, at which time they will begin to be charged interest and they will have to start making repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are among some of Australia's worst off farmers, and they are being penalised for not being able to sell up their properties and get out of farming altogether. Given the situation in rural Australia at the moment, farmers in many parts of Australia would be lucky to give their farms away, let alone to sell them. In spite of this, these people are soon going to have to start repaying a debt to the Commonwealth. It is a debt accumulated while they were basically living in poverty; a debt on which the government will charge a commercial interest rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the Democrats believe that, since the object of farm household support payments is solely to cover the day-to-day living expenses of totally destitute farm families, the payments should be made as a grant. The Democrats will not be opposing the extension of eligibility to the scheme to those who have reached the pension age, so it may at least provide short-term relief for some of those farmers identified by the Uniting Church as being in great financial difficulty. In spite of this, we urge the government to undertake a review of this whole scheme as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendments in the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 which refer to the rural adjustment scheme. These amendments will provide greater flexibility to the rural adjustment scheme in its delivery of assistance. In particular, the bill will enable RAS assistance to be provided on a regional basis, in addition to being provided through the usual state adjustment authorities. The Democrats are pleased to see this added flexibility. Although we share the concerns raised by Senator Crane, given that the amendments are framed with goodwill, we are pleased to see this added flexibility being incorporated into the scheme as it is something for which the farm sector has been calling for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate some of the comments I made last week. As senators will be aware, the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs completed an inquiry into the operation of the rural adjustment scheme and presented its report late last year. Although the terms of reference for that inquiry were reasonably wide and the evidence received pointed to some of the fundamental problems with rural industry and communities, the report of the committee was basically limited to operating within the existing government framework, but gave some attention to the issue of rural debt. The report concentrated on making amendments to the current rural adjustment scheme and did not consider the overall question of what policies are really needed in this area. This means that most of the recommendations contained in the report, while they will improve the rural adjustment scheme if they are implemented, do not get at some of the much deeper problems facing Australia's farmers and rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the committee's recommendations, but to fully comprehend and to begin to rectify the enormous problems in rural Australia today, we need to go beyond the scope of that inquiry to get at the problem raised in many of the submissions. The evidence which was presented certainly went far beyond the scope of the report as it is written. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask ourselves: how can it be that family farms which have been viable for generation after generation are suddenly so unviable that the current generation is being forced to sell up and leave the land? I think the answer to that question would expose some far greater problems than we have covered in the report of the RAS inquiry. As I said a moment ago, many of the submissions went deeper but I believe the report does not address those submissions adequately. In many ways, I believe the drought has masked these deeper problems. The drought has certainly pushed a great number of farms to crisis point and beyond and the media has played a useful role in showing this to the broader community, pointing out and underlying the desperation that there is in country Australia. But the problems facing Australia's farmers go far deeper than just the drought. I would like to outline for the Senate what I see are some of these deeper problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those is the problem, or perhaps more accurately, the epidemic of rural debt. The epidemic has been brought about by high interest rates, by various banking practices, by advice and encouragement to farmers to get big or get out and, regrettably, by insufficient scrutiny and monitoring by farmers of the financial advice given to them. The issue of rural debt was touched on very briefly by the committee in the RAS inquiry but I believe it is an area which needs far greater attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other problems and I raised these last week. There are problems such as land degradation, the effect on farmers of being part of the global economic system, the problem of the removal of government resources from rural areas, and the entry into industry of large international agribusiness which is increasing foreign ownership of Australian resources and subsequently bringing about a reduction in the number of Australia's family farming operations. And there is what I believe is a total lack of any&mdash;I was going to say government but really it is all of us&mdash;real commitment to the maintenance of rural communities and infrastructure. The exodus from the bush continues as it has for the last 20 years and I do not see any policy from any party which really addresses that. There is no policy direction from either the government or the coalition which is committed to the maintenance of population and industry in inland Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final problem I see is the deliberate walking away from policies of cross-subsidisation. It has become a dirty word but they were policies on which Australia was built and on which many of our rural and remote regions rely. These are some of the deeper problems which are facing rural Australia today and these are the issues that we are going to have to address if we are serious about rectifying the growing gulf between rural and urban Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the current rural adjustment scheme&mdash;and I admit the benefit that it is to some farmers&mdash;is that its two foci are designed to make viable farms more viable and to remove all other farmers from rural industry altogether. That is a policy for continuing down the same disastrous track&mdash;disastrous from my point of view. While some would see that it may produce a viable rural industry, I would see it as continuing the dramatic exodus from the bush. We need to ask ourselves whether or not we want to see the family farm survive in this country or whether we are happy to stand by and see those farms taken over by investors and foreign owned agribusiness. The Democrats are committed to fighting to protect the family farm as we believe it is an essential part of the fabric that is rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza for his comments and rise also to indicate the support of the opposition for the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill 1994. The purpose, as Senator Panizza has outlined, is to create a uniform system of regulation across Australia in terms of the movement of dangerous goods through various states. In regard to dangerous goods it follows from the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991, where the intention was to create uniform legislation. If this bill is adopted by the parliament, the provisions of the act and the regulations, which constitute the flowing on from the earlier act, will become the primary law in the states and territories in relation to the transport of dangerous goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why we need this legislation relates to the problem that we currently have with a series of different regulations across the states at a time when often we have large trucks moving material from places like Perth to the eastern seaboard. Under the current system each state requires a series of things to happen but they are not uniform. Not only is this situation incredibly inconvenient for the truck operators but it is also extremely expensive. I would just like to give some examples of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A dangerous goods registration and licence for a prime mover is required in Victoria. That is not required in other states. New South Wales state law deems a trailer to be unregistered if the registration label is lost, and there are heavy fines attached to that. That does not apply in other states. The Victorian dangerous goods branch requires additional excess flow valves to be fitted to LPG tankers. Other states do not. An example of the problem when one of these road transports cross Australia relates to a regulation like AS3788. The Victorian authorities have a different standard for the testing of LPG gas tankers from those in South Australia and New South Wales in terms of frequency and the area subject to extra stress. So the person in business has to meet a whole range of standards relating to that particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have problems of non-recognition of other jurisdiction approvals or testing inspections. This is a point of contention and re-testing is often done using different criteria in various states. I have an example of one company and the great inconvenience it was caused by the current situation of different sets of regulations. The transport manager of a Perth firm which carts dangerous bulk goods and liquids awarded a contract for the construction of a 25-triaxial B-double trailer to a Queensland company. When this piece of equipment was finished, it had to be moved. Honourable senators must keep in mind that this was a new trailer; it was not carrying any goods at all at this point. The company required operating permits to move it from Brisbane to Perth to pass through the various states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the New South Wales government nor the Commonwealth government had in place legislation to deal with this type of vehicle. It was therefore necessary to avoid transit through New South Wales. The vehicle had to be moved via the Innamincka Track. Three sets of operating permits were then required for Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Both South Australia and Western Australia required the trailer to be inspected by the dangerous goods inspectors and each inspection cost over $10,000. That example shows the ridiculous nature of the situation that we have had up to this point in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes this bill. This legislation is an essential part of micro-economic reform. One of this country's great costs to a whole range of goods is the transport component: these inspections have cost the economy and increased the price of the good. This legislation is an excellent example of micro-economic reform; it is an excellent example of cooperation between the state and federal levels of government. Federation took place in 1901. I am absolutely amazed that it has taken until 1995 for such legislation to be put in place. </PARA>

That motion and debate took place because of legitimate community concerns.

It will not have to go through the normal process of the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill 1994. Or will it? Perhaps, when we briefly move into the committee stage of this bill, I will be able to ask this question of the minister: exactly what kind of assurances does this bill give us when we have these huge problems involving a lack of scrutiny and involving slackness in relation to transport of radioactive waste and toxic waste simply because it happens to be done by ANSTO or ADI?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I refer the minister to reports this week of a survey by Monash University and Ernst and Young which shows that manufacturers are still in the early stages of quality control development and which concludes that a lack of understanding of management practices is acting as a major impediment to quality improvement. Given the need for Australian manufacturing to continue its strong output and export growth, can the minister indicate what impact these findings may have on the future performance of the manufacturing sector? Is the minister taking any action to address these concerns?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a timely survey because it shows us what progress the manufacturing sector of the Australian economy is making in responding to changes in the international marketplace and suiting itself up for international competition. The Monash-Ernst and Young survey canvassed 1,000 manufacturing firms across a wide range of manufacturing sectors. It compared results of a similar survey in 1991 with this survey, which was taken in 1993, and came to some conclusions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those conclusions are a little worrying, but others point the direction to the future. It found that Australian manufacturers are in the early stages of picking up quality principles for their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of quality is not as widespread in the manufacturing psyche as we would like to see. Only 10 per cent of Australian firms are fully certificated in their business for quality principles. That compares to a worldwide average of 20 per cent, and around one-third of companies do not practice quality management techniques, like total quality management, in their human resources, administration or marketing area. They think of quality only in terms of products and product development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures confirm the Australian Manufacturing Council's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leading the way</EMPHASIS>, which was released last year, which suggests that about 35 per cent of Australian firms are not yet ready for competition in the international marketplace. It is also estimated that about 10 to 20 per cent of Australian manufacturers are actively engaged in export, indicating that a large number of them have not yet turned on to the opportunities of export in the international economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I believe there is going to be continuing and sustained growth in Australian manufacturing into the future and why I have a quite buoyant outlook about the future of this sector. We have been increasing manufacturing exports year on year for the last 10 years by about 16 per cent. It has been growing dramatically. But what we see from these figures is that a smaller band than we would like to see of Australian manufacturing companies is responsible for that dramatic growth in exports and for that widening of our export base, but there are many more companies that have not yet got the message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the objective of government policy is to push principles of world best practice to encourage industry benchmarking, to encourage the quality mission, total quality management, and to spread, by way of example of successful Australian exporters, successful Australian innovators and successful Australian companies, that these principles embodied in managerial practice in our manufacturing sector will mean that Australia is on an ever onward ever upward burgeoning path for manufactures of exports and be able to more widely and aggressively compete in the international market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason for that confidence in our manufacturing sector is that the Ernst and Young survey found that more than 50 per cent of Australian firms have started the process of quality certification. That compares with 35 per cent of overseas firms. In the Working Nation statement brought down by the Prime Minister last year, we have encoded a series of programs and policies which will ensure the spread of best practice, the spread of quality management in Australian manufacturing and the take up of those principles and concepts. I am certain that the government, working closely with this important and strategic industry sector, will be able to broaden the economic base of this country and offer Australians long-term quality jobs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a whole series of meetings with representatives of this extremely important Australian industry&mdash;and it employs thousands of Australians in permanent jobs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeated to them this morning the assurance I have given them previously, and they accepted it.

I have invited representatives of the Australian Veterinary Association to be included in that delegation and, of course, the industry itself will be involved in that delegation which will inspect at first hand the processes that are going to be used in factories that may export chicken meat to Australia to ensure that the highest standards of processing possible are carried out in those factories.

Is this suggested framework a realistic means of building a better climate for trade and economic cooperation among the littoral states of the Indian Ocean?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Loosley for his question. I understand that the foreign affairs and trade committee had a meeting with the Executive Deputy President this morning, as I had the pleasant opportunity to do. Amongst the issues discussed was the question of the development of relationships around the Indian Ocean and the significant changes that have taken place&mdash;the political transformation in South Africa and the economic transformation in India&mdash;the combined effect of those and their implications, particularly from my point of view for trade, but my colleague the foreign minister is interested in their security implications also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did have an exchange of views about that, having read what Mr de Klerk had said. It was quite clear that we share a view about the value of developing relationships around the Indian Ocean rim, about developing some sort of Indian Ocean identity, but we also agreed on the need to proceed in a very measured process with this. We are not talking about rushing into setting up secretariats, organisations, committee meetings and formal structures. I do not think any littoral state of the Indian Ocean is currently interested in the development of anything as structured as that. It may eventually lead to that, but that is not envisaged at the moment and is not within sight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some important steps being taken. We welcome the fact that Mr de Klerk has said this. Last August the Australian government, on the basis of a joint submission from the foreign minister and me, endorsed the `Looking West' strategy to lift our priority of focus towards the Indian Ocean and we have had welcome cooperative discussions with the Western Australian government with regard to this matter because much of the interest and priority in Australia is focused, of course, in Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a trade point of view, the interest is focused much more broadly. On Sunday I will be leading a trade mission to India and next month to South Africa. In both of those instances there will be substantial interest from companies based on the east coast as well as the substantial west coast interest. I think those trade missions will build on the successful activities, led by the special trade representative in 1993 and 1994 to those countries, and build the developing interest of the Australian private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the foreign minister and I are promoting further discussions of this broader issue of Indian Ocean relationships. There will be discussions of a less official nature at a conference in Mauritius in March. Australia will be hosting such a conference in Perth in June, fundamentally under the initiative of the Australian government but with the cooperation of the Western Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not in any way to imply that Australia is lessening its focus on APEC. APEC and its region and, in particular, the east Asia-western Pacific region remain the primary focus of Australian trade interest. We do need to have a global approach to trade. Australia is and always has been a global trader. As the opportunities develop in the Indian Ocean, we are committed to continuing to maintain the focus on that.</PARA>

We have, indeed, provided $6 million in funding for that proposal. It was not delayed because of a funding problem. The delay was entirely outside the hands of the government in that, when all of the negotiations had been completed and it was about to be launched, both of the private organisations involved had significant corporate changes&mdash;simultaneously, as it happened. That required a complete re-look at the previous agreements by the lawyers that were then involved. I understand there has been no hitch to that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reality of the situation is that Australia does very strongly support indefinite extension of that treaty at the forthcoming review conference. We see that as being a major factor in locking in the significant achievements in disarmament which have occurred since the end of the Cold War and to provide the most propitious environment for continued nuclear reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does need to be appreciated that, whatever may have been the case about the article 6 obligations prior to the end of the Cold War, there has been an extraordinary degree of movement pursuant to article 6 in those last few years. The United States and Russia, under the START process, have certainly begun the crucially important process of making deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals; and of course we have had a situation where the former Soviet states which inherited nuclear weapons&mdash;the Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus&mdash;all both have joined the NPT and are working towards eliminating nuclear weapons on their territories. Those cuts are real, they have occurred and they are continuing. We want that state of affairs to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We take the view that indefinite extension provides the best way to advance the goal of universal adherence and, in particular, to convince non-parties&mdash;including, again, in particular, those with unsafeguarded nuclear programs in regions of proliferation concern&mdash;to rethink their attitude to the NPT and abide by the international norm the treaty has so successfully created. We want a reinforcement of that norm and to create an environment in which there is an assumption of perpetuity about it, so that those states which might be minded to succumb to the temptation of going down the proliferation path will not be doing so with any other belief than that the NPT regime will be permanent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the indefinite extension as also providing the most stable environment for peaceful nuclear cooperation programs, which has always been the other side of the NPT equation. That is essential for major power and research reactor programs, which do require long-term assurances extending over four or five decades from both suppliers and recipients. Senator Margetts, I know you cannot be expected to express any enthusiasm for the peaceful nuclear program; you do not accept it. But you do need to understand that was always part of the NPT trade-off formula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NPT has been criticised for legitimising the nuclear haves versus the have-nots.

We supported a Japanese resolution to that effect in the United Nations recently. We have continued to urge the nuclear weapons states themselves to squarely embrace that, not just regard it as some kind of fanciful wish list.

There are many more countries around the world than the nuclear weapons states which see the advantages of indefinite extension of the NPT in exactly the same terms as we do&mdash;as creating a better environment for ensuring non-proliferation in those areas which do not have nuclear weapons at the moment, as well as creating a better environment for the nuclear weapons states themselves to negotiate further deep cuts, hopefully leading towards eventual elimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the peaceful program being a cover somehow for an intended nuclear future for Australia, I repeat that the truth of the matter is that peaceful nuclear cooperation was the price paid for support for the NPT. The developing countries and the non-nuclear countries all wanted assurances that they would be able to develop nuclear power and so on peacefully. They demanded that as the price of agreeing to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty itself. It is a crucial part of the equation, and that is the basis on which we are supporting that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Don't you want to know about citizenship? The issue that Senator Evans raises was a major focus for Australia Day this year. It is part of an ongoing campaign that the government has been running for some time. The new ads that you did see, Senator Evans, are part of the second phase of that campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign has been running successfully. In fact, more than 11,000 people became Australian citizens on Australia Day. As a consequence of the promotions on that day, the number of queries the department received the next day was double the daily average. The promotion has been going for some time and there was a big focus on Australia Day. We are now embarking upon a new phase in the campaign, involving new television ads&mdash;the ones that you noticed&mdash;as well as ads in other aspects of the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the campaign builds on the first part by interviewing those who took up citizenship in the first part of the campaign. The ads that have been developed as part of the second phase pick up some of the concerns that those people raised, in fact some of the aspirations that those people decided they would meet by taking out Australian citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the new phase of the campaign which started a few days ago, I should say that on the first working day after the new ads were shown the telephone inquiry line received 1,300 calls and more than half of the people who called asked for application kits to be sent to them immediately. It is not just a TV campaign; it will be run in ethnic and suburban newspapers as well. The campaign will be officially launched this weekend in Melbourne at Station Pier, a place where the first postwar migrants from Britain and Europe disembarked some half a century ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans, your question also gives me the opportunity to focus on the success of the overall campaign so far. Though we are only halfway through it, I can say that the response from the community continues to be extremely encouraging. When Prime Minister Keating and I announced last November that we aimed to encourage a substantial proportion of the 1.1 million or so eligible permanent residents to take up citizenship we anticipated running a campaign, but we did not anticipate the success of the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the telephone hotline has been part of the overall campaign, it has taken nearly 42,200 calls and a total of 25,800 people have actually lodged formal applications with my department. More than 80 per cent of those new applicants have stated that they were prompted by the advertisements to take this important step. Senator Evans, you were right to focus on the new phase of the campaign which started a few days ago. The government believes that the money we are spending in this area is well spent and the community response I think reflects that.</PARA>

Is it the case that officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised against the decision to sell rifles to the Indonesian military and that Australia is now at odds with the United States, which has deliberately restricted arms sales to Indonesia precisely because of its poor human rights record?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since misunderstandings seem to continue on this subject, let me remind the Senate of the facts of the matter as set out in Senator Ray's statement in this place last week. The government of Indonesia has never requested a substantial purchase of rifles from Australia, be it to the value of $100 million, $10 million or $1 million. ADI, the only producer of military rifles in Australia, has no intention of marketing the Steyr rifle in Indonesia on any kind of significant scale, again be it to the value of $100 million, $10 million or $1 million&mdash;the figures that we have variously seen thrown around. The approval in-principle granted by the government was related to the export of a very small number of rifles, probably of the order of 20 or so, for the purpose of trials and evaluation. Australian firms require this approval in-principle for even such a small number of rifles, and even then proposals for the actual sales, concrete sales, if that is in fact going to follow, are further examined on a case-by-case basis before a specific licence is granted&mdash;all as a result of our rigorous export controls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that human rights considerations, including the possibility of the weapons in question being misused in a civilian human rights invading situation, are taken into account. They are taken into account at this stage and they are taken into account at every other stage of the process, but particularly when it gets to the concrete sale. So, in terms of the assurance that Senator Bourne seeks, I can say that human rights concerns would certainly figure in any consideration of possible proposed defence exports to Indonesia, whether of rifles or of anything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative process by which this is done, if I can just add something to what Senator Ray said last week, is as follows: controls in the export of defence and related goods provide for all applications where there are or might be foreign or strategic policy interests to be referred to the standing interdepartmental committee. In this process every application is considered on a case-by-case basis and in reviewing cases within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has an input into this process, applications are routinely referred to the human rights section and to other relevant sections and departmental recommendations, of course, consequently do take account of human rights considerations. Beyond that I do not think there is anything more I can say. It is about time this particular matter was put once and for all politely to rest.</PARA>

The council announced in December 1994 that seven of the 11 Chinese athletes testing positive were swimmers. One was a track and field athlete, one was a cyclist and two were canoeists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has nothing to do with Andrew Robb, Senator Bolkus&mdash;this is a successful industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agenda for Growth</EMPHASIS> sets out how the association intends to go about building, with the help of the government, the information industry sector in Australia. Of course, as senators would know, this is a key sector which is critical to Australia's growth and prosperity. After all, Australia has the second largest information technology and telecommunications market share in the Asia-Pacific after Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has an information technology and telecommunications market twice the size that of Korea, and it is seven times larger than the markets in Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia. It must be remembered that market growth in this industry sector is very strong in the whole of the region. Our proximity to those markets provides Australia with a real competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find most pleasing in this report is the strong focus the industry itself has chosen to put on exports. That is because it is a successful exporting industry pledged to doing better. This industry sector earned in exports for Australia over the last year $2.6 billion. The industry has set a target to reach $10 billion in export and foreign earnings by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said that $10 billion is the combined size of the coal and iron ore exports of Australia. If the industry succeeds, it would be a great result for this country. A decade ago information industry exports were under four per cent of the coal and iron ore exports. This is a rapidly growing, high technology industry right at the cutting edge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main drivers for this enormous growth is the government's partnerships for development program, which encourages international information and technology and telecommunication firms to expand and invest in Australia. The program also encourages Australian firms to enter into productive export oriented alliances with international companies. When the Bureau of Industry Economics releases its scorecard on the partnerships program later this month, I am sure you will see that there has been a very positive performance by that program. It has stimulated a very positive performance by this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program's successes have in part contributed to overseas business leaders recognising Australia's capability in building and delivering innovative IT&amp;T products and services. Thanks to these strengths, Australia can now claim competitive advantages in many areas, including software development, professional services and local and wide area networking. For our part, we will be working with this very dynamic industry in the future to achieve its vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World leadership in the use of IT&amp;T for our competitive advantage is within our grasp. International recognition of our excellence in IT&amp;T applications and systems is growing strongly. Exports of $10 billion a year by the year 2000 would be a significant presence in this global market. In fact, our future does look very bright here. This is a dynamic industry, succeeding on behalf of this nation in this dynamic market of the world and more broadly around the globe.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="854" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for this question. Senators would know that there was a new protocol introduced in about October last year between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments to deal with the problem of how best to manage young homeless allowance applicants. There certainly were cases raised in this place and we know of requests into our offices of concern about the management of the youth homeless allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protocol agreed between the Commonwealth and the states particularly applies to three groups of people&mdash;under-15-year-olds, wards and others in protective care, and 15- to 17-year-olds at imminent risk of violence or abuse. From October to December over 660 young people were referred to the states and territories and over 80 per cent of those referred were under 15. Since that time there has been industrial action in both New South Wales and Western Australia that has led to considerable difficulties in implementing this new protocol to deal with the youth homeless allowance and with young people who may be in those sorts of difficulties vis-a-vis relationships with their family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales the work ban has been lifted, but Minister Longley's department has said that it would only respond to cases referred under the protocol `when all other work demands had been met'. This was published in the Public Service Association of New South Wales minutes to members dated 1 December 1994. The Commonwealth is also concerned and is still yet to be convinced that the protocol arrangements in Western Australia are operating effectively. The protocol recognises that the states and territories have primary responsibility for young people at risk. If these arrangements are not working satisfactorily, then most vulnerable young people can be forced into highly unsatisfactory living arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will be interested to note that, for example, a 15-year-old boy from Sydney's outer west was referred to the Department of Community Services for assessment. He is unable to live in the parental home due to irreconcilable breakdown caused by a long history of family disharmony. The Department of Community Services in New South Wales placed him in a refuge but was not prepared to provide any other support. The young person needs money for books, a school uniform and other ongoing living matters. The New South Wales government seems to be of the opinion that it does not matter at all and that it is not its responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government believes that, because it funds refuges through the supported accommodation assistance program in conjunction with the Commonwealth, it does not have to do anything other than to see that this person is into a shelter. That is not the terms of the protocol and the Commonwealth is very concerned that the states, particularly New South Wales and Western Australia, seem not to be interested in implementing their part of this protocol for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has contacted both the New South Wales and the Western Australian governments. The Western Australian government replied that it is very concerned and supports the protocol. New South Wales has failed to reply. In this place on occasions we have had passionate concern about the young homeless allowance and the problem it creates for young people. Ongoing concern by the Department of Social Security, but also in response to those sorts of concerns, allowed the governments to come up with a protocol late last year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Chapman this day, relating to space launch capacities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It has become increasingly clear that the minister either does not understand the key issues or is misleading the parliament and the public about the process which is being entered into with the Russian and Australian space proposal currently under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Space Council's own agenda paper, presented by the executive director, Mr Malcolm Farrow, dated 12 December 1994, clearly supports the concerns I have raised publicly and in this place and, furthermore, creates a dispute about the answers given by the minister. I quote from a copy of the leaked document, which follows a recent overseas visit undertaken by the executive director to assess the feasibility of establishing a light launch vehicle site and ongoing operation in Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Russian companies, in general, expressed the most interest in launching from Australia. Both STC Complex (the developer of the START rockets, which are converted ICBM's) and Energomash (manufacturers of all Russian first stage rocket engines) proposed joint ventures with Australian industry to establish launch service operations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STC Complex has proposed a joint venture project to launch the START family of LLVs from Australia. They have a virtually autonomous launch system which would require very little infrastructure beyond the provision of a suitable site. If the technical and economic aspects proved feasible and attractive a launch service could be up and running in a very short space of time once the decision to go ahead was made. It would require relatively little start up capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be very little Australian content in the first instance but it could be a good way of gaining early entry into, and experience of, the market, for a relatively small amount of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional material provided to me highlights the growing concern within the United States about the possible transfer of sensitive missile technology under the MTCR agreement. It is clear that Australia is heavily reliant upon the United States for the importing of rocket motors, guidance systems and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what concerns the United States Department of Defense may have, given Australia's negotiations on this matter with Russia, a country that the minister himself knows is not a signatory to the MTCR agreement. That is the real issue. That is the concern: Russia's non-compliance with the MTCR agreement. It is nothing to do with reds under the bed, as the minister mockingly tries to suggest and scoffs about. Does the minister question that Russia remains a relatively unstable country and that it is not a signatory to this important agreement and that therefore relationships with it in this area are quite risky? This document further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be fool-hardy, however, to believe that the transfer of Category I items&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, rocket motors and guidance systems, et cetera&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would be a `lay down misere'. The US Department of Defence position is that presumption to deny means `no transfer to anyone for any reason at anytime!'</PARA>
<PARA>The document further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . US goodwill towards Australia would be sorely tested if the issue of technology transfer is raised in the absence of definite proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have seen is Australia wanting to secure sensitive missile technology from the United States under the MTCR agreement while at the same time encouraging the Russians to enter into a joint venture with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister really is playing with fire in this instance. If he proceeds with this bizarre proposal without adequate protection, he is likely to get burnt as he has indeed been when he has proceeded with other proposals without adequate consideration. We remember the Australian Institute of Marine Science and his problems with the customs department. This minister is accident prone. I urge the minister to give very careful consideration to this Russian proposal, given the serious implications it could have for Australia's involvement in the MTCR, not to mention Australia's relations with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the MTCR was clearly designed to protect sensitive missile technology. There is considerable concern within the industry groups about the impact this Russian project could have upon future United States-Australia relations. The minister must come clean with what he is proposing and stop hiding behind the shroud of secrecy that he ha until now imposed on this project. He has been caught out by the admissions of his own department. The potential for Australia's participation in the launch of missiles should not be jeopardised. It is an important part of our future and it ought not to be jeopardised by this minister's incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to repeat the main issue to the minister so that it is quite clear. The main issue is that the MTCR agreement precludes Russia and, therefore, any negotiations with Russia prior to it becoming a signatory. Any negotiations with Russia place Australia's relations with its allies at substantial risk. It is a risk that the minister ought not be taking. I urge him to reconsider it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out to Senator Chapman that the very same Russian companies are in discussions with and, quite openly and quite transparently, have provided assistance to a range of European, Asian and North American companies. We are not the only country to have discussions with the Russians and we are not the only country with which the Russian companies have sought to have discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know where the feasibility study will lead over the next few months. However, it was the advice to me from the Executive Director of the Australian Space Office&mdash;with, as I understand it, the support of the Australian Space Council&mdash;that this discussion and these negotiations with the Russians should take place and should be funded by the Space Office. I have agreed to that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the papers you quote do is point out the facts. I do not deny that the Russians and the Americans may have some differences of opinion. But we are a sovereign country. We will make our own decisions on what is in our best national and commercial interest. We will weigh that up in conjunction with information we get and consultations we have with countries such as the United States, Russia and any other country. We made that very clear from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are on what I would call a `beat-up purpose' here. You are trying to drag it out as though Russia is still some part of the old Soviet Union and the Cold War is still going. That is what you are on about. What I am surprised about, Senator Chapman, is that three or four years ago you signed, like I did, the major recommendations, unanimous recommendations as they were, of the Senate committee on transport dealing with space launch facilities in Australia. All I have been doing as a minister is carrying out the thrust and the principles of that report, which I thought you and the Senate would have been very pleased about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at every possibility to get a commercially viable space launch activity going in Australia. Certainly, we have to look at all the opportunities, not just those in the United States. They may not choose to provide us with some of their technology. The Russians may choose not to provide us with some of their technology. If that is the case, so be it. We will negotiate our best opportunities for Australia's interest. I can assure you that in doing so we will abide by all the international treaties that we have signed. That is certainly the policy of this government. To suggest that the Space Office itself is going off on its own venture without cognisance of these treaty obligations is absolutely without foundation. I certainly understand all those obligations and they will be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think we would be stupid to ignore an opportunity that could occur after these discussions and studies with these two Russian companies. If it transpires at the end of those studies that we would be in transgression of any international treaty, then that would be the end of those opportunities. But to write them off before we even have a chance to discuss them or find out what they are offering or what the opportunities are for Australian industry is absurd.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services, to a question without notice asked by Senator Troeth this day, relating to funding for children's services.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to be taking note of an answer in which the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) said that she had nothing to say. I think the fact that the minister had nothing to say proves the significance of what I was asking. She maintained that she could neither confirm nor deny the substance of my question. Yet Senator Cook called the substance of my question a lie. I can only presume that he has superior knowledge to that of the minister in charge of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Senator Cook and Senator Crowley may be interested to know that my information was taken from a report on page 1 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which spoke of possible cuts and mentioning an amount of $280 million from children's services. To put the lie to Senator Cook's description of what was stated in my question as being a lie, I direct attention to the words of a spokeswoman of the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, who confirmed that the leaked figures were budget proposals from economic bureaucrats. So I would presume&mdash;and I am sure the Senate would presume&mdash;that they must be on the government's agenda for budget cuts. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has also refused to comment on these possible budget cuts. This whole attitude by the government simply creates turmoil for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the start of this new year of 1995, Australian families in many cases are preparing for parents to take up new careers or jobs which entail child-care arrangements for their families; and, at the same time, child-care centres are planning their staffing commitments and the way in which they will operate in the new year of 1995. What are they to make of these extremely conflicting reports coming from government sources that there will be a means test on the child-care rebate, there may be a more stringent means test on the home child care-allowance, and so on? No-one knows what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday there was no answer from Senator Crowley on the matter of child-care rebate means testing. Once again, we have a classic policy division and another nasty choice for the Prime Minister. In the logging debate which took place last week, we saw the government having to make a very nasty choice between the demands of the logging and forestry industries and the demands of the environmental industry. The Labor Party cannot please either of them&mdash;and, from its present intensive efforts, it still appears to be pleasing neither side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In exactly the same way, Mr Keating and Senator Crowley appear to be caught between the femocrats in the Prime Minister's office and Dr Lawrence who maintain that child care should be seen as a work related expense&mdash;and this view is shared by the Womens Electoral Lobby&mdash;and the views of their other supposed allies, such as Martin Ferguson from the ACTU who thinks the child-care allowance should be means tested. Presumably Mr Beazley and Mr Willis, who are keen to adopt programs which will do something about cutting the enormous government deficit, also would be in favour of means testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has claimed from the start that these programs should have been better targeted. The fact that the government of Senator Crowley and Mr Keating made these promises and is now prepared to walk away from them is symptomatic of the way that the government is treating the families of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, we have the child-care rebate non-means tested. In 1995, the same question comes up again. We have no comment from the Prime Minister, we have no answer from Senator Crowley, and we have cautious kite flying from Mr Beazley and, I would suspect, later in the day from Mr Willis. So I say to the Senate that Senator Crowley's intimation that she has nothing to say is indeed symptomatic of the attitude of the whole Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me give Senator Troeth the benefit of the doubt for the moment and accept that in that intervention she is not adopting the Robb instruction or the advertising agency's suggestion to argue in accordance with the proposition that `the object till budget time is to make every welfare recipient feel like they're about to lose it. And if they don't lose it this time, they'll lose it next time'&mdash;one of the more contemptible instructions or political doctrines that any of us have seen in our political memories. I will work on the assumption that she does not mean that and that, for the present purposes, she is acting not in accordance with that but is acting in accordance with her own fundamental misconception about the budgetary process. I suppose that is not surprising. She has not been in government and has no realistic expectation of getting there, so it is not unreasonable that she should not have devoted any attention to understanding the way the budget process works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She refers to this purported cut as being `on the agenda for budget cuts'. Let me say very clearly to Senator Troeth just this: in any budget process, whoever is in government, a whole plethora of documents is prepared. Everybody has a wish list for spending; everybody has a wish list for cuts. Most of those wish lists are prepared deep inside the bowels of departments without ministers even seeing them before they get into some kind of circulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is no different from any other budget in the history of this country in the way that the preliminary skirmishing, manoeuvring and preparation of wish lists proceed. These documents and wish lists&mdash;and I am making no concession that the particular document that you are referring to exists; I have no idea what its status might be or whether there is a bit of paper&mdash;do not have any authority. The vast bulk of them will not only not be adopted on either the expenditure side of the equation or the revenue side of the equation, but will not even appear on the agenda of the expenditure review committee or the revenue committee of cabinet as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of crazy stuff originates from departments on the expenditure wish list side. A lot of crazy stuff, I have to acknowledge, comes on the other side of the equation every year from within the bowels of the finance department. I have been a member of the ERC. I have seen these things; most of them are just nonsense, and their perpetrators do not expect them to see the light of the day. That is the way the budget process works. These things do not have any status whatsoever unless and until they are seriously considered by the formal processes at senior ministerial level and, of course, until they are adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So please let us not have any more of this waving around of bits and pieces that might fall off the bottom and back of trucks, because, I repeat, the overwhelming majority of them do not have any chance of even being seriously considered, let alone adopted. That is what Senator Crowley was effectively saying in the way in which she responded to you. Of course, it is the case that, when any bit of paper is waved around in this context, we do not confirm or deny its status. To do that in the context of a budget preparation would lead you very quickly into a maze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not mean anything to neither confirm nor deny that something is the case.

By and large, we maintain that particular approach; it is without significance. </PARA>

<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate asked a very straightforward question of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) in relation to certain forestry coupes in Tasmania and what occurred in discussions between Paul Lennon and the federal government. In his answer the minister asserted that basically he knew nothing about it and was not going to comment. It would appear that the only person that does not know about this intervention over the head of Senator Faulkner is the minister himself. Let me remind the Senate what Paul Lennon told the</PARA>
<PARA>Tasmanian parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was my intervention, not to Senator Faulkner but directly to the Prime Minister's office, which saw the number reduced to 72. He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to you, Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">can say what he likes, Faulkner has been shown for what Faulkner is in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA>Paul Lennon, the Labor forestry spokesman in Tasmania, received a letter from industry congratulating him, which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand you played a key role in ensuring that the number of coupes to be set aside by the Commonwealth of Tasmania has been reduced by about 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a letter that Paul Lennon quoted in Tasmanian parliament last night when boasting about his activities in reducing the number of coupes. It appears as though the forest industry knows about his success. Paul Lennon undoubtedly does because he is quoting it and very proud of it, yet the minister asserts that he does not know what is going on. The only bright light in the whole debate is that Senator Faulkner has been frozen out and people above and beyond him are now dealing with the problem and, hopefully, resolving it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the Labor Party, and especially this minister, is in an absolute mess over the forest issue. We have seen in this place the resignation of Senator Devereux from the parliamentary Labor Party. Senator Faulkner is potentially responsible for the resignation of another five people from the parliamentary Labor Party and for the inter- and intra-factional warfare that is taking place within his own political party. It is amazing that such a non-entity as a junior Labor spokesman for forestry in Tasmania is able to roll Senator Faulkner, the federal minister for environment, by going directly to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). If ever a Prime Minister has given a vote of no confidence in one of his ministers, I would have thought that this is a classic example. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A problem does not exist here. It exists in Canberra. That is where the problem exists.</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring again to the Labor government and to its complete mishandling of this whole issue. It is simply not good enough that the minister for the environment has come in here in question time after question time for the past fortnight and been completely incapable of or unable to answer questions of substance going to the very heart of this very important matter which is affecting the lives of thousands of Australians in regional parts of our great country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA>The energy card is a document which has $6 million worth of government funding lying behind it. The intention is to address the problem of greenhouse through the installation of solar hot water services. The point of my question was that over 12 months into the scheme not one single solar hot water service has been put on one single house in Australia. The gist of the minister's reply to my question was that the scheme was all ready to go and the two private companies that were providing the backup money, to which the $6 million was seed money, had a change of management at the last minute and backed away from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Collins began his remarks by pointing to the observation by the IPCC that the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions will not be fully felt for several centuries. That is perfectly true, but I believe that it is rather dangerous for the minister, and through the minister, the government, to put that sort of information on the table in the way in which the minister did because it seems to imply&mdash;and I think it was the minister's intention to imply&mdash;that therefore we could ignore an attack on greenhouse for another number of decades or perhaps centuries. But, as the IPCC itself points out, while the consequences of greenhouse may be many centuries in arriving, there is such a momentum in this process that we need to address it very quickly to turn it around so that those consequences&mdash;decades or centuries in the future&mdash;will be less than they would otherwise be. We certainly do not know what those consequences as yet will be. It is for that reason also that we need to be rather cautious about the way we approach this matter and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The energy card and the delay which has accompanied any spending of that $6 million is not unique. When we negotiated with the government for the ethanol bounty scheme, ethanol to be used in transport fuels, also as a measure to address greenhouse, accompanying that was $4 million which was going into research funding. I learnt just this morning that well over 12 months down the track the government has spent $200,000 out of that $4 million doing studies to find out how to spend the money and that not one dollar of that money has found its way into actual research work which will address the serious problem of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport area, an area from where a large amount of Australia's greenhouse gases come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while the government is prepared to move ahead speedily in many other areas, it is tardy in this important greenhouse area. We have seen, for instance, that the government is prepared to move on the national electricity grid, but nowhere at all has it imposed on the state electricity utilities, or the private companies which are superseding them, the requirement that energy efficiency should be one of their criteria. The problem with state electricity utilities for many years has been that they have been charged with the supply of electricity. The simple manoeuvre necessary is to ensure that they no longer be electricity suppliers but the suppliers of end-use energy services at least cost. If that were done, and that is what has happened with some of the American utilities, it would be cheaper for the electricity utilities to supply solar hot water services rather than continue to try&mdash;as we have seen recently with ETSA in South Australia, with the electricity supply authority here in Canberra and with the electricity utilities in New South Wales&mdash;to sell more and more electricity competitively rather than supply the service of hot water through the least cost mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government, as it has done in the forestry industry, can exercise control through export and import controls. One thing which the federal government could easily have done is say to the utilities that they cannot import any more heavy generating electricity equipment until such a change is made. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I want to mention is that on 7 February the Senate passed a motion calling upon the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to table a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Funding Arrangements for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority</EMPHASIS>. That has been tabled in accordance with the Senate's return to order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second document which the Senate sought to have tabled was the independent external review of environmental management charges which, according to page 30 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park annual report, was due to be completed on 31 December 1994. Senator Faulkner said something about that. I must confess that I did not quite hear him as there were people speaking around me. He indicated, I think, that there was a draft report, that it had not been reviewed by the department but it would be tabled as soon as the department had reviewed it. I am not quite sure why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously if the document is not here it cannot be tabled, but I point out that the annual report of the authority indicated that it would be completed by 31 December 1994. It states `with a public document outlining the findings and recommendations to be published in the new year'. I am concerned that these arrangements are set out in the annual report and, in many instances, do not seem to have been complied with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I guess I can do nothing more than indicate that I require to see that report as soon as possible. It is a matter that is of great interest to the people of North and Far North Queensland and to all those interested in the Great Barrier Reef, and it should be made available as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that has been tabled contains some recommendations that are of major impact to users of the Great Barrier Reef. It indicates that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority needs more money, and I think that has been conceded for a long time. Unfortunately, the government chooses to starve the authority of funds when it is an authority that does a great job and should be properly and adequately funded from existing revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the authority does not have funds, there have been these investigations into future funding arrangements. I notice that at page 29 the report indicates that the steering committee identified a number of initiatives the authority could pursue to improve its revenue stream by either extending its current charging regime or introducing new charges. It then indicates that the steering committee is looking at a marine park charge and goes on to explain that it is canvassing charging for resource rents as a source of revenue. To do that, it anticipates that it may obtain an income of some $3 million per annum. It will, I am sure, send shudders through the tourism industry in Far North Queensland if a resource rent is to be charged for activities that involve using the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to talk about the current environmental management charge which commercial users of the reef already pay, and for that there is quite a deal of income coming in. The report has indicated that for a $1 increase in the charge it would receive $1.4 million per annum, and the steering committee goes on to say that there would be great concern from commercial users of the Great Barrier Reef if this charge were imposed. From the short time I have had to look at this report, the committee seems to shy away from the charge and then states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of these concerns, any decision to increase the environmental management charge would need to be a Commonwealth Government decision, not one taken by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>So this report is again throwing the responsibility onto Senator Faulkner's department to make a decision. Without having referred this to the people who use the reef, I am quite confident that I can say on their behalf that there should not be any increase which would simply be another tax on tourism in Far North Queensland. I imagine the tourist operators and the users of the Great Barrier Reef will fight that all the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report then goes on to talk about a new environmental management charge. It suggests that there should be a new charge that is an extension of the environmental charge. That is not for just commercial operators, as is now the case; it is recommended that it be extended to recreational users and shipping. The report identifies that, for the 24,000 private boat registrations using the Great Barrier Reef, at a charge of $10 per annum the extension of this environmental charge would raise $240,000. Of this, 25 per cent apparently would go into administration, leaving $180,000. The report indicates that shipping would gain another $200,000 based on $100 per trip. The report says it is not recommending $10 per annum or $100 per trip for shipping; it is just using those figures to indicate what would be raised from those sorts of amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report further indicates that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority needs something like $2 million to continue operating. If you are going to get that from the recreational users, that $10 per annum, which would return $180,000 per annum, would have to be increased to something like many hundreds of dollars. That is of great concern to private boat owners and recreational boat owners in the Great Barrier Reef. Whilst I have only just received this report and have not had time to even get a copy of it from the Table Office, I raise this matter at this stage because it is a matter which will be of major concern&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to the recommendations. This report will be of major concern to recreational boat users. I should say in fairness that the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage has indicated in this report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conclusions and subsequent recommendations in this section of the report on revenue options have not been endorsed by the representative on the steering committee from the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not notice any similar reservation by the Commonwealth's representatives. As I say, the conclusions to those recommendations mention that the committee had a dispute as to revenue options. The report goes on to indicate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Finance Steering Committee representatives concluded that, as the environmental management charges at a minimum level, there is a particular merit in exploring scope to increase this charge.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the Commonwealth representative is saying that not much is being paid now so there is a lot of scope to increase this charge. I view this with some concern, as I am sure the tourist operators, commercial boat operators and particularly recreational boat users in Central, North and Far North Queensland will also have concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that my undertaking of 10 to 15 minutes has almost elapsed, so I will not breach that by continuing. Suffice it to say that I will be studying very closely the recommendations of this report. I am anxiously awaiting the Stanley report, which, according to this report, has more specific recommendations. I suspect those recommendations will include a recommendation for an annual charge of something like $50 per annum for private boat users. Perhaps that is the reason why there is some reticence to table that report at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government were to charge private boat users $50 per annum on top of the fuel tax of 33c a litre on outboard fuel that they already pay to the federal government and on top of the registration charge that they already pay to the Queensland government, it would just slug private boat owners in the northern waters and would be a great impediment to tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister: if you are wanting more money for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;and it needs it&mdash;then you should get it out of the fuel tax revenue. Private boat owners pay 33c a litre on the fuel they use. None of that 33c a litre, which is supposed to be for road constructions, is paid back to the boat owners because there are no roads on the Great Barrier Reef. The Commonwealth just gets a skinner. You charge boat owners 33c a litre in fuel tax to fix the roads, but they do not use roads; they use the sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want some money to properly fund the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which you need to do, then you should get it out of your existing revenue in fuel excise tax, which is $10 million; I think that is the figure you rip off motorists. A lot of that comes from boaties, and they get nothing back for it at all&mdash;not a cent. If you want more money for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;and it is needed&mdash;then take it out of the fuel tax revenue. Don't go slugging tourist operators; don't go slugging commercial boat operators; and, in particular, don't go slugging private boat owners, recreational boat users, with another tax. </PARA>

I have not considered the recommendations. I made that very clear. Clearly, I have made no decisions on the matters contained in the report. Let the record be very clear on that matter.

As I said, it was unfortunate that Senator Macdonald did not hear me make that comment when I tabled the return to order a little earlier in the afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the independent external review of environmental management charge, which was due to be completed on 31 December 1994, again it is a pity that my comments were not taken account of. We would have been saved from your speech, Senator Macdonald. I said that the report has been provided to the staff of the authority. I made that very clear. You may have indicated&mdash;I did not quite catch your reference&mdash;that you had a draft copy of such a report. That is quite possible. I do not know whether that was the report that you were referring to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I made&mdash;I will repeat it again so we do not raise the level of paranoia in Senator Macdonald&mdash;was that the report has been provided to authority staff but the authority board has not yet had a chance to consider whether it adequately meets the terms of reference that were established and, therefore, has not had an opportunity&mdash;</PARA>

All that was explained to the Senate when I responded to the order of the Senate that was agreed to on 7 February.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, under the Bill they will be subject to the same tenure provisions (a maximum appointment of 5 years with a total period of appointment of no more than 7 years) as other members of the Boards. This is in contrast with the potentially open-ended reappointment arrangements under the existing legislative provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Chief Censor and Deputy Chief Censor also have a senior executive policy and managerial role in relation to the Office of Film and Literature Classification, its personnel and its work. This is in addition to their normal classification functions and responsibilities for managing the work of the Board and for community consultation. These responsibilities will continue under the structure to be established by the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows from this that in the selection of appointees to fill the position of Director and Deputy Director regard would be had not only to their suitability as representatives of the community in performing classification functions and as representing the public face of the Board but also to their managerial experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Government's view the structure provided in the Bill is the most desirable model. The Office of Film and Literature Classification is a small office (there are only 24 public servants employed in the Office) and it is quite appropriate and cost effective for the Chief Censor to also be the Chief Executive Officer of the Office. I note that this structure is consistent with other statutory bodies which have, in recent years, been given greater autonomy, for example, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>Finally, by way of clarification, I note that the Committee in discussing this recommendation in its October 1993 Report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Video and Computer Games and Classification Issues</EMPHASIS> refers to `[t]he situation of the three senior career public servants of the OFLC being the senior members of the Film Censorship Board . . . ' (para 3.62).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mention that it has not been the general practice in the past to appoint public servants to the statutory positions referred to. Of the incumbents of those positions at the time of the 1993 Report only the Chief Censor was drawn from the public service. Further, the statutory appointees to the Board hold no concurrent public service positions in the OFLC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations 2(vii): The Committee also recommends that a community committee be established, representing major interest groups such as parents, teachers, churches, academics, women, youth, aboriginal and ethnic representatives;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's proposal seeks, in effect, to place a `community committee' between the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board in respect of certain decisions relating to restricted material and between the Classification Review Board and the Attorney-General in respect of certain other decisions also involving restricted material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first problem with this proposal is that it is directed solely to material in the restricted classification categories whereas some of the most difficult classification decisions are in relation to the borderline of the `G' and `PG' categories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it would be unfortunate if an additional, and potentially cumbersome and costly structure were to put in place merely to safeguard against the possibility that the classification of a contentious film may be unacceptable to some sections of the community. There is ample evidence available to indicate that the Government's intention is that both Boards should be representative of the community and, after extensive consultation with the States and Territories, provisions have been added to the Bill to ensure that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of censorship matters it has often been stated that every individual has a view, and that those views may be diverse. Accordingly, it is a significant achievement that the majority of the community appears to support the classification process and to rely upon the decisions that result. (eg, in the 1992 joint ABT/OFLC research project 70% of respondents with dependant children used the classification system; in the 1994 Australian Bureau of Statistics survey commissioned by the OFLC it was found that 90% of households with children 12 years and under were involved in their children's choice of films; it was also found that adults living in families with children 12 years or under were more aware of the classification system than adults in other households.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the Attorney-General's role to comment on particular classification decisions made by independent Boards established for this purpose. However, it is appropriate to observe in the context of this recommendation that the particular decision that concerned the Committee in its October 1993 Report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Video and Computer Games and Classification Issues</EMPHASIS> was made not by the Censorship Board but by the Film and Literature Board of Review as then constituted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although raised in a different context, the question of greater community involvement in classification decisions has already been addressed by my Department in some detail in an earlier submission to the Committee on the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the issues are similar and they are repeated here in response to this particular recommendation with some supplementary comments from a Ministerial perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislation provides for Censorship Board decisions on the merits and, on appeal, a review on the merits by the Board of Review. Review on questions of law goes to the Federal Court or the High Court. A similar structure is found in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A primary decision on the merits with full merits review on appeal is the standard Commonwealth structure for administrative decisions. As the ALRC in its Report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Censorship Procedure</EMPHASIS> noted, where it differs from other reviews of administrative decisions is that it is not a review of an administrator's decision by an independent body but the reconsideration of a decision of one independent body by another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This difference means that the current decision making process can potentially involve up to 21 individual decision makers (15 on the Censorship Board and 6 on the Board of Review) who can, in appropriate cases, reach the decision by a majority vote. Under the Bill the potential numbers are 20 on the Classification Board and 10 on the Classification Review Board. This gives the opportunity for a very wide diversity of views to be brought to bear in the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed community committee would probably add at least a further 10 views to the process if the range of interest groups to be satisfied is taken into account. No doubt the views of this group will be just as divergent as can be the case with the members of the two current Boards and the new Boards. The wide diversity of views that exist within the community are reflected in the results of the on-going public consultation process referred to below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite apart from the undesirability of the Attorney-General having to make classification decisions in the manner proposed in the recommendation, questions relating to whether Board decisions reflect community attitudes, as my Department has previously indicated, are best addressed by ensuring that the Boards:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)truly represents a cross section of the community; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)remain abreast of community attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The representative nature of the Boards is being addressed by the new process of consultation with State and Territory Ministers and the requirement to look at the representative nature of proposed appointments, both of which are now reflected legislatively in the Bill (cl. 48 and 74). You may be assured that this aspect is treated seriously by myself and my State and Territory colleagues. This is reflected in the recent appointments that have been made to the Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, appointments to the current Censorship Board follow public advertisements, interviews and recommendations on the basis of merit. Of recent times there has also been a State and Territory representative on the interviewing panel. This will continue with the new Classification Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to keeping abreast of community attitudes, the ALRC's recommendation for an on-going public consultation program has already commenced. This consultation process takes the form of special screenings of classified, but as yet unreleased, films to groups of people assembled by a market research recruitment agency. An independent market research consultant supervises the completion of a questionnaire and leads a discussion aimed at comparing the issues of concern, the range of intensity of concern about those issues, the recommended age, and appropriate consumer advice with those considered by the Censorship Board when making the classification decision. The results are made available to Board members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on Films, Videos and Computer Games commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) has been completed and copies have been provided to the Committee. Further surveys and research flowing from the results of that survey are planned or underway. These include another joint exercise with the OFLC and the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the above I do not consider the proposal put forward by the Committee to be justified in the current circumstances. The perceived dissatisfaction with certain classification decisions should be addressed by examining any deficiencies in the current decision making process and taking steps to rectify any problems that are found and not by seeking to impose another potentially unwieldy structure on top of the structure that already exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee may be assured, however, that I will be closely monitoring the operation and performance of the two new Boards, in conjunction with my State and Territory colleagues.</PARA>

In studying this topic I want to make a distinction which is not often made but which ought to be made between hardcore pornography and erotica.

<PARA>I rise to speak on the Auditor-General's report No. 19 of 1994-95, an efficiency audit of the validation of nursing home funding by the Department of Human Services and Health. It is very fitting that we take note of the Auditor-General's report on this matter because it was an earlier efficiency audit into the nursing home payment system which highlighted some of the systematic problems in the validation process which finally prompted the government to apply the necessary resources to attempt to complete validations in a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office has again confirmed what we have known for some time. I have spoken about this issue many times in this chamber and I have asked numerous questions in estimates committees. In non-sitting weeks I go to nursing home after nursing home, unlike Senator Crowley who came into this chamber some weeks ago and said, `I visit nursing homes for openings.' I presume that is the only time she ever visits a nursing home. I visit nursing homes more often than just for openings. If you go around and consult with the industry, you find out the problems. The problem that kept occurring over and over again was the problem of validation. I asked numerous questions. We moved a motion in this chamber for an inquiry to be held into validations, which was done, and there has been a report tabled in the Senate on that issue. The Auditor-General has also seen fit to examine it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are significant concerns in the report about the department's administration of its validation program. They reflect concerns that have also been expressed by the voluntary and private sectors of the nursing home industry. The fact is that the government has been made aware time and time again that its validation process for nursing home funding is untimely and has caused significant problems to nursing homes throughout Australia; yet it has sat on its hands. The Department of Human Services and Health has been repeatedly criticised for delays in the validation process; yet, even after the department realised there was a need to speed up the validation of 1986-87 data in 1990, it took another four years before the process was completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nursing home records for 1986-87 are being looked at and it is being determined as to whether money which was allocated to be spent on nursing home duties and nursing home services to residents was in fact spent on SAM, or service component services delivered to residents, which attracts a smaller amount of money from the Commonwealth. So if a nursing home has inappropriately said that a nurse was carrying out a nursing duty when she was carrying out a SAM duty, then the Commonwealth claws back the money that has been inappropriately given to the nursing home for that service. Here we have nursing homes having to go back through their 1986-87 records years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem that has been associated with the validations is that even if the visits for the financial year 1986-87 were completed by the middle of last year there are some nursing homes that have not had exit interviews and in many more cases the validation has not been completed. I have not had time to have a check because we only got the report at 1 o'clock, but from memory&mdash;and I stand to be corrected on this&mdash;I was told in estimates hearings by the department that all validations had been completed. It may be that all validations for 1986-87 have been completed in the sense that the nursing homes have been visited, but they have not been completed if the exit interviews have not been done and the nursing homes have not been told whether they owe money or whether they are not in debt to the Commonwealth for money inappropriately allocated to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems also associated with this is that, because the department was so slow in organising the validations, many nursing homes were repeating the same mistake year after year. None of us in this chamber would accept or condone fraud against the Commonwealth, and we know some nursing homes have not carried out their duties and responsibilities in terms of accountability for public money in the way that we would expect. But because the department changed the goal posts, because the guidelines on what constituted a nursing duty versus a SAM type duty were not clear, many nursing homes made genuine errors and, because the validations have not been completed, they repeated those errors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But who suffers in the end because the department is slow, because money that has been inappropriately allocated to a nursing home has not gone back into the Commonwealth coffers? The real losers, again, are the people in nursing homes. If the department is slow in the validation process and tells a nursing home it owes $40,000 or $50,000 three, four or five years down the track, that money is taken out of that nursing home's allocation for the future. So that means the current people in nursing homes pay the price for an error that the nursing home proprietors may have made many years before. The final crunch is that those residents&mdash;the frail, the vulnerable in our community&mdash;suffer. So we should not tolerate undue delays in the validation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the delays in the validation process, especially in validating 1986-87 data, have had a significant adverse effect on the finances of many nursing homes. The Auditor-General's report found that the present validation program is untimely with at least 169 inspections of nursing home records of expenditure for 1986-87 being undertaken seven years later. That is totally unacceptable for all the reasons I have said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has found that the backlog of validations is larger now than when the validation program started in its present form in 1990. Currently there are 6,600 validations which have been received but not processed. Not all of those are overdue&mdash;and I admit that&mdash;but there is a backlog in about 5,000 cases. As I said, this is a most unacceptable situation, especially when compared to private sector best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that the Auditor-General has outlined is that delays in recoveries are not consistent with good credit management and mean that the real value of money recovered by the Commonwealth has diminished by an estimated $13 million. So what happens if nursing homes owe money to the Commonwealth and that money is not collected? That money could have been used for other purposes, and it has been estimated by ANAO that that constitutes $13 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is debate about this in the report. The department says that the amount lost is only $3 million if you take the CPI as an indicator. Whether you take the CPI or the ANAO as an indicator there is opportunity cost lost because money has not been taken back from nursing homes where there have been genuine errors in accountability between CAM and SAM funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens? Some bureaucrat or the government might sit there and say, `Well, $13 million here, $13 million there; what does it matter?' That $13 million would at least contribute to the issue that Professor Gregory raised about the decline in capital stock that is occurring in nursing homes and hostels because this government has not addressed the funding requirements of nursing homes and hostels, especially upgrading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many nursing homes would look at the $13 million and say, `We could have upgraded to meet the standards we expect to care for our elderly people.' But because the government has been tardy that is the opportunity cost forgone. Who suffers? Again, the frail aged because that money is not being used for them in an appropriate way. It could be redirected back into nursing homes, especially back into capital upgrading which, as I said, Professor Gregory has said is in a parlous state. Also the ANAO office claims there is an estimated $45 million in recoveries which has yet to be identified. Again, this represents a significant cost to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO has recommended that validation inspections be completed within 12 months of the end of the financial year and that the department should adopt a set of procedures which would enable this goal to be accomplished. The department has not accepted this recommendation as being cost-effective or practical. The ANAO has also recommended that all other departmental processes relating to validation should be completed one year later. The department has accepted this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's office has also suggested a program for the department to get up to date. It has suggested a risk management strategy be put in place to get from a situation where there are 6,600 validations to be completed to a situation where validations are completed within two years of the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns that have been raised in the validation report presented to the Senate by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and also the Auditor-General's report are not new, as I said before. The nursing home industry has been struggling under the uncertainty and financial difficulties caused by the department's tardiness for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the obvious difficulties of not knowing whether there will be a negative loading on nursing homes&mdash;in other words, you could go along and suddenly find that you are up for $40,000 or $50,000&mdash;long delays in the validation process have meant that nursing homes are very uncertain about their future and their future planning. That is not appropriate, as I said. The people who suffer in the end are inevitably the older Australians in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO concluded that the current process is unnecessarily inefficient and complex for the industry. The ANAO especially commented on the appeals process which needs to be made more realistic and open and it also highlighted the compelling need for validations to be completed within the shortest possible time&mdash;as I said, two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's office points out that 190 circulars have been sent out to nursing homes since 1986, and if any of you have received one of those you will know that some of them are quite complicated and detailed. The audit office also pointed out that those circulars are not compiled into a directory or a loose-leaf book so that a new nursing home proprietor who is busily involved with the care of their residents is not trying to struggle through some circulars she or he might have filed some time ago. The department ought to provide them in a way so that people can access that information quickly and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the government has been made aware time and time again that its validation process for nursing home funding is untimely and causes significant problems to nursing homes throughout Australia, but it has consistently failed to solve those problems. This Auditor-General's report is yet another example of this failure. The fact that the backlog of validations is larger now than when the validation program started in its present form confirms this. I hope this report will provoke the government into action which will produce results and stop the uncertainty of funding for nursing homes and make them better places for our frail older Australians. </PARA>

It has actually outlined many of the issues that need to be taken into consideration when one is running a risk management program.

There are 24 recommendations in this report, of which the department has accepted 23. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing to note is that the Auditor-General states a very clear case for why we need to have validations and states that validations in this industry are necessary. I find that very reassuring because we are spending a significant amount of government money in this area. One of the reasons the audit office says we need to get up to speed rather quickly is that, from its estimate, there is another $45 million in recoveries which have not yet been identified. That is not an insignificant amount of taxpayers' money that should be back in other taxpayer-funded programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have read of this report I find very interesting. It has suggested a detailed program which would enable performance standards to be met by June 1999 with the aid of a risk management strategy. It has also suggested a list of the possible risk factors to assist the department. It has suggested that the case management approach be adopted, something the department itself had done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has also outlined an appeals mechanism very clearly and very well. One of the issues that kept being raised with the committee when people appeared before it was that they were not necessarily happy with the appeals mechanisms. The ANAO has actually come up with very clear and concise appeals mechanisms. I think these things are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also listed what other information might be required to manage the program. It is obtained on an `as required' basis so the program is managed with a lower than desirable level of information. The information system is not, but should be, the by-product of information used to support routine activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO has provided details in this report which it believes are necessary to manage the validation program and has suggested that the system be incorporated into the financial system that provides recurrent funding to nursing homes. For those people who do not have a great deal of time to read ANAO reports, I suggest they read the summary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I raise is the final recommendation, which I think has some very significant ramifications for the industry if the industry wants to look at it. It is certainly one way to overcome the problem of having to validate money it has already received. The ANAO recommended that the department examine the possibility of funding arrangements being less conducive to fraud by making the OCRE and CAM payments in arrears, possibly after a phasing-in period. The department will consider this response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this report provides for the industry some fairly clear guidelines as to what the department, if it agrees, will certainly be thinking. It also provides some insight and some information as to how the department can go about looking further at and streamlining the validation process. Nowhere in this document does it say that validation should not occur. I think that is a very important point for people to realise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this report forms a very valuable adjunct to our first report. It will also form a very important part of the work the ombudsman is doing on those cases where people are having problems and are not happy with the appeals mechanism. In here is an appeals mechanism set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this will be, in the long term, one of the more significant ANAO reports because it does offer a way, a future and some guidelines as to how problems that have been identified, not just by the ANAO but by the department itself, can be overcome. </PARA>

All senators are aware by now of the advice the Liberal Party is receiving from its chief source of advice, the so-called Republic Advertising company.

<PARA>I will tell you who and why they might be in future. The `who' is those who claim falsely to be in de facto relationships to escape the parental means test on Austudy, and the `why' is because Senator Hill and the Liberal Party want to let them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party wants to pay lip-service to the story that undeserving people are receiving government support. The Liberal Party wants to make that a major thrust of its political platform, but the actions of the opposition here, in particular, give lie to what the Liberal Party would say. What you are arguing for here could create a whole class of such people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, a student qualified as independent for Austudy purposes if he or she had been legally married. A de facto relationship was not a ground for independent status. The policy rationale for non-recognition of de facto marriages was that this minimised the scope for students to evade the parental means test by declaiming a de facto relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the passage of the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act in 1984, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of marital status, these arrangements only continued under an exemption clause or clauses. The last of these expired in mid-1994, but a further six-month extension was obtained to enable the government to implement the change on a whole year basis. The changes to the Austudy regulations made in Statutory Rules 1994 No. 409 from 1 January 1995 state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Marriage has been removed as a criterion for independence; the definition of spouse is non-discriminatory; and income tests are the same for both married and de facto students.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has introduced new rules governing eligibility for Austudy which are non-discriminatory and fair to all students. The system Senator Hill wants to reinstate discriminated directly against single students and students in de facto relationships. The government's new rules give every Austudy applicant the same standing, regardless of marital status, as required by the laws prohibiting discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system that the opposition, supported by the Democrats and the Greens, wants to reinstate means single students under 22, unless they have been working full time for three of the previous four years, were still assessed for Austudy on the basis of their parents' income&mdash;even if they were not living with their parents and their parents were not providing any financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules Senator Hill wants to reinstate&mdash;as if they represented some golden era that the Liberal Party wants to return to&mdash;were inconsistent and discriminatory. I think, under the new leadership of Mr Howard, we want to go back to that dreadful word `incentivation' that occurred in about 1988 and the famous picket fence family that was prominently displayed for a while by Mr Howard, who was the then leader. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that we are now returning, in policy terms, to the Howard view of Australia vis-a-vis the 1950s. It has only been a week and a half since he has returned to the leadership formally, and we are already now seeing the impact of the conservative Howard philosophy towards the way Australia is structured and operates. It is a view of the 1950s which fortunately most Australians do not see as relevant to a progressive and open society of tolerance in this decade and into the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. I have been listening to Senator Schacht. He was trying to put up a reasonable argument before, but under the relevant standing order I do not think where Senator Patterson sits in the chamber has got anything to do with this debate. Where she sits in this chamber has got nothing to do with her ability. I believe you should tell him to get back to the relevance of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator McKiernan)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;The point of order taken by Senator Panizza has got some merit in it. I would, in ruling on the point of order, ask Senator Schacht to address himself to the motion before the chamber. In asking Senator Schacht to do that, I would ask opposition senators, and all senators, to refrain from interjections which would seek to divert the speaker from the subject matter at hand. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President, for your assistance in this matter. As I was saying, the rules Senator Hill wants to reinstate&mdash;as if they represented that return to the golden era&mdash;were inconsistent and discriminatory, even in the way students in de facto relationships were treated. Students living in de facto relationships with high income earners had an unfair advantage over married students because the income of the de facto partner was not taken into account until the relationship had been in place for two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, students in a de facto relationship did not automatically qualify for Austudy at the independent rate. Under the regulations we are proposing, the same requirements apply to all students in a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory way. If these changes to the regulations are disallowed, as is now proposed, the regulations that applied in 1994 remain in force. However, no exemption from the provisions of the discrimination act is now in force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sex Discrimination Commissioner is an independent statutory office holder, and the government cannot oblige this officer to provide a further exemption. In the absence of an exemption, the Austudy regulations would be open to challenge by couples in a de facto relationship seeking independent status in the same way as it applies to married couples. A student could bring a complaint on behalf of all students in de facto relationships and compensation could be ordered by the Human Rights Commission. This could have the same effect as changing the Austudy provisions to allow de facto couples to obtain independent status on the same basis as married students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's move to disallow the regulations will, therefore, have three effects. The government is likely to be obliged to extend independent status which provides exemption from the Austudy parental means test to students in de facto relationships, at an estimated cost of $170 million each year. An opposition that is talking about $5 billion worth of expenditure cuts is blithely proposing a measure that is contrary to the Sex Discrimination Act and that is going to cost an extra $170 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Democrats and the Greens reckon this is probably a pretty good idea, because they are always in favour of endless expenditure. The remarks made earlier in the debate today by Senator Margetts indicated that particularly. But I am very surprised at the hypocrisy of the opposition announcing that they are looking at $5 billion plus in expenditure cuts and then just allowing another $170 million to be added here&mdash;and, of course, not telling where they will make extra cuts to make up for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second effect: that there would be major administrative difficulties in allowing independent status for de facto relationships amongst students because of the ease with which students could falsely represent normal group accommodation living arrangements as de facto relationships, thus circumventing the parental means test. </PARA>

But you know as well as I do&mdash;as do those of us for whom it now is well over 25 years since being university students, as it is with me&mdash;that, in a practical sense, students share houses in numbers that most of us now would find uncomfortable. It would be very easy for those students to promote a case for a de facto relationship and, of course, extra cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there could be a financial inducement to enter de facto relationships for many young people under the age of 22. This is the most astonishing thing of all. Here are those of the Liberal opposition, white picket fence and all, talking about the 1950s moral strait-jacket&mdash;that is the style they are all about&mdash;with the unintended consequence of what they are doing with the disallowance being to encourage students to go into de facto relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that some of the conservative members of the opposition, particularly those in the so-called Lyons group, I think it is called, or Lyons foundation, would be too pleased to see that this is the consequence of the policy that they are now putting up here. I am sure that we await with interest to hear from people like Mr Miles, Senator Herron, Senator Abetz, and those other conservatives of the Lyons foundation, Lyons group or Lyons committee&mdash;whatever it is called&mdash;justifying to that constituency, to which they are forever rabble rousing as being the last defenders of civilisation and family structure, that they will be voting shortly to encourage young people to go into de facto relationships. That is the consequence of trying to be a populist in here, jumping up and down without proper thought for the consequences of your position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to emphasise that, in arguing for a return to the status quo, Senator Hill is arguing for a position which is discriminatory in terms of the act. He would have the government ignore or act counter to the intent of the law. It should be remembered that the Sex Discrimination Act is not an act of this government; it is an act of the parliament. In 1983 members of the Liberal Party were allowed to vote on this legislation according to their consciences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill voted for the legislation. He supported the notion of treating people equally and not discriminating against any person on the basis of marital status. Not only did he vote for it, he took the opportunity to speak in favour of it. He acted on that occasion as a man of principle. But now that he is trapped into being part of the Howard leadership team, he argues for the rejection of the same principle. Further, by arguing that the government should return to the status quo, he argues that this Senate should demand that the government act contrary to the legislation of the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would make one other comment. When Senator Margetts was speaking today in this debate, she wanted the present age of independence for Austudy&mdash;being 22, as I understand it&mdash;to be dropped to the age of 18. DEET estimates that this would just add another $1 billion to the Austudy bill. I know that Senator Margetts will never be in a position to be part of a government which is responsible for the revenues and expenditure in Australia. But I do think that people should not blithely stand up and say, `Do this,' with the consequence of an added $1 billion of expenditure and with their having no idea of whether it is equitable or fair. It would mean that a lot of high income earners would be able to have their kids on Austudy at the taxpayers' expense. Even some of those in the opposition would see that as being a not particularly equitable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also Senator Margetts mentioned the extension of rent assistance to all students. The department advises me that this would add a further $100 million to the outlays. So, again, we just ask that the parliament and the people understand that it is very easy to be a populist, to always stand up and argue that we should spend and spend. But usually the people who put that argument forward really have very few ideas on how we are to raise the revenue, without causing other severe consequences to the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is very firm on this issue. We cannot vote against the principle of the Sex Discrimination Act; we believe that to do so is hypocritical. We are surprised, in particular, that the Democrats&mdash;who have always supported such issues of non-discrimination&mdash;in this case have fallen for the populist three-card trick and are supporting this disallowance. I am not surprised that the Greens are up there being even more populist and demanding expenditures of over an extra $1 billion&mdash;which would be the consequence if they were to get their way on Austudy&mdash;with no thought to the necessary outlays and taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, just to reiterate: the opposition has jumped in on this issue obviously without looking at all the consequences. Now we have a situation where, firstly, they&mdash;particularly Senator Hill&mdash;are voting against the principle of the Sex Discrimination Act that Senator Hill himself strongly supported back in the mid-1980s. He is now voting against the principles of that act in order to continue the discriminatory nature of the arrangements of Austudy with which the government does not want to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and most mockingly of all, opposition senators do not understand the consequences of what they are about. For a party which professes conservative values, a return to the 1950s, the picket fence and the family of mum and dad and the two kids, if this measure is carried, they will actually be encouraging young people to form de facto relationships so they can get the money. It is an extraordinary outcome and it just shows you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this opposition is utterly bereft of any policy substance. </PARA>

I believe that de facto relationships are far more loose than marriage; I certainly hope that marriage is more secure than a de facto relationship.

I will bet my bottom dollar that that is what would happen in the breakdown of a de facto relationship, especially the type of relationship that Senator Schacht described where people go into it for the purpose of qualifying for Austudy. I will quote from a letter that I received from a third year medical student from the University of Western Australia. Her letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the rules for eligibility for Austudy were changed to preclude married students from receiving Austudy as they were considered to be still dependent on their parents for financial support. If you have ever been married, you will understand what a ridiculous rule this is.</PARA>
<PARA>I have been married; I still am married&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A married student is not considered independent until they satisfy another of the independent criteria, none of which is personal or spouse income.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say that her husband would not satisfy the criteria either. A lot of students caught up by these regulations are married to each other. In this case, the wife is in third year medicine and the husband is doing a postgraduate degree. That means that, under the new regulations, he cannot claim Austudy and she cannot claim Austudy. In fact, this couple got married last week. Her parents live in Queensland and they are relying on them. I suppose if the husband is not getting any money, he is relying on his parents as well. It puts them in very awkward situation. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My husband . . . and I do not satisfy any of the other criteria. I am 21 (22 in September) and am studying for a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery Degree. My husband is 23 (24 in April) completing his Master of Engineering, which he will finish in October.</PARA>
<PARA>She looked into the situation and she says in her letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to people at Austudy who have told me my application will be rejected under the new ruling. I have spoken to the Austudy counsellor at UWA . . . who told me my only option&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this; this student is in third year, going into fourth year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was to quit Medicine for the year and go on the dole while looking for work.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of advice you get from Social Security under this government: you have to go on the dole while you are looking for work. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have spoken to . . . at the Department of Social Security to see if there were any other benefits I could receive so I didn't have to quit Medicine. She was very sympathetic&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The only extra advice she was offered was to appeal the decision and be used as a test case. Of course, appealing the decision takes a long time. She was told that it takes up to nine months and in that time she would be lucky to find a part-time job. Bearing in mind how little spare time there is available when you are studying medicine, she could score about $70 a week, and that would be the total taxable income. Finally, she said about the abuse of the system:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondarily, it is offensive to me that the government obviously doesn't consider my marriage to . . . to be legal and honourable.

<PARA>And nor could I&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who would undertake the enormous commitment of marriage for the $120 a week&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That brings me to the point Senator Schacht made that this would force them into de facto relationships. Who would do that for $120 a week? I think the situation is stupid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at de facto relationships, which Senator Schacht said they would be forced into. When you take on a marriage&mdash;and I suppose it is still the case&mdash;you take on obligations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You would have argued last week before you brought down this regulation that that was the situation. You cannot have it both ways. I can also remember the debate on the Sex Discrimination Act. I can remember the arguments that were put that we need to protect married people, particularly married women, from adverse discrimination, which had been the case so often. That is why that type of discrimination was acted upon through legislative means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to be a somewhat distorted argument to now come in here and say that in some way it is prejudicing married people. We are trying to give them the benefits that they traditionally had under the Austudy regulations because society has treated them as independent, their parents treat them as independent and we think they have the right to regard themselves as independent. So I have not found the government's defence of its position at all convincing. Certainly we stand by the case that we have brought against these regulations. If it means that the government has to take some other action as a result of its unsuccessful attempt to, in effect, discriminate against married students then so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the jeering at Senator Panizza's contribution demonstrates a certain prejudice on the other side of the chamber that is unfortunate. Senator Panizza comes here very much driven by a set of traditional values which are still the values of a very sizeable percentage of the Australian community. His attitude to marriage, to married students and to de factos remains a view that is held by a lot of Australians and should be treated with respect rather than with jeers. I am sorry that the government of this country, as represented by the minister and the other few government senators here today, does not see that point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe there is an agreement between the various parties that we are each going to speak for approximately 10 minutes. I say at the outset that most senators would know that the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill was set up by the Senate to undertake a widespread consultation process with Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to determine their views, particularly on the Senate amendments to the legislation and other matters. This was done based on the background of information provided by the government, which had told Australians and Australian Aboriginals in particular that the so-called Land Fund Bill was the product of the most widespread, extensive and exhaustive consultation in the history of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we looked at the list of who the government had consulted with, we found that not only had verbal consultation taken place with literally only a dozen or so people, but of the other 100 people on the mailing list, 20-something were churches and mining and pastoral interests. The rest of the Aboriginals who were supposedly consulted were just sent a copy of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume that we will be debating the issues in this report in a fortnight when we come back. I take this opportunity as chairman to say a few thankyous. The Senate will know that the committee was established late last year and, by agreement, was asked to report by 31 January. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kernot" NAMEID="XW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator Kernot</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What was the real reason for its establishment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the Senate did not want to be seen to be delaying the legislation. Senator Kernot should stop interjecting so that the chairman can thank those people who worked hard on the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Kernot interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously Senator Kernot does not want the committee staff or the Hansard people to be thanked during this debate. Her continuing to interject and make cheap, disgusting political points might be a typical reflection of her views on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will thank the people who assisted us in chronological order. Firstly, I thank Dr Rosemary Laing, who is the Senate Clerk Assistant (Committees). She was given the job in the first instance of trying to get the committee off the ground without any staff. Dr Rosemary Laing and I worked very hard in the first two or three days to put together the information pack, which was most useful for many of the witnesses, staff and senators on the committee in dissecting the complex legislation and the amendments. I thank Dr Rosemary Laing very earnestly for her work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, in chronological order, Sue Morton was very shortly thereafter appointed. I must say that, having working with her over the last couple of months, Sue has made what I have described in the preface to the report as a herculean task seem to go relatively smoothly, if not easily. Again, it is due to Sue's great character and her sense of humour that the committee was able to achieve so much in such a short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank Trish Carling, who I see in the gallery today, for the work she did as the senior research officer to the committee. She was of incredible assistance. The job of recording the names and affiliations of the 244-odd witnesses was at times very hard. In the process of the committee&mdash;I have sworn to the Hansard people that I would not disclose this too widely; I am now going to break my promise&mdash;we introduced a roving microphone, which was used to ensure that anyone in the gathering could have their views heard regardless of whether they put their submission in writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman, I undertook to tell Hansard that I would make sure that no evidence was recorded until we were given the names of the various witnesses and the capacity in which they appeared. In some circumstances, that was quite hard. Trish had to run around and ensure that all of those 244 witnesses had their details recorded. She did that absolutely thoroughly. We went to 11 or 12 locations around Australia and usually spent an entire day at each location. We clearly heard in excess of 20 witnesses at each place. So the committee went through a very physically and mentally gruelling process. It could not have been done without people like Sue and Trish on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Ian Willis was appointed at very short notice. He was seconded from a posting in the ACT government to act as our principal research officer. Ian's background in Aboriginal affairs research was absolutely essential to the committee's success. Within the short time that we were required to report, it was very helpful to have Ian able to form the framework of the report as we went along. So, when we did get back to Canberra last week, the report writing was not as tough as it could have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sheryln Millikin was based in Canberra as ground control while we moved around Australia. She did a fantastic job of keeping the committee in contact with witnesses who were continuing to contact the office as we moved around Australia from place to place. She did a tremendous job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay particular tribute to the Hansard and Sound and Vision Office people, because they are often not thought of in these matters. In this committee it was very important&mdash;I think Senator Chamarette made the point at a press conference this morning&mdash;that, regardless of what happens to this bill once this report is tabled, the historical record now shows the views of 244 witnesses across Australia, most of them Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, on land issues. In particular, the issues these amendments looked at are recorded for all time. So it does not really matter what flavour politicians here in the Senate want to put on the evidence; the evidence is there for people to read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention the people from Hansard and Sound and Vision in no order of merit. I will mention Lisa Barrenger first because she had to lug around all the heavy sound and vision equipment. She and and Peter Zuccato are both from the Sound and Vision Office and Lyn Millar, Val Poon, Ros Paterson and Nari Muscat are from Hansard. I have said in the preface to the report that they played a crucial and, without putting too exaggerated a point on it, historic role in recording the views of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have limited our time necessarily. As chairman, it is most appropriate that I thank those who took part in the hearings. As I said, I will discuss the policy issues at another time. I also thank the senators who did take part in the hearings, particularly Senator Cooney who came to all the hearings, and my colleagues Senator Ellison and Senator Troeth. Senator Troeth came to every hearing, and Senator Ellison came to all the hearings but one, because he had another hearing that day on another committee. Senator Chamarette came to all the hearings. It was very hard work. No-one who was on that committee could say that it was not extremely rewarding to have the opportunity to speak to so many of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters about these issues. It was a very rewarding experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point needs to be made: I hope that the government will take this report genuinely. I can see from Senator Kernot's snide interjections that she will not. I have seen from the minority report some criticisms of the process. Quite frankly, we await what Senator Lees says. I hope that Senator Ellison responds on behalf of the opposition. I have been disgusted by the performance of Senator Lees, particularly, during the past few hours. She has actually misrepresented some facts absolutely and fundamentally. But we can deal with them down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I genuinely call on the government to approach the report positively. The coalition senators and the Greens have compromised where compromise was necessary. We have been prepared to modify and adjust our views and to support those contentions that were supported by the witnesses. I hope that the government will bring the legislation back into this place without delay and allow it to move from the Senate to the House of Representatives, where the government can deal with the issues and at least give some credit to the 244 people who came before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, about 10 or so witnesses said, `Let's put the bill through with no amendments.' Of the balance of the witnesses, some, but not very many, supported all of the amendments; we would not expect that. Some supported some of the amendments and some supported only one or two. The reality is that over 200 of the 244 witnesses said that the bill does need some sort of amendment. I ask the government to bring the legislation back and to give the report and the witnesses the cognisance they deserve. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (5.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the land fund bill majority and minority reports, I take this opportunity to endorse the remarks of Senator Campbell in thanking the staff and Hansard. I think the logistics of organising this committee in January was extremely difficult and I give every praise to the staff involved, Hansard and, of course, the chair and colleagues. We do disagree in our interpretation and, while it was a useful exercise to attend the hearings that I attended, it is always good to hear further views. I feel that my position in relation to the amendments is pretty much as it was at the end of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference required the committee to inquire into whether the amendments improved the bill and to seek a level of consensus on the amendments among the indigenous people of Australia. The Senate committee found that there were nine groups of amendments which aroused the most comment during the hearings we conducted. It is the conclusion of the minority report, signed by Senator Lees and me, that these groups of amendments should be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In hearing evidence on these crucial groups of amendments, the committee found that there was no agreement among indigenous people on whether the amendments should be retained or deleted. I suppose we should not really be surprised about this because obviously there is going to be a diversity of opinions in the indigenous community just as there is in the rest of the community. Obviously this is the result of a very considerable variation in the circumstances and needs among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. The essential conclusion of our minority report is that the only way for the land fund legislation to adequately cover this considerable variety is for the ILC to have flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hold the view that the coalition and the Greens want to be overprescriptive. I make no comment on their motives in this regard, but they are trying to put everything into the legislation. That will mean there will be less flexibility and it will detract from the opportunity for Aboriginal self-determination and for a flexible approach to what is a very complex issue when you are addressing the extremes of situations that people are in throughout the country. The less prescription and legislative direction in the land fund legislation the more closely we will be able to meet the needs of all indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that the legislation as originally drafted gave much discretion to the indigenous controlled ILC board and anticipated that policy direction would come to the ILC through the regional strategies, drawn up after extensive negotiation and consultation in the regions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the bill undermine this important source of self-management for indigenous people. It is the Senate which purports to give policy direction to the ILC on how to handle a number of sensitive issues, but we cannot even predict many of those sensitive issues because they will arise as the legislation is put into place. I believe that if the amendments were agreed to we would have more litigation, more confusion and certainly a great deal of rivalry and conflict between indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of focus has been put on the government's consultation. I would like to make just a couple of general points about the development of this bill. First of all, the coalition's feigned indignation about the lack of government consultation would seem to me to be pretty hypocritical because we know that the opposition did not consult on the amendments to the bill that it introduced into the House last year because those amendments were still being drafted and circulated on the day that they were introduced. Clearly, if you want consultation you have to practise what you preach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from being hypocritical, it would seem that some of the facts are obviously not recognised. The fact is that the government did not merely consult with indigenous people; it negotiated with them. The first real negotiations in regard to indigenous policy development in this country occurred when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) negotiated with Aboriginal people in the development of the native title legislation. It was a real breakthrough in Australia for indigenous people for the first time to be taken seriously in terms of sitting down and negotiating the best outcome in the development of the native title bill. There was a similar process in regard to the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I accept there were all those groups who came to us and said, `Oh, we were not consulted.' But let us be realistic. We do not expect anywhere else in the general community for everybody to be consulted. We choose groups that broadly represent ATSIC&mdash;obviously, land fund representatives&mdash;we choose people who we can talk to who broadly represent the community. I think it is important that we do not impose double standards here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time remaining to me I will look at some of the amendments. I would like to address specifically some of the conclusions reached in the majority report. The `most severely dispossessed' amendment was the most roundly trashed of all the coalition-Green amendments. Witnesses at the hearings consistently said, `We are all dispossessed. We do not want degrees of dispossession. We do not want to try to argue, especially as it would result in legalistic argument and potential litigation, about who is more or less dispossessed'. All Australian indigenous peoples have been dispossessed. That is a historic fact. To try to talk about who is more or less disadvantaged will only exacerbate the divisions that already exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition and the Greens had to recognise this and a revised wording is proposed in the majority report to incorporate the principle that `those who suffer most disadvantage in access to land receive priority'. This wording might be an acknowledgment of the views expressed, and we have to recognise that, but is access to be defined in a formal institutional sense? If so, the Aboriginal people of New South Wales will go to the bottom of the list because their state has a land rights act and a land acquisition fund. Is that the intention of the coalition and the Greens or is it to be defined in a direct physical sense? If that is the case, those people who retain cultural links through proximity to their country but who do not own their land will be unfairly excluded despite the urgency of the need to re-establish connections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these points not just to be in disagreement but to highlight the complexity of senators making these decisions now when we are preparing the way for a land fund to be presented and put in place so that the flexibility, the whole variety of circumstances that will come forth in the coming years, can be adequately accommodated. If we are overly prescriptive the land fund will not be able to be implemented in a way that genuinely recognises self-determination among indigenous people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take only a couple of minutes of the Senate's time to briefly indicate the government's reaction to this report. I want to say at the outset that the committee did conduct a gruelling schedule of hearings around the country which did give many people the opportunity to comment on the amendments. The committee did well to produce its report only a few days after it was due. To that extent, we are indebted to members of the committee for the exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, it appears that the disagreements that were all so evident when we were debating the substance of the bill have really, at the end of the day, simply been paraded once again. It is not at all evident, despite all the hard work that has gone into this report, how much really substantial has been accomplished, either in terms of exposing new issues that we had not previously thought of or in terms of bringing about a genuine reconciliation of competing views and attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, the government's reaction to all this is essentially this: it still firmly believes that the faults it identified in the legislation&mdash;the most important of them I described as the `seven deadly sins'&mdash;still remain. Although some effort has been made in the majority report to identify a slightly softened position so far as at least a couple of those amendment areas are concerned, I remain, as presently advised, unpersuaded that that has done enough to lead the government to change its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take a final view on this issue. The government does not want to do so just yet so far as every single one of these amendments or so far as the drafting implications are concerned. What I do state, however, very firmly for the record is that, in relation to those matters that we identified previously as having either fundamental defects in principle or as, in our judgment, making the bill unworkable, the government is highly unlikely to change its mind. The particular areas that we adopt that attitude in relation to are certainly where there is the reference to those most severely dispossessed. It may be that some improved formula can be found for that, but nonetheless there is still a severe operational difficulty involved, as we see it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not talking about the particular language but to the extent that people are still to be prioritised by reference to their access to land or anything else creates a particular problem. That is one of the areas. I mentioned it first because it was first on the list as we reached these issues last time. It still remains a problem for us, as we see it&mdash;not so much in principle; it never was a problem in principle. It is less of a problem in principle now with the proposed reworking, but it is certainly a fundamental practical problem, as I am presently advised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of grants to individuals involves fundamental questions of principle in so far as to do that would be contrary to indigenous land-holding practices and what we are trying to achieve with the spirit of the bill. The question of the reference to health, housing and so on as things to be taken into account also involves problems of principle for us in so far as the land fund is to meet land needs, as we have constantly argued. We do not see that there is virtue in introducing additional considerations into that calculation of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement in the present amendment that the ILC not have to consent to the sale of land is, we think, offensive in principle as it inhibits the capacity of land staying in Aboriginal hands, which is the fundamental purpose of the bill. The question as to the consultation with traditional owners, even if the terminology is changed a bit, still brings about, on the face of it, some fundamental operational difficulties in making the act work effectively in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement for there to be consultation on the regional and national strategies and so on, including with states, creates, as we see it and continue to see it, operational problems.

At this stage, as presently advised&mdash;I qualified all of my remarks on that basis&mdash;I do not see that there will be any fundamental shift in the government's position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am fascinated by what you had to say, Senator Campbell, this morning on public radio. I do not know whether what you said represents a personal view or a view of the opposition or what it in fact signifies so far as your attitude to the bill is concerned if it is amended again or comes back to you from the House of Representatives in the original form that we wanted in relation to these particular issues. We will find out, I guess, in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am saying is that, on particular substantive issues&mdash;and indeed one or two others as well, like the representation of ATSIC commissioners and so on&mdash;subject to further consideration of some matters of detail, the government, as presently advised, has not changed its mind as a result of the committee's work. If that all means that the committee's report has been a bit of a waste of time, that is no more than we said was likely to be the case anyway when you embarked upon this particular frolic. So be it and you cannot complain about getting that attitude now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do hope&mdash;this is the final point I want to make&mdash;that we can approach this issue in a way that does focus on the main game, and that is the necessity to get in place as soon as possible a land fund which will genuinely meet the aspirations and needs of the Aboriginal people. That is the political imperative&mdash;not any particular partisan posturing or manoeuvring. The imperative is to do a decent job for the Aboriginal people, to follow up and to put in place a corollary to the Mabo principles that we have accepted&mdash;the Mabo legislation&mdash;which will in fact mean that we can address another dimension of this whole fundamental problem of Aboriginal need. On that basis, I have nothing more to say at this stage, but no doubt I will have plenty more to say at a later stage of these proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not a great deal of time is available today to discuss the substantive amendments, so I do not propose to do that. But I would like to comment on several other matters addressed in the report. These two matters are the level of consultation which was embarked on both by us and by the government in its presentation of this legislation and also the role that ATSIC has played in this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in our journey around Australia I was amazed at the level of interest in the amendments among the Aboriginal community and the fact that many people made extremely lengthy journeys at very short notice in order to present their views to us. When the other members of the committee and I proceeded to ask witnesses when they first heard of the legislation, it was very illuminating to note that nearly all of them thought we meant the committee consultation. The fact that legislation had preceded this and that notice of that legislation had been available since last May or June was unknown to most of them. It was with some amazement that we proceeded to hear this. By contrast, as Senator Campbell has already well documented in other places, government spokesmen such as Senator Gareth Evans have described the consultation over the bill as `very exhaustive', `extensive consultation in relation to this bill' and `wide-ranging consultation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we got to our meeting at Dubbo, we had considerable difficulty in starting the consultation because of the level of anger in the room due to the fact that nobody had known anything about the bill or the amendments until about two days before. Every person in that room who spoke for a group of people spoke out about the fact that they would need a great deal more time to really find out the views of their tribe, their clan or their family. Page 46 of the report sums this up very well; it even considerably understates it. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considerable anger was evident throughout the public hearing in Dubbo over the lack of consultation.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 47 of the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the overwhelming majority of witnesses consulted . . . complained that they had heard little or nothing about the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>It took the committee most of the rest of that day to hear the very angry people who had known little or nothing about the legislation. This was a recurring factor throughout our consultations at Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Broome, Perth and Kalgoorlie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that the legislation was widely circulated and that one of the mediums for this was ATSIC. Let me say at the start that I repudiate totally the charge of ATSIC bashing which has been levelled against my coalition colleagues and the majority reporters. That charge is laid on page 24 of the second minority report. The fact that ATSIC was not able to percolate knowledge of the legislation to the grassroots level of the Aboriginal community indicates to me that ATSIC is not being well served by the government and that it should be given more consultative processes or a greater degree of flexibility in the way that it consults with its own people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the fault of ATSIC personnel that they were not able to consult. In Tasmania, we heard from the ATSIC chief in that state that no consultation whatever had taken place in his organisation throughout Tasmania. You cannot be surprised that there was a considerable level of bewilderment and confusion over what this legislation means. We are not in the process of condemning ATSIC or the personnel involved, but obviously the role that they undertake needs to be looked at in a new light by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were individuals in ATSIC who appeared to take a reasonably lofty view of their role and the way in which people should have heard about this legislation. I instance the view of Darryl Pearce, the Director of the Northern Land Council, who spoke to us in Darwin. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the Aboriginal bureaucracy, if you like, Senator Kernot. I am talking about the level of consultation. Mr Pearce is the Director of the Northern Land Council. What he said does indicate to some extent the point of view of the Aboriginal bureaucracy both in some of the land councils and in ATSIC itself. He goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it our fault that they did not?</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that, if we are going to go through a proper process of consultation, we are never going to get a bill through. No-one expects us, as is quoted in the minority report, to `consult to within an inch of our lives' or words to that effect. But there still must be a level of consultation at which many more of the Aboriginal people know about this legislation than was evident to us. That is something that certainly struck me to a great extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that Senator Cooney, for whom I have the greatest respect and who proved to be excellent company on the consultations, did make a few comments in his report that I could only describe as misguided. He instanced the witnesses not being prepared to discuss the legislation with us. How could the witnesses be prepared if they did not have the faintest knowledge of what they were supposed to be talking about? That was because they had not been told anything and they did not know anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, because ATSIC had been talked to by the government&mdash;it was one of the few groups who had&mdash;it did have a greater consultation. Page 180 of the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its evidence appeared to be based on a more measured consideration of and a greater consultation about the legislation than that of any other group.</PARA>
<PARA>At the Dubbo hearing, Mr Delaney, the Chairperson of the Sydney Regional Council of ATSIC, referred to the level of consultation. On page 180 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . from my understanding the consultation processes were carried out with the Kimberley Land Council, the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council and the top end mob&mdash;the Cape York Land Council. NSWALC, to an extent, was included. Those were the consultations.</PARA>
<PARA>At that rate, it is no wonder that many of the people we spoke to did not have any idea. My whole point is that the consultation was carried out with only the upper echelons of both the land councils and the ATSIC organisation. On page 194 of the report and on page 2 of the minority report, there is a suggestion that the coalition believes that organisations should be unanimous behind every detail of the land fund legislation. As Senator Campbell suggested in public this morning, we do not believe, nor would we ever expect, that there would be unanimity. What we are looking for is a point of view. It is obvious that every Aboriginal person in Australia will not feel the same about this legislation. We were not after unanimity. We were simply after a point of view, and that was certainly provided to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to use the time of the Senate at the moment, but I will certainly be making further comment on the amendments themselves when they are debated in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that I am using only five minutes of the Democrats' time. One issue that really does concern me is that of consultation, which was the whole reason for this committee. Consultation really did break down at the very end when the members of the committee were supposedly consulting with each other to determine where we were going on the report. For the first time ever in my five years in this place, not only was the draft report finished before any consultation had taken place with those members who did not support the majority but also the recommendations were included. I found that very difficult, particularly as the meetings were set up at a time when I simply was not able to get there and had no say as to when those meetings were set.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to look at the bulk of the problem. If one thing is evident, it is that agreement was not reached on everything. We had views ranging from almost unanimous support for the position the Greens and the Liberal Party had adopted, right through to the point where ATSIC was adopting the recommendations of the government. As we have already heard from Senator Reynolds, ATSIC helped to draw up those recommendations. However, I believe we also have to give considerable weight to the views between these two, from the bulk of the larger organisations which, as you will see in the minority report, we have accepted as representing large numbers of Aboriginal people. While there were groups of people who certainly supported particular amendments, you cannot then extrapolate that to mean that they supported the bulk or all of the amendments, which is the way we have ended up balancing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we did have a few people who were supportive of linking health, housing and education into the land fund, there were others who did not, although they did acknowledge the fact that health, housing and education are critical issues for Aboriginal people. You cannot then extrapolate that principle and say, `Okay, they also support the linking of those issues back into the land fund.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had great difficulty with the majority report. It acknowledged the fact that there is a great need in those areas in the community and that they are very important issues, but has tied them back again to land. If there was anything that virtually everybody agreed to, it was that an extra $3 million was required; yet the majority report states, `However, the committee does not recommend pressing the request.' In other words, the majority has decided not to press ahead with the one thing the bulk of Aboriginal people agreed to&mdash;that $3 million should go to the land fund as an administrative expense. The one thing that virtually everybody disagreed with&mdash;that the states not be involved&mdash;has remained in the report. I find that really amazing. I had hoped that, with consultation before that draft report was put together, we could have had a consensus on maybe a few things, but I do not believe the opportunity was really there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most disappointing thing in all of this is that, after all that consultation, I do not believe either the opposition or the Greens really understand the urgent need for Aboriginal people to be given the opportunity to own land. I know there has been a lot of rhetoric, but we have a situation where, if we go ahead with these amendments, we will set up a land fund with so many strings attached that it will be susceptible not only to misinterpretation but also to endless legal challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It simply is not good enough for the chair of the committee to say, `We're working on a principle here.' The law interprets what we put into words in this place. We cannot say, `On principle, health, housing and education are important,' and then tie these things in legislatively with the purchase of land. We cannot say, as we sometimes did to the witnesses, `It's the principle of greatest dispossession.' If we are going to stick to that and then put it into legislation, we will be setting the legislation up to fail. We are setting it up for ongoing litigation. As soon as land is granted, there will be a huge range of possibilities for those who did not get land to say, `I'm more dispossessed,' or, `I'm greater disadvantaged,' or, `No, it doesn't link that community to any education services; come back again and have a look at us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the press conference, this is really about spirit sickness. It is about the link of the Aboriginal people to the land. We really cannot talk about Aboriginal health and ignore the fact that the primary health problem of Aboriginal people is their need to have access to their traditional lands. Once we have cured that problem, we can start to look at immunisation programs, at various wellness programs and at health programs for women, men and children. But we cannot get into a situation where we tie this land fund up in endless strings and in reams and reams of red tape so that the whole problem of spirit sickness is simply not addressed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees, I understand your personal circumstances and you have my condolences as to why you did not attend some of the committee hearings. However, it is unfair to attack the committee process of considering the matter whilst hearings were being conducted. That is entirely in order and it is entirely proper.

I did not hear you complain, when we returned to parliament to draft the report, of not having an opportunity to make an input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman, Senator Campbell, did a fantastic job. I compliment my colleagues on this committee for the input and work they put into this report over a time which they normally might have spent at home with their families.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the coalition stuck by the principle of the most severely dispossessed but dumped, as Senator Campbell said, the words `most severely dispossessed'. Let me also refer you to the minority report and tell you that there is misleading information in it. On page 195, 21 organisations are listed as supporting the stand by ATSIC. That is a falsity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not refer to Senator Cooney's report as well. Whilst I disagree with Senator Cooney's comments, they were well measured and considered. I say to the members who wrote the minority report that they have it wrong. There were only 19 organisations that supported ATSIC. I have calculated this and you can check it&mdash;a total of 84 Aboriginal community based organisations gave evidence and only 19 supported the ATSIC stance in part or in whole. That is less than 25 per cent. That is not what the minority report states. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the hearings, rather than isolating the evidence of ATSIC, confirmed that the ATSIC position enjoyed strong support for all or part of its position from community based Aboriginal organisations . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Less than 25 per cent supported that. That is not strong support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey I carried out&mdash;excluding the hearings for Darwin, Broome, Perth and Kalgoorlie because I did not have time to complete them&mdash;found that 18 groups supported the coalition amendment with regard to providing flexibility on how land is granted, while 11 groups opposed it. I am talking about a majority. What we had during these hearings&mdash;and I missed only one day&mdash;was overwhelming criticism of the lack of consultation. This is despite the fact that the government said it consulted extensively and exhaustively and that there had been wide ranging consultation. I do not know where the government consulted, but it certainly did not consult with the 244 individuals who gave evidence before the committee. The great majority of them were not consulted, and that is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition would have loved the opportunity to have consulted with the Aboriginal community in relation to its amendments. However, we did not have that opportunity. The bill was forced upon us pre-Christmas. So we took the only avenue available to us: we moved for this committee to travel around the country&mdash;some 12,000 kilometres&mdash;to consult with various Aboriginal groups and individuals. The committee sent out over 3,000 notices and letters to advertise this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to concentrate on four key amendments. I have mentioned the `most severely dispossessed' amendment. I cite the evidence given by Peter Yu from the Kimberley Land Council:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality [is] that there are varying levels of disadvantage . . . throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA>He conceded that all Aboriginals had been dispossessed but that there were levels or scales of dispossession, of disadvantage. He pointed out that it would be sensible to assist those who were suffering the most disadvantage in terms of access to land. That, I believe, was in support of the coalition's principle of assisting those who were `most severely dispossessed'. We jettisoned those words because they did not meet with favour, and we kept an open mind on that. However, in relation to the question of regional strategies, there was overwhelming support for the government to consult with the grassroots and to devise a national strategy based on regional strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some confusion about this. The Kullarri Regional Council in Broome, which had received the ATSIC package, was of the opinion that this was a bad amendment. When I questioned Mr Hunter on whether he wanted policy to come from the grassroots, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The national policy should reflect what the people at the grassroots are saying. That is how the government is supposed to be set up. You are supposed to listen.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Sibosado followed that immediately with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the regional strategies, you should set the direction for the national strategy rather than the reverse, because the national strategy would be too rigid . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This came from a group who had indicated that they opposed that amendment by the coalition, but when it was explained to them they changed their opinion and supported it. That is what they said, that it must come from the regional strategy, that you must build it up from the grassroots and not from the top down. If this government does not listen to that sort of evidence, then it is missing the boat in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the question of individuals. What we were saying was not that you give land just to individuals but that you have some flexibility so that you can cover this wide diversity that we witnessed over two weeks travelling around the continent; that is, you allow for corporations, trusts, families or individuals. In its report the committee said that it did not envisage that much land would be granted to an individual. Nonetheless, you should have that flexibility. Rosemary O'Grady, who appeared on behalf of the Kamali group, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We disagree with the concept of `corporation' . . . I am a great respecter of the law of corporations, and I believe that corporations are a wonderful invention. However, they are not appropriate for these Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA>We had overwhelming evidence, outstanding evidence, as to the importance of the family unit in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in their daily life and how they conduct themselves and that a good way to approach the matter was on the basis of the family unit. You cannot do that with a corporation. We are not saying that corporations in themselves are evil but that we should have diversity so that the Indigenous Land Corporation can have the ability to choose how it grants the land so that it can accommodate the wide diversity that we came across. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think Senator Campbell is raising a fair point and I want to answer it. I am saying that, if a witness comes before the committee and makes a claim that he or she has not had a chance to consider matters because they had not been consulted and they wanted more time for consultation and they said, `We haven't had a chance to speak to our associates', the only conclusion I can come to&mdash;and it might be wrong&mdash;is that they wanted more time to consult, that they wanted more time to go to their associates. If they wanted more time to consult, if they wanted more time to go to their associates, my conclusion is that their evidence was not as strong or did not have the weight it would have had if they had consulted. I am simply repeating what was said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought, in all innocence, that what was happening was that people were complaining about not being consulted. All I am saying is that, if they were complaining about not being consulted, they must have been complaining for a reason&mdash;that they had not had time to get their evidence prepared. I should imagine that when Senator Campbell, who is very fair, thinks about that he will see the force of what I am saying. All I am saying is that ATSIC did not make those complaints. ATSIC might be wrong, but it did not make those complaints. It said, `We have had enough time. We have had enough consultation. Here is the evidence.' It seems to me, as a person who came to this area not knowing much about it, that that was the sort of evidence that was quite cogent. That is why I accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason I accept the evidence of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, unless it is proved to be wrong, is that in 1989 we passed a bill in this parliament now called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. We made a preamble to that act, which is a bit unusual these days. Amongst those clauses which made up the preamble we said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AND WHEREAS it is also appropriate to establish structures to represent Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of programs and to provide them with an effective voice within the Australian Government;</PARA>
<PARA>We set up a body that was to represent the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on the basis of its being elected. If we want to keep the integrity of the concepts within this act, then we have to take notice of ATSIC. If we find that ATSIC is unsatisfactory, if ATSIC has passed its use-by date, that might be a matter we have to consider. We would go back to the old days of the department of Aboriginal affairs. I say that we should stick with the ATSIC concept until it is shown that something else should be done. If people have a complaint about ATSIC they have the opportunity of voting out the people now in ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish by citing what a great parliamentarian, Sir Winston Churchill, said on 11 November 1947. I see you have some surprise that I should quote such a great man, Mr Acting Deputy President, but nevertheless I shall quote him because this statement applies to ATSIC. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many forms of government have been tried and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms . . .</PARA>
<PARA>ATSIC might have a lot wrong with it, but it is the best thing the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have going for them. If we are going to destroy, prejudice or impair it, then we are not doing the right thing by them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel that time is too valuable to get involved in either political debate or rebuttal, so I would like to use this time to just reflect on some of the aspects of this committee's process and the outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first issues is that a lot has been raised about consultation. I think there is no question that many people felt that the consultation was insufficient; there was a lack of time; and, even if it was consultation, it was not negotiation. We do need to put on the public record that there was a request made in many cases for a moratorium of at least six months for appropriate consultations that would lead to negotiation between Aboriginal groups which had not been consulted by the government in the setting up of the land fund bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot asked earlier: what do we know at the end of the process? I think what the committee definitely established is that there is no unanimity, and neither did we expect it. However, a degree of support emerged for various amendments, which established quite clearly that these amendments mirrored concerns in the Aboriginal community across this country which had not been considered and had not been accepted, if it had considered them, by the government. That is a very important acknowledgment to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one other aspect of the previous discussion that I want to take up: the controversial term `the most severely dispossessed'. It is quite clear that the committee has taken on board the concerns that were expressed in the various hearings regarding this term. People were distressed at any implication that all Aboriginal people had not been dispossessed by white occupation. There was unanimity about that. They did not want to differentiate degrees of dispossession. But it needs to be made clear that many of those people felt it was imperative that the bill include a principle of allocation of a very scarce resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major point here is that it is not a problem with phrasing. The committee has shown itself quite capable of modifying its stance in relation to the specific words. As Senator Evans said earlier, one of the obstacles of this amendment is that the bill, before amendment, states no mechanism for distribution. There is a preference that no principle of allocation of an extra $20 million or so a year be made in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the point: if a principle is unstated, there is no mechanism to ensure who gets in first and who is last. A lot of Aboriginal people would prefer some principle to be stated that relates to dispossession from their traditional lands or to their disadvantage in relation to gaining access to lands. It is a legitimate request that needs to be considered by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second disadvantage of having no principle stated as to the way in which the funds will be allocated is that there is no guarantee within the bill, in the form the government wants it, that acquisition will have any preference over management. So the major concern that underwrites the government's difficulty with this amendment is the fact that, where there is a scarce resource of money available to distribute, some guiding principle should be included. The concern is that it may actually mean that some moneys will have to be given for acquisition of lands rather than the principle that could operate, which is that all could be used for the management of already held indigenous lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) have presented three amendments within the debate which were not supported in the Senate. The committee gave us an opportunity to see whether those concerns&mdash;and they are very specific concerns of the Greens&mdash;were apparent in the wider community. I do not think there was a single person who gave evidence who did not comment on the inadequacy of the amount. A lot of them were totally surprised to know that $1 billion a year was not being allocated, or they thought that at least at the end of 10 years $1 billion would be given for the fund. Some of them were shocked to learn that the increased allocation amounts to only $24 million a year above that which is already available via the ATSIC acquisition and management funding. The comment was made of how inadequate the amount is. It remains a major concern for the Greens and leads to our great difficulty in supporting the land fund bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second issue mentioned in the committee hearings which was not able to be supported either in the Senate or by the majority or minority reports of the committee was the request by many Aboriginal groups for the capacity to revive native title on any land that was acquired. It is a surprising omission that the government cannot look at that because it actually addresses the concern about disposal. If native title were able to be revived, it would mean that it was inalienable and any problem about it being taken away from Aboriginal people would be totally overruled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final point, and one which was raised repeatedly in the hearings, was that Aboriginal people were very concerned that this land fund bill should not be regarded as compensation. Of course if that happened, then those who gain nothing from it may be in jeopardy of really addressing the dispossession that they had suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, following the tabling in the Senate today of the committee's report, the key question still remains of whether the Senate should agree to a land fund which may satisfy the land needs of a small number of people but leave a much larger number with their dispossession unaddressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the process that the committee went through has been, in the end, disappointing. I might clarify here: it was not the least bit disappointing in relation to the witnesses, who all gave extremely valuable testimony which should be respected and deserves respect&mdash;and I hasten to add that, regardless of whether it was given in emotional terms or on a factual basis, it is all worthy of respect; I am not expressing a disappointment with the secretariat, as they did a magnificent job&mdash;and I want to thank them for it; it is not a disappointment with Hansard, who also did a wonderful job, neither is it with the sound technicians; and it is not a disappointment with members of the committee who attended the hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in the end, I do feel disappointed with the stance taken by some members of the committee. The government senators, and Senator Lees from the Democrats, seemed to have taken the role of defending the government bill without amendment. They have, quite rightly, pointed to a lack of unanimity amongst Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. But unfortunately, they have demonstrated an inflexibility in their approach, despite all the criticisms that were levelled at the bill and the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite obvious that there are different views across Australia. But if the land fund is worthy of support, it must go to redressing the dispossession of all Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, not just a select few who may be lucky enough to be targeted by the government bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) believe that the government's bill will in no way go to meeting the land needs of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. I think the committee itself can feel proud that, for the first time, there is a full record of the views of 244 Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders and the organisations that these people represent. This must be the largest record of the views of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders which has been made&mdash;certainly by this parliament. I hope many non-indigenous Australians will read that record which contains the views that were expressed on a political issue which is so dear to the hearts of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens now to this bill is in the hands of the government. It would not listen to the Senate. I believe that the amendments have been supported and are worthy of consideration, particularly if it means that the opposition is willing to support the land fund bill&mdash;a bill which the government seemed to be so eager to gain support for. But, as we have seen, the government refused to listen to the Senate; will it listen to the views of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, at the present time the government's bill is in its own hands. If it seeks to persist with saying that it will only have the unamended bill, then it may be that the bill will fall. However, it has the opportunity of addressing not just the views put up by the parliament, which are legitimate views in their own right, but also those of the Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders across the country who have been consulted and to whom this committee has paid the courtesy of giving a hearing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senators will recall that the Senate made a large number of amendments to the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992. One particular amendment, based on a recommendation of the Select Committee on Community Standards in June 1992, had imposed a moratorium on the broadcasting of R-rated material on pay television while the Australian Broadcasting Authority undertook a program of research into the attitude of Australians to the prospect of R-rated material on pay TV.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Broadcasting Authority tabled its report on 7 December 1994 and, based on the findings of attitudinal research, it has recommended that R-rated material be approved by parliament for broadcasting on pay TV. On that occasion Senator Tierney, Senator Harradine and I made some comments about the ABA report. I was a little more complimentary than Senator Tierney. Nevertheless, we did have some concerns with some of the contradictory statements that came out of that report: not least, I would argue, because it was not possible on the basis of the way in which the research had been undertaken to clarify precisely what kind of R-rated material the findings were based on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those results were contradictory. That is the difficulty that we have faced throughout our inquiry. People are unclear about precisely what is R-rated material. Is it material that has a certain degree of sexual innuendo? Is it material that is realistic in the depiction of sexual activity? Is it material that is a little bit violent; perhaps with one shockingly violent scene or continual violence and violent scenes&mdash;particularly sexually violent scenes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers to those questions are not readily found. It is not found in the community; it is certainly not found by talking to people at the Office of Film and Literature Classification because such a diversity and range of material is put into this R category. That is very much why the committee made the recommendation that we have. I will take the opportunity to read the recommendation in full:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee, having regard to the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) the community's concerns about the levels of violence in the media, especially depictions of sexual violence, and of realistic and degrading, demeaning or exploitative sexual material;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the contradictory views expressed about the effects of such depictions on attitudes and anti-social behaviour; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) the lack of clarity of the R classification which permits an excessively broad range of material to be permitted within its definition;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recommends that R-rated material be not permitted on pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Office of Film and Literature Classification undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the R classification to define with greater precision the criteria to be used in rating violent, sexually violent, realistic and degrading, demeaning or exploitative sexual material, taking into account its intensity and extensiveness, to ensure its appropriateness for viewing in the home environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Attorney-General has tabled a revised R classification, the Committee will reconsider its recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee's report clearly demonstrates the many complexities of this issue. Unfortunately, an opinion given by the Office of the General Counsel suggested that, under the terms of the act, the two houses have to vote either yes or no on the question of whether R-rated material should be permitted to be broadcast on pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the committee's serious concerns about the suitability of much R-rated material to be broadcast on pay TV, the committee has seen the need to recommend that no R-rated material be permitted. However, we have indicated that, if its primary concerns about the range&mdash;the diversity and lack of precision&mdash;contained within the current R classification are met, of course, we will be happy to reconsider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may seem to many senators listening to this debate, and indeed to some members of the community, that if R-rated material is permitted for sale or hire to adults by all state and territory governments within their jurisdictions&mdash;and the Australian Broadcasting Authority found that 82 per cent of respondents to its survey were in favour of adults having the option of watching R-rated programs on pay TV&mdash;then what is the problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that, just as respondents indicate a certain view, if you proceed through the report you find alternative and quite contradictory views expressed; for example, women in particular are extremely concerned about sexually violent material. Equally, contradictory views were expressed about whether people believe that viewing extreme material influences their behaviour. While the research is unable to give a definitive opinion on whether or not there is a link, it is equally unable to demonstrate to us that there is not a certain impact on some disturbed and immature personalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the committee is of the view that there are several problems. The main problem is that, when the officers of the Film Censorship Board assess the appropriateness of a film for classification, they are operating under guidelines which permit them to give the same R classification to depictions of violence, sexual violence and sexual material for cinemas and videos, despite the fact that the age restriction in the case of cinemas is strictly enforced while, in the case of videos, once the material enters the home environment, it is inevitable that minors will gain access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators would be aware that in recent months we invited primary school children to come to the parliament to talk to us about their viewing habits, particularly in relation to a reference we were considering at that time on computer games. We were somewhat alarmed to hear from a number of those primary school children that they were watching R-rated material and, in fact, some have watched X-rated material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, these are not issues about which we can make any form of snap decision, saying, `Maybe there aren't any problems.' I think there is enough concern in the community&mdash;there is enough violence in the community, particularly sexual violence&mdash;for us to take stock and proceed with some caution, and that is what we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators should note that the principle behind the R classification is fundamentally that it is material that is unsuitable for a minor to see. Yet minors can and do gain access to R-rated material on video in the home, and they will have more ready access should R-rated material be permitted on pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be arguments about disabling devices and PINs that make it `impossible' for children or underaged people to gain access to the material. There were all kinds of practical problems that the committee had presented to it from a number of witnesses which suggested that disabling devices, as far as we are aware, are far from foolproof. Because of the nature of the technology, young people are more likely to be au fait and competent in managing the new technology than many parents&mdash;myself included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has undertaken a comprehensive inquiry into the prospect of R-rated material on pay TV. It has taken evidence from a wide range of witnesses. We talked to the industry, of course. We talked to teachers. We talked to parents. We talked to psychologists, academics and a range of other people with a general concern about this issue. We carefully studied the results of attitudinal studies, such as those I have already mentioned conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee notes that there is considerable disquiet in both the expert community and the general community about the effects or the possible effects on attitudes and behaviours of current levels of violence in the media, especially depictions of sexual violence and exploitative sexual material. The committee is concerned about the long-term effects of such material on society, particularly on our youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is contradictory evidence about the effects in the short term, there was a commonality of view that constant exposure to such material not only desensitises the individual but leads to a shift towards a less empathetic culture which may be more accepting of violence as a norm. While the media are only contributors to the development of a nation's culture, the media's influence is nonetheless significant. That is why we have recommended that we proceed with some caution and seek greater clarity from the Office of Film and Literature Classification in regard to definitional issues related to R-rated material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an interview that I gave this afternoon, after the tabling of this report this morning, a particular questioner from the media asked me, `What's going to happen to the industry? If there isn't R-rated material for pay TV, the industry won't survive, it won't make a profit. What will you do then?' I have to say that my answer was very firm: if the pay TV industry is unable to be economically viable without using violence and sexual violence, I think the industry has to look very closely at its motives and its methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a wide diversity of material of entertainment and educational value to which we can apply the new pay TV technology. For the time being, we have said, `If the industry is going to fall in a heap just because it cannot use extremes of violence, then, I am sorry; sometimes in society there are more important issues than the profit motive.' I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I place on record, in my capacity as the chairperson of the committee, my appreciation of the input of my colleagues. The issues we are debating raise very personal and diverse responses. I think it is a tribute to all members of this committee that we have been able to present a unanimous report. On occasions, we wondered whether this would be possible. When we got down to the last few hours and in the final stages and after agreeing to hundreds perhaps thousands of words, we were actually debating whether or not two or three words would be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tribute to all members of the committee that we have reached a consensus. This demonstrates that this is not an issue that is dealt with lightly. It is not an issue for partisan positions. It is an issue which we do not have ready answers for. But, ultimately, what we have done in the recommendations we have made is to say to senators that this is an issue of great importance, an issue that has implications for the future, and we should be absolutely sure about the recommendations we make; therefore, a little more time and precision is required from the Office of Film and Literature Classification before we can make a final report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the debate on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards which inquired into R-rated material on pay TV and to support the remarks of Senator Reynolds. What we have been through over the last 2 1/2 years with the production of this report and the consideration of this issue is a very long and, at times, arduous debate. I pay special tribute to the chair of the committee, Senator Margaret Reynolds, for the way she has guided this process over that time. We have been debating two principles in the censorship act. One is that adults should be able to see and hear what they like and the other is that children should be protected. As legislators we have a very awesome responsibility in relation to where we finally draw the line and what we allow into society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay a special tribute to a former member of the committee, my predecessor as deputy chair, Shirley Walters. Since retiring from the Senate she has been following this matter with great interest. She was a major contributor to the debate in the early days. I think it is a great tribute to democracy that across all parties&mdash;coalition parties, the Labor Party and the Democrats and independents; Senator Brian Harradine made a major contribution&mdash;in the end we could debate this matter for so long and then finally come to a resolution and an agreed set of words and an agreed set of recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something that the public does not often hear about. Politicians are bagged all over the place and people watch question time and make disparaging comments about it. But the report we have before us is a good news report. The press does not very often come in and watch the actual procedures that go into making these reports. It is not something they report on. If everybody is very cooperative members of the press do not tend to say very much about it. They like to report conflict and division. That accounts for a very small amount of the time spent in this place. Most of the time a group of reasonable people sit around in committees trying to work out what is best for the nation. I think the work of this committee is an excellent example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have done in our work over time is basically three things. One is that we have monitored the research of the ABA which, as the broadcasting act was set up, was supposed to be a major adviser on this issue. Having had several concerns about this matter, we conducted very wide community consultations and spoke to many experts in this field. Then, as I have already indicated, we carried out a considerable amount of debate in the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main issue we were concerned with, in terms of what the legislation originally set out to do, was the way the ABA research was conducted. It is regrettable that the ABA did not listen a little more clearly to what the committee was saying because we had major reservations about the ABA's research. I do not want to go into that in great detail at this point because I have put it on the Senate record at other times. Just to summarise basically what was wrong: when you carry out research, particularly surveys in the community, you should in the end be measuring what you think you are measuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem with what the ABA was doing with its research was that it was dealing with something that it was very difficult for the public to understand; that is, the nature of R. Senator Reynolds has alluded to some of these problems. The research showed that 30 per cent of people have never seen an R-rated program. It is very difficult to give a judgment on something you have never seen. The other thing that Senator Reynolds mentioned was that a lot of the research was internally contradictory. A majority of people said they wanted R but the report also showed that they did not really want sex and violence, sexual violence in particular. Under R, as it is currently defined, sexual violence is allowed&mdash;under certain conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became very clear to the committee that people, not having seen the movies or the full range of R, not really understanding what is a very complex and murky sort of definition of R, could not come to some sort of reasonable conclusion base. I suppose in a research sense the only way you could have got a result was to sit people down and make them watch a full range of R material and then make a decision. You would have got a correct reflection if you had done that, but in a democracy you cannot sit people down and force them to watch material they do not want to watch. If you let people self-select, you get a biased survey. So the conundrum we were faced with was that the ABA was researching something that could not be researched properly anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem was that the ABA drew incorrect conclusions from that research; and its internal inconsistency is something I have pointed out already. That is why probably the major recommendation in this report is to hold fire on this issue for a while and let the Office of Film and Literature Classification come up with a definition of R that more reflects what happens in R and get a system that is a little more sophisticated to take into account the extensiveness and intensity of the material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an example of two films that showed the range of problems, there is a delightful movie that has an R classification called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World According to Garp</EMPHASIS>. It has an R classification but the reasons for the R are reasonably subtle and you would probably be reasonably comfortable with most teenagers and children watching it. On the other hand, the horrific movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> that has been banned around the world and has been banned in Australia for 17 years finally slipped through the Film Review Board and is now available with an R classification. Admittedly, it has some restrictions but we are finding increasingly that those restrictions are broken. I am reasonably confident that this material will end up on pay TV some day. What are people to make of it as they both have an R classification?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a great problem trying to get expert opinion if we were not satisfied with what the ABA had to say. Most of the research in this area tries to link cause and effect. When you are talking about human behaviour in complex social situations it is extremely difficult for any social scientist to say, `This cause has this effect' and tease it out from all the other causes. That does not mean that the cause and effect are not there but that, with the complexity of the situation and the limited tools of the social scientist and the psychologist, it is difficult to establish it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found an increasing amount of anecdotal and disturbing evidence that there were socially and personally undesirable outcomes from people watching this sort of material. The anecdotal material is building at a fairly alarming rate. There is the case in the United Kingdom of the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Childsplay 3</EMPHASIS>, where some young children murder a younger child. The children in the Bulger case murdered James Bulger in circumstances remarkably parallel with the videotape, and that is just one example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to establish cause and effect but one thing the researchers all agree on is that watching this sort of material can have a reinforcing effect. This is of great concern when it is put into the home environment. If men watch movies involving violent scenes between men and women it is not going to make them into wife bashers. But if they are wife bashers already&mdash;and there is a considerable number of those in our community&mdash;watching that material will reinforce that sort of behaviour. We have social programs which try to stop events like wife bashing but if the parliament allows this sort of material into the community, it can countermand what we are trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of great concern to the committee was rapidly evolving technology. This technology may be of some assistance with R and pay TV because there are disabling devices. We were not convinced, having looked at the evidence overseas, that these disabling devices would work sufficiently well. Senator Reynolds has pointed out some of the reasons why a disabling device probably will not work. Parents do not switch it on, children get around the system and the Canadian evidence, in particular, indicates that a large number of children would get access to this sort of material even with that technology. But perhaps the most frightening prospect of the technology is that it is evolving so rapidly that if we set down a legislative regime now, we do not know what the technology is going to be in 10, 15 or 20 years. Shades of it are already appearing. Indeed, some of the products that can rapidly change what we have are already coming onto the market. To give you some examples: the fact that we now have a telephone, a television and a computer as three separate entities will disappear probably in the next five to 10 years. We will have one unit that will do all three things. So television technology, which R and pay would come down to, could be easily merged with computer technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the CD-ROMs now available it would be possible to put material on it that is horrific and very graphic. This graphicness can be added to considerably by the advent of virtual reality. The way it could work is you could plug a headset in, put it on your head and, instead of watching a television screen, the effect of the new technology is that it seems like you are there, just as we are here now looking at others. That will create greater intensity and the possibility of repetitiveness. The effects of this on the social behaviour of young people, given their young and immature minds, could be dramatic. We must have great concern about that. That is the reason we believe that what we do with pay TV perhaps should be more analogous to what we did with computer games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Video computer games technology will merge with this technology within the next five to 10 years. The Attorneys-General, state and federal, quite wisely decided to stop this material at the MA classification and have no R and X. That is what we are suggesting with this material. Because of rapid social change, because of rapid technological change in this area, bar on pay TV, this legislation should proceed with great caution. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not suggest that we agree with them all the time, and I suppose that is one of the issues at stake in our report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are bound as a parliament to give serious consideration to the consequences of having another level of readily available R classified material in the home environment. I feel that is a major issue and is reflected in the report. Other speakers have referred to the range of material that is contained in the R classification. The guidelines are repeated on page 67 of our report, which deals with why a film is rated R&mdash;18+. It states that material considered likely to be harmful to those under 18 and of possible offence to some sections of the adult community warrants an R classification. So far as language is concerned, there are virtually no restrictions on language in R films. Sexual intercourse or other sexual activity may be realistically implied or simulated. Highly realistic and explicit depictions of violence may be shown but not if unduly detailed, relished or cruel. Depictions of sexual violence are acceptable only to the extent that they are necessary to the narrative and not exploitative. Drug abuse may be depicted but not in an advocacy manner. Extreme horror and special effects usually warrant an R. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw that film in a theatre as part of my duties. I must say that I have seen numerous R and X classified films and videos. I looked at that film with one half of my mind on the actual classification guidelines and the other half on the screen. At the same time I was attempting to assess the technical merit of the film. In my view, that film clearly should not have received an R classification. To its credit, the OFLC did not give it an R classification, but the Film and Literature Board of Review did. Therefore, the themes and depictions contained in that film can be included in the R classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we asked a representative of the Film and Literature Board of Review whether that film would get an R classification if were submitted as a video, the response was that it would probably not receive a classification. In other words, it would be refused classification. That is very interesting. Obviously, that presumably meant that the board saw a difference between an R category that could be shown in the cinemas and an R category that could go into the home environment. How this suggestion makes sense under existing laws is yet to be fully tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also seen other R-rated films, one of which did include sexual violence. To my mind, it was a serious treatment of the particular issue involved. To my mind, it was appropriately classified R. It appears that the word `extent' used by the OFLC to qualify the R category guidelines depends on the particular interpretation the censor places on it on a particular occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying is that the classification presently encompasses too broad a range. We have said that the OFLC should undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the R classification to define, with greater precision, the criteria to be used in rating violent, sexually violent, realistic and degrading, demeaning or exploitative sexual material, taking into account its intensity and extensiveness, to ensure its appropriateness for viewing in the home environment&mdash;bearing in mind that children, as well as persons of disturbed or immature minds, are inevitably going to view the material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to violent material and sexually violent material. We also refer to material that is realistic, degrading and demeaning or exploitative sexual material. There is some R classified material which is not physically violent but is demeaning and degrading. For example, a number of the R classified films have the same theme content and intent as the X classification, save only that they have been taken at a different angle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these films have themes of sexual harassment involving  workplace sexual favours. In my view, they are demeaning and degrading. There are also films in the R category which, whilst not physically violent, could be termed `exploitative sexual material'. That material commodifies and objectifies women, mainly. Rather than treating them as free and responsible initiators of human activities, that sort of material, although non-violent, treats women as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience. Group sex scenes depicting diverse sexual activities are a feature of much of that material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be said by some that this is `spice' material and suitable for going into the home environment. Let me tell the Senate that we received evidence indicating that counsellors and psychologists are concerned that this material is used as a facilitator for the sexual abuse of women and children. That must be of concern to the community. We did have evidence that children of around the age of eight can distinguish, so far as violent material is concerned, between fantasy acting and real life. It just so happens that the exploitative sexual material I am talking about is real life. If somebody in the home environment is attempting to seduce a child victim&mdash;and we had evidence that this has occurred&mdash;then the child, obviously, in viewing this material, would not be able to make such a distinction because it would be depicting what was actually happening. That is something we should be concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time has nearly expired&mdash;I have one minute to go&mdash;so I will conclude by saying this: the legislation does say that there should be disabling devices if R-rated material is on pay TV. We have dealt with the question of disabling devices in, I think, chapter 5 of this report. As the chairperson has said, nobody is going to suggest that they are absolutely foolproof, but they do assist. I commend parents and others to have disabling devices if they have subscribed to pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Senate. I hope that in a cooperative way the OFLC and the Attorney-General will take on board our recommendations so that we can revisit this matter and the parliament can then have a look at the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to the adjournment debate tonight is to deal with the forestry issue and, in particular, to place on record a response to matters raised by Senator Coulter yesterday during the debate on the motion of censure of Senator Faulkner. During that debate Senator Coulter stressed the importance of the South Australian Forestry Commission, which runs at a profit and has been based on plantations for a long time. I then interjected, requesting Senator Coulter to indicate to the Senate and the people of Australia exactly how much natural forest is left in the state of South Australia. He then said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You make my point exactly. The other states should have been planting plantations over many decades.</PARA>
<PARA>He then praised the softwood plantations in South Australia. It is important for the record to be set straight because basically what Senator Coulter is doing is praising the work of the founders of South Australia, who basically levelled the forests within that state and then replaced them with softwood plantations. As a Tasmanian senator it is somewhat rich having to listen to a lecture from a South Australian senator about world heritage values and environmental values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a look at South Australia and compare its record to my home state of Tasmania we get some very interesting figures. A total of 20.2 per cent of my home state is in world heritage areas. In other words, slightly over one-fifth of my home state is completely locked up and will never be subjected to the chainsaw or the axe. That is 1.37 million hectares out of 6.793 million hectares in Tasmania. That is a very large proportion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us then have a look at South Australia's record. South Australia has a land mass 13 times that of Tasmania&mdash;indeed, a land mass of 98.4 million hectares. We then ask: out of that 98.4 million hectares, how much is world heritage listed? Guess what the answer is&mdash;only 300 hectares. That is, 0.0003 per cent of South Australia is world heritage listed compared to 20.2 per cent of Tasmania. Yet Senator Coulter comes in here trying to lecture about how the forest industry ought be run. The simple point is that a state that is one-thirteenth the size of South Australia has 4,566 times the amount of world heritage area of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the people of Australia to realise that Tasmanians have looked after their forests very well and have a very credible record. If Senator Coulter is praising the South Australian situation, he is in fact praising the levelling of all forests and the replacement of them by softwoods. That, unfortunately, is the attitude of so many of the armchair environmentalists who seek to pontificate on this issue. This issue, which has been at the heart of most parliamentary debates this past fortnight, has an impact on individual men, women, families and their children. Just the other day, I received a letter. It was addressed to a number of coalition  senators including myself. It said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to give the Senate and the people of my home state of New South Wales some insights into community leadership as practised by Bob Carr. The leader of the ALP opposition in New South Wales aspires to be the premier and lead the state in the community. As a leader of the opposition he is showing a disturbing pattern of abrogating leadership when it comes to his involvement in important community and state occasions. Mr Carr now has a confirmed record of rude and insulting behaviour at a number of New South Wales public functions over a period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the Senate in detail of his reclusive habits when he is on duty at public functions in New South Wales. Take the beatification ceremony and the papal mass at Randwick racecourse on 19 January last&mdash;a great public occasion for New South Wales and Australia. It was the ultimate celebration of Christianity and Catholicism&mdash;a milestone in the recognition of Australian womanhood through the pioneering Blessed Mary MacKillop. Nearly all New South Wales government agencies played a major role in assisting with the logistics of the papal visit for this great occasion in New South Wales history, one not to be forgotten by all in attendance at this mass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I joined with community leaders and over 200,000 people at this solemn, moving and uplifting occasion. It was a great tribute to the work of dedicated members of the Sisters of St Joseph. All this sense of occasion and historical moment, but where was the New South Wales Leader of the Opposition? Mr Carr insulted the occasion and the New South Wales community at this very special time in our history. During the solemn mass and ceremony Mr Carr left his seat in the stand&mdash;not for a short time but for an extended absence for a good part of a three-hour ceremony and papal mass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where was he? Mr Carr adjourned to the lounge area behind the stand. He was absent from his post as the leading citizen of New South Wales. What drew him away? The chance to drink coffee and eat potato chips plus engage in convivial conversation with New South Wales ALP MP Brian Langton and South Australian ALP Leader of the Opposition, Mike Rann. Such behaviour was more than mere discourtesy. On such a special occasion it was an insult to all Australian Christians. Discourtesy and insult seem to be stock-in-trade for Mr Carr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was no momentary lapse; it was part of a pattern. The previous evening Mr Carr walked out of the Domain before the Mary MacKillop pageant, turning his back on the magnificent Australian artists performing on the night. On Australia Day he walked off stage and left the ceremony during the Sydney Chinatown Australia Day tribute. He left while the member for Lowe, Mary Easson, was reading the message from the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Later the same day Mr Carr left Darling Harbour just before a major New South Wales Australia Day event had commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the pattern of Bob Carr, the recluse who has no sense of occasion. New South Wales citizens should have the benefit of knowing the record of Bob Carr on leadership and upholding community occasions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to speak about an Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision affecting an important company in Tasmania&mdash;Comalco, at Bell Bay. The Industrial Relations Commission seems to have been the subject of a number of controversial decisions in recent months. Australia's industrial relations environment has become a fiasco in which employers are uncertain of their responsibilities and employees are uncertain of their rights. In past times there was a general belief that government had a responsibility to ensure that employers and employees were provided with a framework of legislation within which each group could sensibly go about their work with a reasonable expectation of fairness and justice under the law. It is therefore most regrettable to see that, in December, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission made a decision ruling the staff employment contracts of Comalco Aluminium at Bell Bay invalid. It is particularly regrettable because, without duress, the vast majority of Comalco's work force had voluntarily, and after much negotiation and discussion, chosen to enter into these contracts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Comalco aluminium smelter at Bell Bay in northern Tasmania was originally established in the 1950s by the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments combined. Comalco took over the operation in 1961 and expanded the size of the smelter to a peak employee level of nearly 1,300 workers in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drive to keep the smelter viable in the face of falling world aluminium prices and in competition with larger, newer and more technologically advanced smelters both in Australia and overseas has seen the work force reduced to a current level of just over 600 people. This has been done by employing more efficient management techniques and better working practices and, where possible, by ensuring that the best possible productivity levels are achieved from the now ageing technology of the 40-year-old plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comalco Aluminium at Bell Bay has been a large employer in northern Tasmania as well as providing many jobs for ancillary and support businesses in the area and throughout the state. It still continues to produce aluminium and provide jobs, even though it is now accepted that its long-term future can only really exist in changed electricity supply situations, with redeveloped plant and changed workplace situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these needs in mind and facing the essential task of maximising productivity within the limited and now ageing technology available, Comalco management has recently set about the job of reforming its work force culture. During 1993 and 1994, Comalco conducted negotiations with its non-staff employees with the aim of bringing all workers on to staff and employed under individual contracts. Following offers to 430 workers to accept staff contracts in mid-1994, 408 accepted the offer. As the contracts were to rely to a considerable extent on an environment of trust between levels of employees, the fact that so many workers accepted this change reflected very well on the industrial relations culture existing at the Bell Bay plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For most of the workers who signed the contracts and joined the staff, pay levels rose considerably&mdash;in some cases by about $8,000 a year. But the intent of many of the changed conditions related to acceptance of a heightened concept of mutual benefit and responsibility amongst all workers. It should be emphasised that those workers who elected not to take up the offer of staff employment were not disadvantaged and continue to work under their relevant award. The company also accepted that the award served a role as a safety net for those who have accepted staff contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the changeover&mdash;remembering that this occurred as recently as the middle of last year&mdash;a number of trends in productivity and quality control have shown marked improvements. There have been fewer injuries; less sick leave has been taken; there have been better purity levels of metal produced; and there has been a markedly improved attitude  reflected through workers' responsibility to their work and their commitment to the wellbeing of the plant. Notwithstanding the increased expenditure flowing from the acceptance of staff contracts, Comalco has been able to claim a decreased cost of production per tonne since the changes were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this would appear to have been a win-win situation seldom seen in industrial relations issues. But not so. Enter the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In December the commission decided that the company's individual work contracts were invalid. The Industrial Relations Commission decision basically ruled that individual contracts do not fit into the present industrial landscape under present legislation. Thankfully, it is likely that this could well be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sooner the Keating government gets its industrial relations act together, the sooner companies like Comalco and its workers will be able to get on with the job of making our economy and our country more competitive in the world market. The longer that industrial relations is based on the priority to protect the union's hold on Australian workers and to protect the jobs of union bosses before the jobs of ordinary Australian working people, the longer Australia will stay uncompetitive and unable to create modern, efficient work practices. The old adversarial approach to industrial relations is no longer appropriate. I thank the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) They are employed by Austrade under a joint Austrade and Defence-funded program.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Austrade, like other Commonwealth agencies, is responsible for satisfying itself as to the trustworthiness, reliability, loyalty, maturity and character of potential employees; it has the authority to deny a security clearance to an applicant that does not meet these requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am advised that all three Trade Commissioners were employed in accordance with standard Austrade procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Government addressed these issues in its response, tabled on 7 December 1994, to a report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation dated March 1994 and entitled ASIO and Security Assessment: A Review of Security Assessment Procedures. The Government is satisfied that the existing appeal processes for adverse security clearances by agency heads (as distinct from security assessments by ASIO), which are available within Commonwealth agencies (including Austrade) and externally through the Merit Protection and Review Agency or the Ombudsman, are adequate and appropriate. The Security Appeals Tribunal remains the avenue for review of qualified or adverse security assessments by ASIO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that ASIO's role has long been confined to issuing security assessments which deal with the question of whether the employment of an applicant might present any risk to security as that term is defined in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. As explained in the response to (2) above, the employing agency is responsible for satisfying itself as to the trustworthiness, reliability etc of potential employees whose duties may require them to have access to classified material or places. This is the security clearance of which ASIO's security assessments form part. This division of responsibilities and the existing procedures conform with recommendations made in 1977 by Mr Justice Hope in his Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security and re-affirmed by him in his report on the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question also mentions the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. I am advised that the Inspector-General has no role in relation to these matters. The statutory charter of the Inspector-General expressly precludes him from reviewing ASIO's conduct of security assessments&mdash;that is the function of the Security Appeals Tribunal&mdash;and limits his jurisdiction to the five intelligence agencies.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a preliminary comment to the Honourable Senator's questions, it should be noted that the matters to which the Senator refers relate to regulation under the former co-operative scheme of corporate regulation in respect of which the Commonwealth Government had no determinative role.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Mr Wholley took up duty as Trade Commissioner Hanoi in April 1992 and his posting is scheduled to terminate in June 1996. This new position was created coincident with the establishment of an Austrade office within the Embassy structure in Hanoi to capitalise on emerging commercial opportunities as a result of Vietnam's move to a market driven economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Mr Wholley moved into the Metropole Hotel on his arrival in Hanoi, then the only hotel of international standard, and occupied a junior suite. From September 1992 when he was joined by his wife, they occupied a complex of two standard connecting rooms, the smallest available in the hotel, with a total area of 72 square metres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wholley and his wife moved out of the hotel into a house in early October 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Accommodation costs were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">junior suite&mdash;$A1,660.00 per week</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">house&mdash;$A2,550.00 per week</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Mr Wholley was in the hotel from April 1992 to September 1994 whilst a search for permanent accommodation was undertaken. The limited availability of suitable housing in Hanoi is well documented. During 1992 and 1993, there were no international standard purpose built apartments or houses available for lease in the city and renovation of older houses was the only viable option for accommodation of an acceptable standard. Two features of the intensive and frustrating ongoing search were the number of houses in poor condition which would have been too costly to renovate and those which, being otherwise suitable, were too costly to lease in the face of serious competition from commercial interests. A lease was signed early in 1994 on a suitable property which, having undergone renovation, has been occupied since October 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Total accommodation costs are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in hotel 4 April 1992&mdash;30 September 1994&mdash;$A304,826</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in house 1 October 1994&mdash;31 December 1994 (present)&mdash;$A33,150.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand Mr Wholley has performed particularly well in servicing Austrade's clients in difficult circumstances, not the least of which has been the relative discomfort of confined hotel accommodation for him and his wife over an extended period.</PARA>
