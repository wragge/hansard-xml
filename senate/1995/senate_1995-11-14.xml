The procedure we are referring to is a primary dispute resolution in preference to court proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment provides a court with a power to give directions concerning the conduct of conferences between the parties and family and child counsellors or welfare officers. This will include the power to order that the parties must not come into direct contact during the conference process. This is particularly important because it may reduce the chance of a violent confrontation where the particular case before the court has a history of violence. It is my understanding that the coalition may consider supporting this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There does appear to be some merit in amendment No. 14 moved by Senator Spindler. There may well be occasions when it is not appropriate for certain things to happen and the judge in question may well be aware of that and, presumably, should be able to give those directions. It is not necessarily to be seen as a judge assuming that they have the capacity to stand in the shoes of a counsellor and have all those skills. It is just that the judge may well be aware of certain matters that ought to be taken into account in the conduct of the parties as they proceed. Therefore, amendment 14 may well have some merit in it. I would be interested in the government view as to why it should not accept that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice is that Senator Spindler's amendment gives the power to the court to make directions as to the conduct of a conference it orders under the proposed section. The section will allow the court to direct the parties to proceedings affecting children to attend a conference with a family and child counsellor or welfare officer to discuss the care, welfare and development of the child and to try to resolve differences between the parties. Counselling ordered under this section is confidential and a conference ordered under the section must be distinguished from a conference conducted for the purpose of preparing a report under proposed section 62G.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told this amendment asks the court to make decisions about how the counsellor or welfare officer should conduct that conference. Those decisions are, we believe, most appropriately made by the counsellor or the welfare officer who has the appropriate experience, training and capacity to determine what procedures are most appropriate to assist in successful counselling. We agree that counselling should not require a person who is in fear of another person to come into direct contact with that person. The issue here, however, is who is the appropriate person to make a decision about appropriate procedures. A conference will be ordered under the proposed section only if the court considers that discussion of the care, welfare and development of the child may be of assistance to the parties in reaching agreement. That is unlikely to occur in circumstances where the court considers it is inappropriate that the parties come into direct contact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that the insertion of the provision may well indicate to counsellors that the absence of a direction that the parties do not come into direct contact means that the court considers that a face-to-face conference is appropriate. That is of concern to us. This could, of course, lead to counsellors not feeling able to exercise their professional judgment about the appropriate procedures which could be used and this could lead to parties being placed in situations of risk which would not occur if the judgment was exercised by the person best placed to do so, the counsellor or the welfare officer. There is a concern that in the absence of a court order a counsellor may feel as if there is no impediment to such a meeting. Our concern is based on that. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would rather leave the discretion totally in the hands of the counsellors, without any indication&mdash;direct or indirect&mdash;that could lead to a situation where counsellors may feel as if there is a green light when in fact it should be up to their judgment to make a decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the concerns that the minister has expressed, it seems to me that it is perfectly in order in normal circumstances for the counsellor to make that decision. We are not making the court's intervention mandatory; we are simply providing the discretion and the power for the court to do so when it is brought to the court's notice that there are circumstances in a particular case where the parties should not be brought face to face. It is simply an additional safeguard that is introduced. I think the committee should think carefully before it decides not to provide that additional safeguard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take on board what Senator Spindler is trying to achieve, but could the minister confirm that that could take place in any event&mdash;that there is no requirement that the parties need to come face to face for the purposes of a conference without this amendment to the legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just on that point, the argument that the minister brought forward before was that the counsellor should be left entirely to decide how the counselling conference should be conducted and that we should not give the court the power to intervene and to decide that there should not be face-to-face confrontation. That seems to me to confirm my point that, unless this amendment is passed, the court will simply leave it to the counsellor to decide. We are saying that in normal circumstances we are quite happy to do that, but there may be the odd case where the counsellor overlooks or disregards whatever evidence is available about previous violence in that situation, and in that case the court, when its attention is drawn to it, should have the power to make such an order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the minister's argument, on balance, is more persuasive than Senator Spindler's. There is something to be said for saying that once the opportunity is there for the court to give those directions when they are not given the assumption is that the matter has been considered and responsibility, if you like, the need to consider those factors by the counsellor, can be waived. That might be the risk you run, too. We just have to have some faith that counsellors know what they are doing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some difficulty with the suggested amendment. I think we would all agree that to ensure safety from family violence is an absolutely important and essential element of any aspect of family law legislation. As I read the objects of the part `to promote the best interests of children and in particular to ensure that children receive adequate and proper parenting', I would have thought those words, as of necessity, would have meant that if family violence were to occur children would not be receiving adequate and proper parenting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that Senator Spindler is doing is adding an example of a type of behaviour that would indicate that children are not receiving proper parenting. Whilst I agree with that, why don't we also add in protection from child abuse or protection from a father who might gamble away all the income of the family, so that the children do not have to live in poverty, or ensure that the children are properly fed, that the children are properly clothed, or that the children's spiritual needs are met? A whole host of other examples could be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I agree with the motive of Senator Spindler in moving the amendment, I think in a way it detracts from child welfare in total because there would be nearly the suggestion that if you want to promote the best interests of the child all you have to ensure is that there is no family violence. Sure, we do not want to see family violence, but I do not think we want to have a specific clause which, in effect, detracts from the generality and the importance of ensuring that a child's welfare in total is looked after. I would be interested to hear Senator Spindler's reason for only picking on family violence as opposed to all the other matters that I have referred to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motivation is simply to ensure that the bill as it stands pays sufficient regard to the dangers inherent in a situation where family violence has been part of the history. Certainly, we have received submissions from diverse women's organisations concerned about the aspects of family violence and concerned that they are not adequately covered in the bill as it stands. It is on that basis that the amendment is put forward. I think by emphasising that and ensuring that it is dealt with, one does not in any way devalue or exclude other considerations that are relevant to the child's welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would point out that the clause we are trying to amend, 60B(2)(a), says that children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents. It is this edict which we are referring to. The amendment says `except when it is in the best interests of the child.' Former partners or separating partners could interpret it and say, `Well, it says here that the children are now to be cared for by both their parents.' It seemed to us, the Democrats, and to people who have made representations to us, that that needs to be qualified&mdash;that there can be situations where that is not in the best interests of the child.

If there is still reason to believe that information may come to them about the child's location, then another order can be obtained. In practice, orders requiring a person to do something over a period longer than 12 months are likely to be ineffective, as the time period is certainly too long for people to remain aware of the importance and the effect of such orders. As I have said, if there is a need for a continuation, then a further order can be obtained.

I understand the minister to have said that after 12 months you get the parties back again and the matter is considered again. I think it is desirable in all cases for there to be finality about matters as much as possible to save the parties having to come back after 12 months.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Justice of the Family Court, Mr Justice Nicholson, strongly criticised this proposal by the government. His Honour stated before the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The penalty is both unnecessary and objectionable. The court objects strongly to it and points out that such a sanction is found nowhere else in the Family Law Act. The capacity in which registrars will often deal with this type of information is in the exercise of delegated judicial power, and it is particularly inappropriate that those with such power be liable to a criminal sanction arising out of its exercise. Under the court staff structure, registry managers and not registrars have line responsibility for registry staff and so for the recording and storage of court records. The registrar to whom this sanction would apply consequently has no capacity to direct the secure receipt, storage and handling of the information. Given the sensitive nature of the court's records, it is illogical that there be a criminal sanction in respect to the treatment of one type of information alone.</PARA>

For instance, the Family Law Council has recommended the imposition of a penalty. In its report in relation to the power of the Family Court to require the provision of information for the recovery of children just a couple of years ago the council endorsed the proposal that a penalty of some $12,000 or two years imprisonment or both be imposed for the unauthorised disclosure of information obtained under the equivalent provision at the time. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information provided to the Registrar of a court under a location order . . . must not, intentionally or recklessly, be disclosed by the Registrar, or by any other person who obtains the information . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We are really arguing&mdash;if there is any argument, and I am not assuming that the opposition has excluded supporting this amendment&mdash;that if we argue against having any penalty at all we are really arguing for privilege of officers of the court and saying that there can be no malicious or intentional errors in this regard because the court is such a safe place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there have been breaches and they have been followed up, I would be interested to receive any evidence of them. But I would be very concerned if the opposition felt that if none could be produced we would not need this clause or the penalty that goes with it. In my view, out in the community there is a suspicion and a fear of court proceedings. If people felt that somehow there were no safeguards on the information and that court officers, of whatever capacity, could act with impunity because there were no penalties, whether they did that or not, it would give apparent grounds for that concern in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason I urge people to support what I believe is a very reasonable amendment. It is removing the penalty of two years imprisonment, which I think could be an affront to the court, because I believe it is using imprisonment in a wrong way. On the other hand, to remove penalties altogether implies that we do not feel that the registrars and the officers within the court who might be associated with the disclosure of information should have any sanctions placed upon them should they breach the trust placed in them. It is a community trust we are talking about and I believe a penalty is worth while, whether it has been pursued in the past or not.

Chief Justice Nicholson was the person urging us to do this because he felt it would be an affront to the court staff to imply that anybody would be engaged in that conduct. I am sure he would also want the community to perceive his officers and the officers of the court as being as susceptible to penalties as is anybody in the community; and, as we know very well, penalties of this kind are sprinkled right throughout our legislative system.</PARA></TALK.START>

Although he is an officer of the court, I would suggest that person would not necessarily be engaged in service or execution of process on behalf of the court.

My concern with his argument is that he does not want even the clause in there and he does not want people to have to obey that clause.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I note that just before paragraph 1.62 we quote nobody less than the Chief Judge of the Family Court, Mr Justice Nicholson. In part, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Court's staff structure Registry managers and not Registrars have line responsibility for registry staff and so for the recording and storage of Court records. The Registrar to whom the sanction would apply consequently has no capacity to direct the secure receipt, storage and handling of the information. Given the sensitive nature of the Court's records it is illogical that there be a criminal sanction in respect of the treatment of one type of information alone.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is based on the simple principle that children are not chattels, and that they should not be treated as chattels. Where two parties are debating what should happen, we cannot always go behind the agreement that is made or behind the evidence that is provided to the court. Very often the interests of the adults, the separating partners, may well not reflect the interests of the child. The partners may make a deal or agreement that suits them. They may trade off financial advantages against factors that affect the welfare of the child or children. While the court has ordered separate representation a lot more frequently since the decision in re Kay, I believe that we should enshrine as a principle that children are entitled to separate representation.</PARA>

One could simply look at New Zealand and say, `Well, New Zealand hasn't gone broke.' In fact, New Zealand is doing rather better economically than Australia at the moment. So that, I believe, is not an argument. The argument really is: are we prepared to put some financial savings in the running of the Family Court ahead of the interests of the child; or do we say that a child is a person and is entitled to representation so that the child's interests can be impartially assessed and brought to the notice of the court?</PARA>

You are saying that you want the discretion taken away from the court and you want mandatory representation. That is entirely different from saying that you want a principle established that children are entitled to representation. That already is established. The court has got a responsibility to look at the interests of the child and ascertain whether the child needs representation and, if it does, to so order.

But it does not automatically follow from that convention that your amendment ought to be passed. That is a disingenuous argument for you to put. It is an argument that does encourage some people, whom I admit are less informed than yourself, into the blind thinking that, because there is a convention on this, anything that someone wants to propose that is vaguely attached to it somehow has to become a law. You are encouraging the argument that the presence of a convention diminishes the responsibility and right of this chamber and other parliaments to decide the best way for Australia to comply with its international responsibilities.

There was some confusion when Senator Spindler withdrew amendments 36 and 37. I was looking at the wrong amendments and trying to come to grips with them when they were carried. I think our carrying of amendment 38 might be inconsistent with our rejection of amendment 15. But I just flag that at this stage for the minister and advisers to possibly consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing clause 39, I do not think there is any need for a child to be represented on each and every occasion, no matter what the circumstances. This will say that, even if consenting orders come before the court and even if mum and dad have agreed as to what ought to happen with the children, the children should somehow still be subjected to an unnecessary third party. It is bad enough for children to have to go through counselling and the difficulty of the parental split-up without requiring them to be interviewed by a solicitor, who is usually a complete and utter stranger with whom the children have no relationship, no trust and no shared values. Somebody who is appointed by the court is virtually foisted upon them. Clearly, where there are major disputes between mum and dad, and the children are of an age where they can give expression to their views and wishes, it would be appropriate to possibly have the child separately represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What usually happens, which I think is appropriate, is that, if a matter does blow up to a major battle in the court, the court can order a family report, which is prepared by the court counselling service which interviews family members and, if need be, the extended family. It talks to the children, et cetera, and then provides a report to the court which is then part of the material on which the judge relies to make his or her decision about the future of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that the court must appoint I think imposes further legalisms into the system. It will undoubtedly add to the cost of justice for the parties concerned or, if the taxpayer has to pay for it, it will be an extra burden on the taxpayer. I say to Senator Spindler that, if there is no obvious reason at all as to why the child ought to be separately represented, why on earth should we incur that cost and impose that cost upon taxpayers, delay the legal system and cause unnecessary further dislocation to the children involved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in clause 3 of the proposed amendment that the person to be appointed is to be by reason of personality, cultural background, training and experience suitably qualified to represent the child. Does that mean that if we have a bit of an arrogant child we ought to appoint an arrogant lawyer or if we have a bit of a deceitful child we ought to appoint a deceitful lawyer? What happens if the child is a girl? Does that mean as of necessity we need a female lawyer to represent that child?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens if an immigrant like me marries a fifth generation Tasmanian? How do we cater for the cultural background of those children? We can extend this list on and on and get into a situation where, quite frankly, we would have quite a ridiculous outcome. We need people who are appropriately qualified in the law and who have some training in relation to children to represent the children. In general terms, I think the legal aid commissions around Australia do that relatively well. I cannot see any need for there to be a change. If every case that comes before the court, even consent orders, has to involve a third lawyer I think that will increase the cost of justice and will be of no material benefit at all when we consider the best interests of the child. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I follow on from the remarks of Senator Vanstone and Senator Abetz and agree with the comments they have made in relation to Senator Spindler's proposed amendment. I think this would tend to open the floodgates on separate representation for children. Leaving aside applications for principal relief&mdash;namely, dissolution of marriage&mdash;we find that with ancillary applications the vast majority of cases involve children in one way or another. The vast majority of cases going to trial or involving disputations involve children. If they were to have separate representation there would be a cost problem and a problem which the legal profession itself, I venture to suggest, could not even meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that some of the problems one faces with separate representation for children is finding someone who is uniquely suited to represent the child. I note that Senator Spindler has included in his amendment personality, cultural background, training and experience and the fact that they must be suitably qualified. I can tell you that, in my experience with family law, if you applied that test to most family lawyers you would find them failing in one way or other on any one of those discrete grounds. It would be extremely difficult to come up with a lawyer who fitted the bill in all instances as mentioned in the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that aside, my experience with family law has revealed that there are only special instances where children need separate representation. In the vast majority of cases the matter is adequately dealt with by the two parties&mdash;that is, the mother and father, husband or wife&mdash;being represented. It is only during the course of the proceedings if something arises which indicates child abuse, some aspect of violence or something untoward that the court looks at separate representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, the current situation is suitable. I have been appointed to represent children and I can tell you that it is a very difficult task indeed. It is rather unusual you might think to have a practitioner who has no children of his own representing children. That was something which was brought home to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of cultural background, training and experience alone offer fantastic scope for questions to be applied in these instances. I once dealt with a family dispute involving a family of ethnic origin. If you had a solicitor of similar background, the rights of the women and the rights of the child would have been very much subjugated because one of the problems with this break-up was the fact that the female child was restricted severely in her freedom. There was one particular case recently which dealt with a father who plotted the murder of his own daughter because she would not accept his demands to abide by the rules of the household which were deep seated in a cultural and ethnic background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think you could run into problems with the personality alone, as Senator Abetz has mentioned. Who is to say that someone has had sufficient training to represent children. I have seen practitioners who I would have thought would have been eminently suited to represent children by their very disposition, but not necessarily because of their training. This does open a Pandora's box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this amendment is needed. I think that children are adequately protected within the framework of family law in this country. I think the courts are sufficiently vigilant in matters which touch on the welfare of children. I understand Senator Spindler's concern and I know that he has expressed on many occasions in this chamber a concern about the rights of children and the welfare of children, but I do not think that this proposal will work. I do not think it has the efficacy to succeed and therefore I oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to some of the comments that have been made. The arguments put forward by Senator Ellison that the court can handle it adequately rests on the assumption that the court will always know when there is a case that requires separate representation. I am not aware of any provisions which indicate that counsellors must always talk to children. We cannot assume that that will happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that, in most cases, the counselling is carried out between the two separating partners rather than with the children. It is therefore rather facile to say that the court can handle it, the court has handled it, the court will know what to do and the court has the discretion. The point is that the court may not know. The system may fail the children and it is simply to ensure that it does not that a representative is suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is equally facile to quibble with the suggested qualifications for the representative of the children. One should try to pick a representative that is suited to the task. Certainly, it is going to be difficult.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that Senator Vanstone has got some difficulty with interpreting the term `entitle'. She says children are entitled now. To me entitle means that I have the right to something. Children have not got the right to a representative at the moment. They get a representative when the court decides they should have one. If the court decides they should not have one then they do not get one. That right is not there. It seems to me that entitle means that you have that right, but children do not have that right at the moment. It is mandatory on the court to determine that.

<PARA>The amendment seeks to allow somebody to assess whether counselling is appropriate in all the circumstances. It is basically allowing a decision to be made by a counsellor. We believe that the cautionary principle in the provision under which a party to proceedings under the Family Law Act can seek a counselling session for the purposes of discussing child welfare, care and development should be asserted.

<PARA>I have moved the amendments together as a short cut to assist the process of the committee. They are not totally connected. Amendment No. 3 and Amendment No. 4 are associated with each other and they relate to the practical difficulties that arise when a parent who is providing accommodation moves interstate or overseas. While the Western Australian Family Court has taken this into account, recent case histories from the United Kingdom, where the distances are nothing like those in Western Australia, have made their way into decisions made by the court in other states. It is a trend for the court which stands in the way of the parent providing accommodation living wherever they wish, but it creates a very difficult balancing act between the freedom of parents to live where they choose and the rights of the child to have contact with both parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have done in amendment No. 3 is to relate the amendment to a parent as against a person in whose favour a contact order is in place, because it would be too great a limit on the other parent's freedom of movement if the provision extended to other people&mdash;for example, grandparents. The list could be endless as contact orders can be made in favour of any person concerned with a child's care, welfare and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 4 to clause 31, subsection 68F(2), is for the same reason. In many cases, a parent will move away from the other parent&mdash;that is a natural choice&mdash;but we believe that there should be some provisions which assist them. Therefore, we have inserted two clauses&mdash;amendments Nos 3 and 4. Amendment No. 3 says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, we probably would not need to have my amendment No. 1, but we will need it shortly so I will address it. The amendment incorporates the Convention on the Rights of the Child into the relevant part of the Family Law Act. The convention embodies three important principles: firstly, that children not be discriminated against, ensuring non-discrimination between children and between children and adults; secondly, that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration in decision making; and, thirdly, that the choice of the child be heard and given due weight. Who in this chamber would disagree with those principles? I am sure that none of us would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill will remove the capacity for those principles to be considered within decision making that might be involved in the bill that we are considering for debate today. This amendment is being moved to simply affirm in law what the common law has been saying since 1969: Australian citizens have a legitimate expectation that if Australia becomes party to an international treaty then we will conform to its provisions. Where a decision maker does not act in conformity, they must give notice and provide an opportunity for a person affected to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctrine of legitimate expectation is a very modest principle. It is very hard to fathom why the government wants to stamp it out. The only conclusion that we can draw is that the government wants to perpetrate the sham of being an upstanding international citizen in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly in this instance, while failing to honour its obligations as a result of that except at the whim of administrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Greens, the coalition and Democrats have pointed out, our treaty process is fundamentally flawed. We may believe this for different reasons. What we need here is a comprehensive approach to the debate and not a piecemeal approach. The opposition, in supporting the government's Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill, is allowing the government to have unbridled capacity or licence to sign international treaties with total impunity. It does not have to take into consideration the principles enshrined in those international treaties. We believe that, while administrators obviously would not be bound or obliged to fulfil those treaties unless they were enshrined in domestic law, they should have some obligation to consider those responsibilities, even if they then decide against them. That is the reason why this amendment is being put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big picture is that the government has really failed to create an adequate system for working towards implementation of our international obligations. The area of family law, specifically with regard to children, is a clear example of this. I particularly urge our opposition colleagues to reconsider the decision that they will be able to make. I would be quite happy for them not to support these particular amendments if I thought they were not going to pass the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill, because this amendment would then not be necessary&mdash;I quite agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would have a legitimate expectation that the international treaty obligations in connection with the rights of the child would have some sway in the decision making that would occur under the Family Law Reform Bill that we are discussing today. However, the community is becoming increasingly aware that the safety net that the international treaty has represented to all who are working in the area of the rights of children is going to be undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to read a copy of a letter which has been put out by Defence for Children International&mdash;Australia. It underlines the concern which has been expressed and is the reason for the amendment being brought to the chamber. It relates to the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill, the need for such an amendment and for those in the chamber to support it. The letter is to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge you to withdraw immediately the legislation to nullify the decision, known as the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that this Bill, and the executive statement issued by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 10 May, are a betrayal of the promise Australia made to children when it ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and signed the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in 1991. I note that this promise was repeated in commitments made by you in the National Action Plan for Human Rights (1994) and the Report "Our Children, Our Future" (1994).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I fully support this commitment and believe that Australia's children urgently need the protection of the international standards contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is a disgrace in the eyes of the world community and brings shame on Australia's human rights record. No longer will our representatives at the UN be able to claim that Australia is fully committed to implementing human rights and children's rights in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has clearly indicated that Australia's past position on international treaties is untenable. The proper response to this decision is not to nullify it but to develop legislation to implement it constructively and promptly . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That underlines the concern of many people in the community who had what is now being exposed as a false sense of security: that Australia's becoming a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child would have some protective function in administrative decision making, not&mdash;and I stress `not'&mdash;an obligation that it will have a force of law, but simply a legitimate expectation that those factors would be taken into consideration. Amendment No. 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"60BA.(1) Unless and until this section is expressly repealed, the fact that Australia is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child gives rise to a legitimate expectation, on the part of any person, that to any extent that this Part does anything less than implement the requirements of the Convention:</PARA>

<PARA>So it is simply giving a procedural right to people who feel that the spirit of the international treaty, to which Australia is a party, will be honoured in administrative decision making in the Family Law Reform Bill. That is not an unreasonable expectation whatsoever. In fact, I think the government is being utterly unreasonable in foreshadowing that it is not intending to take the natural consequence of its becoming a party to the treaty into account. </PARA>

I think the vast majority of middle road Australia&mdash;when I say `middle road', I think it would be 95-plus per cent of the population&mdash;would say that it is appropriate.

The children of Australia were not consulted before we signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The bureaucrats were consulted and certain lobby groups were consulted. Then we went around the cocktail circuit of international treaty making and we signed up. But the children were not consulted in establishing the convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to amendment No. 3, we understand the concern which underlies the proposed amendment. What we see here is an amendment which seeks to add to proposed subsection 68B(1) a new paragraph providing the court with, in effect, the power to circumscribe the freedom of movement of a person with whom the child lives&mdash;to restrain or to constrain that freedom of movement. We understand the underlying reasons for this particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of balance between parents is a difficult one. Balance between facilitating contact between the child and a non-resident parent and allowing the parent with whom the child lives to manage his or her life has always been difficult. The amendment, in the eyes of the government, will allow the court to issue an injunction which would constrain movement, for instance, of a parent fleeing violence. It would overtly place control over a place of residence of the parent. It would potentially restrain the parent from moving in order to obtain employment, to go on holidays, to visit relatives, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember that if there is a contact order, and a parent then removes a child, that parent will be in breach of that order and the enforcement provisions of the act can be invoked. So there is some protection. There is also a need to allow for flexibility for parents to run their own lives. We see this as being too restrictive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge that the enforcement of the orders by the Family Court was a source of complaint to the joint select committee. We do not think this amendment is a way to address the concerns that people had when going to the joint select committee. For instance, we would rather pursue the course of action kicked off by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">For the sake of the kids</EMPHASIS>. That report deals specifically with complex contact cases in the Family Court. It has considered the issue in detail. We would rather proceed down that route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now considering submissions that we have received in response to that Law Reform Commission report. We would rather treat the issue in a broader way in responding to that particular report&mdash;though we understand what Senator Chamarette wants to do&mdash;than go too far in potentially constraining people's movement. That is No. 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some problems with No. 4 as well. Once again I understand the motivation. To the extent that anything needs to be done here, we think this particular amendment is not necessary. The amendment refers to the child's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis. This description is somewhat inconsistent with the principle contained in paragraph 60B(2)(b). It would undermine the amendment to the principle recommended by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That amendment qualified that right of the child by recognising that contact through the proviso `except if the contact is contrary to the child's best interest'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We maintain that there needs to be flexibility to accommodate the child's best interests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand the motivation for the amendments, but we think they are excessive. For instance, amendment No. 4 is directed at the consideration of the practicalities and expense of contact by a child or parent. It is not quite clear what sort of result is intended from that consideration. If contact is difficult or expensive, should it therefore not be ordered?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do think those amendments are too restrictive, and we would rather pursue balancing the rights of the child than just accept amendment No. 4.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the minister is in relation to a reconciliation of the principles expressed in 60B, in particular subclause (2), which deals with the principles underlying the object of part VII dealing with children. One principle is that children have a right of contact on a regular basis with both parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 68F says how a court determines what is in a child's best interests. Subclause (2) lists various criteria: the wishes of the child, the relationship of the child with each of its parents and the likely effect of the separation, as well as other matters. But none of them specifically addresses the right of the child to have regular contact with either parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to me that the Greens' amendment (da) addresses this very important point, when it says that the court should be mindful of the practical difficulty that a parent might have in getting access to a child. That is the reciprocal of the right of the child to have regular contact with a parent. Regular contact would imply that the parent and child can get together regularly. Of course, if there is the tyranny of distance&mdash;which this country of ours knows only too well&mdash;there might be a problem in getting such regular contact. How does the minister reconcile that object in 60B(2)(b), and what is his argument for excluding the Greens' amendment No. 4?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are pleased that amendment No. 4 of the Greens will probably be passed by the chamber. We certainly will support it. We also support amendment No. 3. Both of these amendments touch on areas of great difficulty with people that have gone through the traumatic experience of separating and having to achieve some sort of continuing contact with their children. In the three family law inquiries, of which I have been a part, many witnesses told quite horrendous stories about the difficulty that they have experienced in maintaining that contact. Therefore, I am very pleased to express the Democrats' support for amendment No. 3 and for amendment No. 4 as amended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats also support strongly amendment No. 1, which relates to the Convention on the Rights of the Child that Australia has both signed and ratified. The convention contains a simple but, I would have thought, extremely principled statement suggesting that we are obliged to provide protection and support for our children, that we are obliged to ensure that they are not exposed to violence, that their material needs are adequately catered for and that they are given a voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it somewhat ironic when Senator Abetz said that the children have not been asked for their views before the government signed and ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It did so after consultation with the state governments. At the same time, Senator Abetz does not think children should have a voice in family law proceedings before the Family Court. On the one hand, he says that we should consult children but, on the other hand, he is quite prepared to deny them separate representation which would give them an effective voice in court proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Abetz that at least 21,000 cases of physical and sexual abuse of children in Australia are substantiated every year.

It is somewhat ironic that, when we have an international convention that we have signed and ratified which tries to establish adequate standards for the protection of Australian children as well as children across the world, this is causing such difficulty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I think it is a wise idea to take amendment No. 4 separately, and I support that suggestion by Senator Chamarette. I want to address the WA Greens' amendments in toto.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Family Law Act 1975 with these amendments adequately sets out a comprehensive regime dealing with the welfare of children and what is considered to be the best interests of children. The people of Australia are sufficiently well served by this legislation without having to resort to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to achieve any further equality, justice or advancement of the welfare of children. As such, we will only complicate matters by referring to a convention which is not drafted with the particularity and clarity of the legislation that we have before us. In general terms, conventions and treaties by their very nature have to be so drafted because they are dealing with many parties coming from many different parts of the world. A good many treaties and conventions are stated in terms of general principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you apply that to the internal workings of a country, to the domestic law of a country, you can run into all sorts of trouble, particularly where there is already comprehensive legislation dealing with a subject anyway. I believe it is more appropriate that the people of Australia decide through their elected representatives what is best for them rather than having the executive determine that by signing an international instrument. With the legislative process that we have, we have a very good system whereby the people of Australia can lobby their elected representatives, those representatives are subject to scrutiny and legislation is subject to scrutiny; that is, the people get what the people want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the case with conventions and international instruments. I do not see any prejudice at all in not adopting the Greens' amendment. I think it takes it no further. Any expectation which has to be created should be created in the legislation that we have before us and the bill as it will be passed&mdash;no more, no less. That is where the people of Australia have to look for their expectations, and I therefore oppose amendment No. 1. </PARA>

The comments I made to Senator Chamarette were on the basis of her comment that not incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was in effect a breach of promise to the children of this country.

The last time we had a little fulmination on this subject was on 16 October, when there was a similar exchange across the table. I sat here for the duration of the following question time. The first question that came to me from the opposition was 55 minutes into question time. It was the only question for that day. Yesterday, in the very week that you are getting so excited about the need for my presence, I sat here for an hour and not one single question was directed towards me; not one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I might say, Mr President, after the diatribe from Senator Gareth Evans, he might like to return to the real world. Noting the mining unions involved in the Weipa dispute having defied the orders of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the ACTU backing them in this illegal act, I ask: does the government condone the trade union bosses' defiance of the Industrial Relations Commission?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will be aware, award employees have been on strike since 13 October over the use of individual contracts at Comalco's Weipa bauxite and kaolin operations. Reports indicate that there is a discrepancy of up to $20,000 between the wages of those on individual contracts and award employees. We are aware of claims that the company is actively de-unionising its work force and requiring every worker to sign away his or her rights of collective bargaining in order to achieve a wage increase. We would be concerned if those claims are true. We are concerned that the principles of collective bargaining, which underpin our industrial system, be preserved. We are also concerned that individual contracts not be used to de-unionise or to discriminate against unions members. They are the principles that we are concerned about; they are the issues that we are concerned about in this case.

We are concerned that the principles of collective bargaining be maintained. They have traditionally underpinnned our industrial relations system. We do not want to see them undermined in the future. We do not want to see individual contracts being used to de-unionise or discriminate against union members.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Over the last few months there has been a great deal of discussion on the wool market situation, particularly in relation to the importance of China in the market.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased with the positive response from the industry to the government's decision to allow Wool International to conduct a limited two-year program to develop and evaluate the forward marketing of wool. The industry must develop the commercial tools to manage risk. An acceptance of this by industry is fundamental to its future. In this regard I was pleased to see that the Commonwealth Bank announced yesterday its intention to establish a $330 million credit facility for China to purchase Australian wool. The Commonwealth Bank is already involved in financing the wool trade with China. This is a very welcome initiative, coupled with the predicted falls in wool production to the lowest levels since 1982-83 and industry evidence that I have been given in the last two weeks that wool stocks in Chinese bond stores have now fallen significantly and the fact that Wool International has less than 20,000 bales to sell by the end of this year to meet its fixed disposal schedule. This financing initiative may give some added impetus to the current market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the Australian agricultural sector in general is now beginning to recover from the drought affected situation of 1994-95. Given the market fundamentals, wool should again take its place in that recovery. My latest advice from ABARE is that net value of farm production is forecast to rise by 81 per cent to $4 billion in 1995-96. This will be the highest level in real terms since the late 1980s. The value of farm exports is forecast to rise by around $1.3 billion to $19 billion in 1995-1996. Again, this is the highest since the late 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE expects the most significant improvement in the cropping sector. This season, total winter grain production is forecast to be 27 million tonnes, some 88 per cent up on 1994-95. Wheat production is forecast to rebound to 16.7 million tonnes in 1995-96, 85 per cent higher than the severely drought affected 1994-95 crop. At the same time, importantly, with these significant production improvements, the world prices for grain remain favourable due to falling world grain stocks, which suggest that Australians growers will obtain a good return for this larger crop.</PARA>

The claim we are concerned about is that there not be discrimination against union members.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to know that we have a process since the Baume inquiry that requires us through the Therapeutic Goods Authority to accept an application for approval of drugs, and that is usually in confirmation with the European format. But we make it clear that Australia retains the responsibility to do its own assurances by examining the data, and so on. We do not take the approval in other countries for medications without very close appraisal of our own. This is, I think, a very important matter for Australian sovereignty in this area, the reputation we have established, and also to be able to assure people that if it is approved in Australia it has been rigorously examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly take account of approval in other countries, but it is not the process or the practice to accept carte blanche that if it is approved somewhere else Australia will approve it. We will not resile from that. We have that concern to make sure that Australian processes stand the test, stand rigorous appraisal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the drugs saquinavir and 3TC, I have some detail here, Senator. The usual time from application for approval until finalisation of approval within the TGA is about 255 days. That is the time that people aim for, but in fact the usual time is about 160 days. In other words, we have speeded up the process, sometimes even to 125 days. Drugs of the sort that you have mentioned that demonstrate potential for effectively treating serious or life threatening conditions indeed take priority through the TGA process and sometimes can be turned around in 125 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised that the application for 3TC, which was not lodged until late July this year, is likely to be considered by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee at its first meeting next year, which means the total time for review will be in the order of six to seven months. The application for saquinavir was only lodged with the TGA late last month. Again, it has been under review by the FDA for several months prior to being lodged in Australia. The pharmaceutical benefits branch of the department has been informed that TGA has assigned priority to both 3TC and saquinavir applications so that it can anticipate a speedy referral to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee once it has gone through the TGA and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do take these very seriously, Senator.

<PARA>I am not sure whether Senator Evans actually did provide an answer to Senator Parer's question, but I have moved that we take note of the answer anyway. This government is beholden to the ACTU and the trade union movement. That is why the government during question time today failed to refuse to condone the trade unions' defiance of the Industrial Relations Court. If the government wants to tell us that its system of industrial relations in this country is so good&mdash;the system that it has implemented&mdash;it should have the courage to stand up and say that the decisions of that court ought be abided by by the trade union movement. </PARA>

We had no clearer example of that than in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> in my home state of Tasmania. The new Tasmanian union chief, Lyn Fitzgerald, flexed her political muscle and told a very small gathering&mdash;I must say it was an embarrassingly small gathering&mdash;of Labor Party supporters in the text of her address of `the detailed union priorities for women in work and what the Labor Party would do in this area if it wins office'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we had the President of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council announcing on behalf of the Australian Labor Party what Labor would do if it were to win office. That is why the government is unable today to come out and say that it does not condone the behaviour of the trade union movement, that it will call upon the trade union movement to behave in a responsible way. For it to do so would be to defy the funders of the trade union movement and to defy the people who endorsed most of the Labor people on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kelty is reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> as taking off the gloves and saying, `To be beaten on this one is for the union movement to lose its heart, soul and purpose.' Well, that is a great surprise to the vast majority of workers in this country, because the trade union movement has never had a heart, has never had a soul and has lost its purpose a long time ago. That is why the workers of this country are leaving the trade union movement in absolute droves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the workers are given a choice they leave the trade union movement. That is why the Labor Party senators over there are so concerned with our policy of giving workers choice. By giving the workers choice, do you know what we are in fact doing? If they no longer had to pay their compulsory trade union fee, in rough terms that would be equivalent to a $6 a week pay increase to each one of those workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here the government talks about an $8 a week safety net wage increase. They could deliver that to the workers of this country by simply saying, `We will no longer allow compulsory trade unionism.' But the Labor Party is scared of giving choice to the workers because they know what the workers will do. The workers will leave the trade union movement because they get better deals under enterprise bargaining than they do under the centralised award system. The workers know that. That is why they are moving in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Labor Party and the trade union movement are desperately trying to regain the confidence of the workers. That is why they got rid of Martin Ferguson&mdash;told him to go into the parliament&mdash;to get Jennie George to assist. But I have to say that Jennie George was able to attract only about 200 people to a rally in Western Australia, which is hardly the sort of inspiring confidence that the trade union movement needs. If they want to get the confidence of the workers again, if they want to get support from the workers, I suggest that they make unionism voluntary, stop being henchmen for the ALP and in bed with the ALP and look after the interests of the workers rather than the interests of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that culture changes, then I believe the economy will be a lot better off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, Senator Abetz has demonstrated his absolute lack of any understanding of industrial relations in this country and in particular any understanding of the history of the Weipa dispute. The position is that, for a number of years now, the CRA company and a number of its subsidiaries have set out on a deliberate course to de-unionise their work sites. They took that action not as a result of any industrial disputation or any problems with the unions but simply because they hate unions. The management of CRA has set out to get rid of trade unions off their sites.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give you an instance. In 1990, one of the subsidiaries of the CRA company, Peak Hill goldmine, negotiated a consent award with the Australian Workers Union for one of its goldmines in New South Wales near Cobar. In fact, its general manager praised that award as being one of the most forward thinking modern awards under the new industrial relations provisions. But within 12 months, what did the CRA subsidiary company do? It went around and convinced its employees, after holding three or four secret ballots with no advice to the union whatsoever, that they should resign from the union. On what basis? They offered them a bribe. The bribe was to give them huge pay increases in return for giving up any right to collective bargaining or any right to unionisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the CRA company has set out to do. It has not been about productivity. It has not been about enterprise bargaining. The individual contracts that have been imposed upon workers through the CRA company by virtue of basic blackmail are not in any way, shape or form enterprise bargaining. If you hold to that view, Senator Abetz, it demonstrates your total lack of any understanding of what enterprise bargaining is in this country, what collective bargaining is in this country and how the award system operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were longstanding awards in place covering the operations of Comalco at Weipa and at each of the other CRA sites. But what was the CRA's view about those awards? Ignore them. Forget the fact that they existed. Forget that there were processes through the Industrial Relations Commission in order to negotiate enterprise agreements and in order to negotiate or, indeed, have arbitrated changes to the awards. No, the CRA company said, `We will buy off the workers with huge pay increases. But, more importantly, we will discriminate against those workers who will not take the bait.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a long period of time, CRA wore down quite a lot of workers. But there is a group of workers at Weipa who have refused to buckle under and who have refused to accept those draconian conditions that if you want a wage increase you can't have a union represent you and if you accept that wage increase you hand over for all time to the company the right to set your wages and working conditions. That is the sort of attitude you are supporting in this country today by the actions of CRA. There is a group of workers up there who are fighting with the only weapon they have left&mdash;that is, their labour&mdash;to stand up for a fundamental democratic principle that they will not be discriminated against and that they will not be forced to do the same work but accept $20,000 a year less simply because they want to remain members of a trade union and to be represented by a trade union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of CRA throughout this entire dispute&mdash;which did not start yesterday as Senator Abetz seems to think but which started two years ago&mdash;have been an affront and an attack upon the fundamental democratic principles of this country. They are the sorts of principles that unions like Solidarity in Poland and COSATU in South Africa fought for and people gave their lives to protect. That is a fundamental principle of democracy&mdash;that organised labour and workers can have access to organisations such as trade unions to protect their rights. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The facts are that the workers there are not on strike because they are fighting for collective bargaining, as the ACTU and the Labor Party would have you believe. The truth is that there was very little separating the workers from the management the other weekend. The difference was simply a question of representation in negotiations. It was not on the basis that the workers wanted collective bargaining; they wanted somebody to have a chance to represent them.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is fact one. Fact number two is that the company was quite happy to have those people come back to work. There was no problem there. Fact number three is that the company was quite happy to have those people belong to a union. This is not a battle where the company is trying to drive people out of unions.

I understand the concern that the workers may have in that regard. If it had not been for the intervention of Mr Pallas perhaps this situation would have been sorted out. Instead, what happened was the ACTU&mdash;Senator Murphy's mates and Senator Forshaw's mates; all the vested interests on the other side of the chamber&mdash;came in and said, `Brothers, this is a fight for collective bargaining.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that it would be very nice if people on the opposition benches really understood the issue. If they did, they would not talk such rubbish. Those opposite talk about the history of the trade union movement as if they know why it came into existence, as if they know what people in the leadership and the rank and file think, and as if they know what it is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, as the president of the metalworkers union in Queensland for many years, had responsibilities in areas of construction. On many occasions I successfully negotiated  two-year contracts and agreements to ensure that both sides received the advantages of reasonable industrial peace while the contract was in existence. They were collective contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in the 1960s and the 1970s when the mother lode was found and Weipa first came into existence it was recognised that there was a need to do something about establishing an award. The company at that time was quite happy to sit down and put forward some of its demands as to what should be contained in that document. The unions did likewise. A construction agreement came into being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years it worked quite well. There were some small disputes as a result of, for instance, 1,000 workers on the job and no doctor being available. A sister had to take care of the workers' health and deal with accidents that might occur. There were really no arguments about wages and conditions. With the commencement of production of aluminium and the beneficiation of the bauxite another award was necessary. That award contained an area which catered for construction workers. For many years there was not much construction work carried out in that area. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of other agreements were negotiated in Queensland in areas such as coalmine construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the odd occasion of their finding some kaolin they had to then carry out some construction and build a small refinery. People were required to go there from other sites. Comalco, which is the company that has now been able to bring into being contract arrangements with individuals of some hundreds, even though they have not done it for everyone, had an award in an area for construction which was miles behind everyone else. Then they had a strike on their hands because when people worked in other areas they found themselves to be $50 and $60 a week behind everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke with the company and we set out to try to do something within the award to give those people some wage justice, even though we might not have been able to give them everything they had been getting everywhere else. As a result of that, I journeyed up there and talked for a long time with the people whom I represented, including a number of other unions, and with the company. We both agreed to go into that area and vary the award in a very modest way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that, there were always periodic negotiations, about every two years, on areas of production in relation to aluminium and refineries around Australia. There had been no real hassles but all of a sudden we found that Comalco, through the agency of CRA, and others decided they wanted to have people on individual contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People said this new idea of individual contracts was trying to take us back 100 years. The Tolpuddle Martyrs back in the 1800s were sent out here because they dared to get together and ask their farmer employers collectively for a wage increase from about tenpence to a shilling a day. They got sent out here for 15 years. It might have been more pleasant to live out here except they were away from their families, but they were sent out here because they dared to bargain collectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that time onwards, from the 1900s, the trade union movement grew and was able to collectively bargain and to put in place arbitrated awards. Now the company sees an opportunity to make an offer of some $20,000 a year to more people if they will make individual agreements. Senator O'Chee talked about talking to the shop steward who represented them. When you make a collective agreement you do it one on one, you do not need a shop steward. All your problems will be attended to by you and by the company.

It is important that we look quite rationally and from a factual point of view at the issue raised in the question. With regard to the Weipa situation and CRA you have to look back at history in my own state where the company CRA sought to implement individual contracts. It did so in a way that I do not think any Australian person, even those on the other side of the chamber, would support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For three years the unions representing workers at that site sought to negotiate with the employer for wage increases that were consistent with the accord agreement. For three years those workers at that site did not get a wage increase. The company then turned around and offered wage increases of between $8,000 and $13,000 per employee but it did so on the basis that they would sign up on an individual contract, that they would not be a member of a union and that they would basically remove all their rights with regard to any national wage increases that may come on. There were no rights to that. They had an individual contract and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a ballot. I know the opposition has a position as to how ballots ought to be conducted&mdash;that is, they ought to be secret ballots. It was a secret ballot, and 80 per cent of the people rejected the offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was against that background that the company thought about it and said, `Okay, we will go about this another way.' They came up with a different offer and basically told people that if they did not like or accept it, the company would seek other people to do the job. In such times of high unemployment, that scared people&mdash;nobody would disagree with that; we have to acknowledge it. I do not think that is the Australian way of negotiating employment. We ought to have a fairer system, the one the government has sought to implement. It is one on which the government has a very proud record. We have sought to have an industrial relations system that allows people in small business to negotiate individually and, more importantly, it guarantees people the right to be able to be represented collectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What CRA have done at Weipa is choose a course of action that seeks to exclude that right. Even the opposition leader, Mr Howard, has said on many occasions that he supports the right of people to choose to be represented collectively. So it is fundamentally wrong for you to come in here and question the government on its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I say that essentially this matter ought to be resolved by the Industrial Relations Commission. They have sought to do that and there is a process in place. It is my understanding that if the Industrial Relations Commission makes a finding a certain way, the government may well intervene in the dispute. With regard to compliance with the Industrial Relations Commission's decisions, I have had some personal experience with another company, namely North Broken Hill Peko. I took two cases to the Industrial Relations Commission as the secretary of the timber workers union. I won both those cases against the company fairly and squarely. They were caught with the underpayment of workers whom they had stood down illegally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company refused to pay them and said it would fight the matter in the court. It was only a very small state branch of the union that I was representing. We did not have the financial capacity to pursue that claim. To this day, that decision has not been honoured and the company has never paid those workers. It is very clear, in terms of Australian workers, that this is the very reason we have to have an industrial relations system that has fairness and equity in it for all sides. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The company concerned has complied meticulously with the act; it has not broken the law in any way. It has offered under the act the opportunity for individual work agreements. As a consequence of these individual agreements, it has had increased productivity; it has been able to pay those employees more. The lazy, loafing bully boys in the union movement do not like it. It was quite wrong for Senator Forshaw to get up and say that the company had penalised the workers who did not join the enterprise agreement. That was not true. They are paid at the level that the union negotiated for them. They are paid their award; the law is being complied with. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A request for leave to make a personal explanation under standing order 190 does not have to be based on a claim to have been misrepresented. The standing order specifies only that a senator may request leave to explain matters of a personal nature and such matters may not be debated. Senators habitually ask for leave under standing order 190 on the basis that they have been misrepresented and the leave is granted on that basis. If you seek to make a personal explanation under standing order 190 in the future, I suggest that you indicate the nature of the explanation that you seek to make.</PARA>
<PARA>In accordance with what I judge to be very sound advice, I have sought leave within those terms.

If Senator Crichton-Browne is seeking leave, the leave will be given only in these terms; that is, to explain matters of a personal nature, for a period of five minutes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill, which is a near duplicate of the private member's bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. We are debating this bill simply because the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, introduced his bill into the House of Representatives. He introduced it because of the total mistrust of the people of Sydney in regard to the actions by this government that has resulted in the problems at Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill highlights the total disaster that is the government's Sydney airport policy. It did it all on its own. The government has ruined the lives of thousands of Sydney residents by closing the east-west runway and concentrating the noise generated by the airport north and south of Kingsford Smith airport. Since that time the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, has come up with a whole range of half thought through policy initiatives in an attempt to reduce the noise generated by the airport. I might say most of them were peripheral and some of them have been plain stupid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One in particular was a proposal by the minister for the landing aircraft to have a six degree flight path coming in to land. This was totally rejected not only by the pilots, who refused to accept it on safety grounds, but also by his own Airservices Australia. The minister is so lacking in imagination that he has now resorted to plagiarising a bill drafted by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. Mr Brereton described Mr Howard's bill as a `stunt'&mdash;a brave word from a minister who was not prepared even to consider entrenching the curfew in legislation until he was trumped by the Liberal-National coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney Airport Curfew Bill would ensure that the curfew could not be altered without adequate consultation and debate. It would also implement a number of minor alterations to the curfew. The Howard bill proposed to make a number of changes to the curfew system. The bill would have forced the Minister for Transport to consult widely before altering the curfew. The reason for this, as I mentioned earlier, is that the thousands and thousands of people of Sydney who have been badly affected do not trust this government any more. In addition, it would have required the minister to table in the parliament any exceptional circumstances dispensations that he or she made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government referred the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for an advisory report. The whole aim of this, of course, was to take away the thrust of the fact that the bill had been initiated by Mr John Howard. The committee endorsed the bill but proposed a range of representations, some of which appear in this bill introduced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is necessary because of the hundreds of thousands of Sydney residents who do not trust this government. They do not trust the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and they do not trust Mr Brereton. They know, claim and believe that they have been lied to and deceived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residents of Sydney were rightly concerned that the minister could alter the curfew regulations without consultation. They feared that the government might decide to alter the curfew arrangements. Who could blame them, when the best response the minister could give to the residents was that `they will have to learn to live with it'. That was his response to the complaints by those people to the north of Kingsford Smith airport. Who could blame them, given the government's sorry history of misleading and deceiving people about the effects that the construction of the third runway and the closure of the cross runway would have on their lives. It is no wonder the battlers of Australia are fed up with this uncaring and arrogant government which has clearly shown that it is out of touch with the vast majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deceptions began in 1989 when the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and Mr Keating ducked, weaved and compromised to get the decision through cabinet. It is worth quoting from the autobiography of ex-Senator Graham Richardson, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only a matter of days before the first Cabinet discussion, Hawke and Keating had given assurances that they were opposed to a third runway and we were entitled to believe them. When Gary Punch and I held a press conference to dispel rumours that the Government would consider building a third runway, we did so after seeking yet another assurance from Hawke. Keating was making the same noises, so we went into these Cabinet discussions feeling pretty confident. But a funny thing happened on the way to the forum, and to this day I have no idea what it was.</PARA>
<PARA>What happened is that somewhere along the way they all got mugged, and the leader of the group that did the mugging is the current Prime Minister. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which was on the drip at the time, reported that Mr Keating came up with the idea of closing the east-west runway. His suggestion answered many of the political objections to the runway project, because it meant the noise impact on seats like Barton and St George would be reduced. Of course, it meant sacrificing the people who lived to the north of the airport, but they were dispensable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residents of Sydney were also misled about the runways that would be used once the parallel runway was opened and about the number of people who would be adversely affected by the noise. The environmental impact statement forecast that prevailing winds would mean that the aircraft could take off to the north only 12.8 per cent of the time. During the 11 months since the third runway was opened, it has become clear that the EIS forecast was a gross underestimate. In the first month of the runway's operations, 38.2 per cent of departures were to the north compared with the forecast figure of 12.8 per cent. The government initially blamed unusually strong summer winds, but it has become clear as the seasons have gone past that the 12.8 per cent figure was a gross underestimate. We now have more than double the number of planes taking off to the north than predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government, because it is remote, arrogant and out of touch, has underestimated the effect of this disgraceful debacle. It claims over and over again that under the flawed system fewer people are seriously and moderately affected. It claims that this issue is about a handful of voters in Hunters Hill. That is typical of the sort of line being run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of people who are affected by aircraft noise is not a handful of people in Hunters Hill. It is the battlers who live in suburbs like Leichhardt, Marrickville, Drummoyne, Annandale, Haberfield and so on&mdash;the true believers; the Labor heartland. They are the vast majority of people who have been affected. Yet the minister says that the only reason the opposition is complaining is a handful of voters in Hunters Hill. Nothing could be further from the truth. A cursory look at today's crazy flight paths would soon dispel this notion. It is interesting to have a look at the flight paths. This page shows a typical flight path arrangement that now occurs at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days I have noticed that a new group has set itself up in parts of Sydney. It has looked at those sorts of figures and has said that they are disturbed that, with the new flight paths that have been introduced by the government, instead of aeroplanes flying over the least populated areas&mdash;whether it be to the south or the east&mdash;they are now going over some 60 kilometres of suburbs&mdash;60 kilometres of built-up Sydney are now being traversed by aircraft noise in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airservices Australia argues that about 75,000 people are affected by aircraft noise. That figure dramatically underestimates the number of people who are affected. It does not take into account many other areas that are affected by noise, such as Kuring-gai. There are serious flaws in the way that figure was calculated. In fact, no-one who was outside what they call the 20 ANEF contour zone was included. That is where the government has made a major mistake. Evidence put to our committee from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital suggests that there may well be somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 people seriously and moderately affected by this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage of the bill to require the government to reopen the east-west runway. The reason for that is that reopening the east-west runway would give Airservices Australia the flexibility to strike an appropriate balance between the competing ends of noise, safety and capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has continued along this path of deceiving the residents of Sydney by advancing three myths about the east-west runway. The first myth was that the runway was closed on safety grounds. Prior to November 1994 there were two active runways at Sydney: a main north-south runway and a crossing east-west runway. The latter was built in 1954 as the original jet runway. Both were active runways. At that stage, while there were certainly complaints, there was not a major noise problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 4 November 1994, there were three runways, but only one and seven-eighths were active: the main north-south runway and the new runway, but take-offs to the north were not permitted. The east-west runway was closed except for exceptional circumstances. This prompted incredible outrage, blockades and demonstrations&mdash;led, I might say, by leading Labor figures such as the Mayor of Marrickville, Mr Barry Cotter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bob Collins, who represents Minister Brereton in this place, and I were on a Senate committee inquiry into the Sydney airport in 1988. He would know that the presentation made to that committee by the Federal Airports Corporation proposed a medium spaced parallel runway, but it was never envisaged that we would end up with fewer than two runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the proposal in 1988 was that the MANS committee back in 1982 or 1983 had recommended what is called a narrow spaced runway or a closed spaced runway. The reason why the FAC recommended the medium spaced runway was that the narrow spaced runway produced what is called wake turbulence. In other words, a big jet coming in could cause wake turbulence for a lighter plane coming in behind it. This can cause all sorts of problems, including turning the lighter plane on its side. Not so long ago, even without the east-west runway, an incident happened in the air because of wake turbulence. But the reason for the proposal by the FAC back in 1988 was that with a medium spaced runway we could have better capacity and we would not have the wake turbulence problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to close the east-west runway was a political decision. I do not think anyone would dispute that. In fact, that has been confirmed over and over again. The CAA, the FAC and the air traffic controllers have all confirmed that the decision to close the runway was a decision by government and that safety was not a significant issue. Last month, one of ex-Senator Graham Richardson's former advisers gave evidence. He confirmed that safety was not seriously considered to be an issue in any cabinet submission on the construction of the parallel runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the minister when he responds to produce a shred of evidence to show that safety was a significant consideration when that decision was made. Getting the public sector to come out with statements will not work, because they are doing exactly what they are supposed to do&mdash;they are supporting government policy. I do not criticise them for that; I just recognise the realism of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airlines themselves have no option but to support government policy. It is not helped when the minister, who has a reputation for being one of the great kneecappers in politics in this country, is known to have said some weeks before the airlines came out with a joint press release, `I am going to get the airlines singing my tune.' So there is a lack of credibility in those sorts of things, and everyone is aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second myth the government is putting about is that it would be unsafe&mdash;although it tends to have gone soft on this in recent times because the original policy decision did not refer to that. The Prime Minister demonstrated his lamentable ignorance of the issue by asserting, `If we seek to try to have traffic on the east-west runway across two parallel runways the result will be a dramatic collision.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had cross-runways operating at Sydney airport for 40 years. Minister Collins came in here in about 1991, I believe, saying that it was perfectly safe. Suddenly, it is unsafe. The other thing is that the Prime Minister&mdash;perhaps he has been away too long from his home town of Sydney&mdash;did not realise that the cross-runway does not cross both the parallel runways, only the old north-south. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airline pilots&mdash;domestic and international&mdash;do not believe there is a safety problem. In fact, the regional airlines claim that the current system where planes cross in the sky over north Sydney with 1,000 feet separation is less safe than crossing runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We even had the new chief executive-elect of Airservices Australia on a radio interview claiming that there was no particular problem with cross-runways, until of course he was nobbled. Then he had to change his tune. They got onto him pretty fast. It all happened within about 12 hours. I have had international pilots phone me in disgust, pointing out that because of what is happening at Sydney we are becoming the laughing stock of the world. To claim that the old configuration is dangerous is nothing short of ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third myth concerns the capacity implications of reopening the east-west runway. There is considerable argument about the peak capacity of Sydney airport. It depends on the configuration that is used and, of course, the weather. There are many permutations and combinations in using a runway system. The air traffic controllers at Sydney airport are now achieving rates of around 60 movements per hour, which is approximately the same rate they were able to achieve before the east-west runway was closed. The opening of the new control tower and the use of simultaneous approaches will increase the capacity to about 80 movements per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not been able to decide which line to take on the capacity implications of reopening the east-west runway. The Prime Minister has said that reopening the east-west runway would decrease the capacity of the airport by 35 per cent. One of his ministers said that it would increase the capacity of the airport. In fact, Minister Brereton said that if the sale of airports is delayed, there will be many more planes coming into Sydney. They cannot have it both ways. One of them has to be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertion that reopening the east-west runway would decrease the capacity of the airport by 35 per cent is clearly wrong. A 35 per cent decrease in the capacity of the airport would decrease the movement rate to 55 movements per hour, which would put it back below what it was when there were only two active runways. It is drawn from a hypothetical runway configuration that Airservices submitted simply to show the worst case scenario. The option is not the most efficient way that they put up of using three runways, as Airservices demonstrated later in answers to questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued that the use of all three runways will increase the capacity of the airport. So we have someone arguing that it will decrease and now they are going to argue that it will increase. Flight Transportation Associates from Massachusetts&mdash;they are world experts in the field&mdash;in their report on Sydney airport's capacity, estimated that the use of a three-runway configuration would increase the capacity to over 80 flights per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the minister cannot decide who he wants to frighten. He cannot decide whether he wants to frighten the users of the airport, by telling them that reopening the runway will decrease the capacity, or the people who live around the airport, by telling them that reopening the runway will increase the capacity of the airport. The minister will say whatever it takes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's objective is simple. It is to give Airservices Australia the flexibility to use all three runways to achieve an appropriate balance between three competing objectives&mdash;the equitable distribution of noise, safety and the capacity of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney Airport Curfew Bill is a welcome piece of legislation. The government has had 12 1/2 years to do something about this matter. It was not an issue until the problems created by this government surfaced in Sydney. Then it became an issue because the people in those areas, particularly in the north and south of the airport at Kurnell, have got to the stage where they do not trust this government on anything it does in relation to Sydney. So the only way to do something was to put this regulation into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason the government took any action at all was because the opposition leader, Mr Howard, introduced a private member's bill on the issue. He did that because the government is out of touch with the people, it is out of touch with the ideas of the people and it is out of touch with the aspirations of the people who have been so badly affected by the decision. It will soon be out of office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his concluding remarks Senator Parer claimed that the Sydney airport curfew only became an issue in recent times. I recall the obituary speeches for the late Fred Daly who, I remind the Senate, was the first member for the electorate of Grayndler. In his very early speeches in the early 1950s he drew the attention of the parliament to the problems of residents living in his and surrounding electorates who were affected by aircraft noise. For years and years Mr Daly and other members of the Labor Party&mdash;then in opposition&mdash;pleaded with the then conservative governments to do something about solving the problems with Sydney airport, but nothing was done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get today? We get opportunism, cynicism, and a total disregard of history from the opposition on this issue. We get desperate attempts by the opposition, through the medium of the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), to try and scrounge some credibility on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney Airport Curfew Bill 1995 is a watershed in the management of aircraft noise over Sydney. For the first time the curfew restrictions devised to improve conditions for Sydney residents will be enshrined in law. For the first time the restrictions will be progressively tightened, leading to further improvements over time. These changes will be institutionalised in the overall Sydney airport management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has done more to resolve the problems of Sydney airport, its congestion, and its noise, than the opposition has ever thought of doing. There is no doubt that the new third runway constructed at Sydney airport has brought problems with noise. The government does not run away from that. Senator Parer knows full well that during the deliberations of the inquiry of which he and I are members, I and other members of the government have not been afraid to address that issue head on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let no-one think that the opposition has clean hands on the issue of the devastating effect that aircraft noise can have on Sydney residents living under the flight path. Almost three years ago the opposition was in complete disarray over the issue of a curfew at Sydney airport. The member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the then shadow spokesperson on these matters, proposed that the curfew be lifted completely and that we have 24-hour operations at Sydney airport. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) agreed. This is all recorded and is well known to members of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then member for Lowe, now Senator Woods, disagreed. He threw his arms up in horror because he knew the impact that 24-hour operation of Sydney airport would have upon the electors of Lowe. The electors, of course, were sensible enough to turf him out of office at the last election. Throughout this period the opposition's position has been opportunistic and cynical in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a clear and comprehensive program for dealing with the airport problem in Sydney. Firstly, the new runway is relieving the problem of congestion. With the introduction of the new radar system that congestion will be even further alleviated. The parallel runway system now in operation at Mascot Airport is safer than the two old intersecting runways, namely the north-south and east-west runways. There is no doubt that it is a safer operation. All the experts agreed and testified to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also fast-tracking construction of the Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. This government is tackling an issue that the coalition had neither the courage nor the vision to take up when it was in government for over 30 of 33 years from 1949 to 1983. It took a Labor government to finally grasp the nettle, bite the bullet, and commence construction of Sydney's second airport. It was long talked about, but nothing was ever done by the present opposition when it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also devised a range of measures to ameliorate the problem of noise. The latest element in that very comprehensive program is this current bill, which will give teeth and strength to the regulatory curfew that has applied at Sydney now for some time. This stands in stark contrast to the grandstanding by the Leader of the Opposition, who sought in his own bill merely to take a system that had operated by regulation at Sydney airport and put it into an act. What a master stroke of cynicism that was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were no advances or no improvements, it was just a stunt. He thinks he can just take the existing law applied through regulation, change its name, make it an act, claim credit and hopefully convince the suffering electors in Bennelong that he has some credibility on this issue. There was nothing new, nothing stronger, nothing better, nothing original or brave and nothing genuine in the Leader of the Opposition's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been the innovator in Australian policy in respect of the airport needs of Sydney and other cities. It has been prepared to tackle this difficult issue, as indeed it has tackled many other difficult issues. It has tackled issues that the opposition was too frightened to take on when it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this Sydney Airport Curfew Bill, this government has taken an entirely different approach to that adopted by the Leader of the Opposition. Not only does this bill enshrine the curfew in legislation but also it makes it far stronger. The government has already introduced measures to further restrict movements by larger freight aircraft, to phase out movements by noisier aircraft and to tighten dispensations from the curfew. For instance, in the first six months of 1994 there were an average of around 25 dispensations a month. In 1995, there are now only three dispensations a month. With this bill, the government will be increasing the penalties for breaking the curfew to $25,000 for an individual and $100,000 for a corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also requires airlines to justify their use of the curfew. As it finds that the use is not being justified, it will wind back the airline's entitlements. The bill takes a starting point for jet movements in the first and last hours of the curfew not at the current entitlements that exist under the regulations but rather at the current rate of usage. Instead of the permitted 42 movements in these hours per week with no more than eight on any one day, the bill will restrict those movements to 35 per week with a maximum of seven per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes measures that will protect the residents of Sydney against freight operators who might seek to circumvent the curfew by using much bigger, noisier, prop driven aircraft than we have had in the past. The bill will therefore ensure that aircraft over a certain weight, over 34 tonnes, will not be allowed during curfew hours. This means, for example, that we will not have clever freight operators running Hercules aircraft in and out of Sydney throughout the night, which I understand has actually been floated as one way of getting around the curfew and producing a situation of noisier aircraft operating into and out of Mascot. That will be outlawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes a wide range of other measures which add up to genuine improvements in protection from aircraft noise for the people of Sydney. The justification that airlines will be required to give when they seek dispensations from the curfew will be subject to more rigorous examination by the department. There will be wider community input into the guidelines for assessing applications for dispensations from the curfew. On weekends, shoulder curfew operations&mdash;that is, between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. and midnight&mdash;must be over Botany Bay, weather and traffic density permitting. That will take them away from the populous areas of the current flight paths. Also, all departures after 10.45 p.m. must be over Botany Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those measures contained in this bill are a significant improvement on the current long-standing operations of the curfew, which this government has progressively tightened and which will now be enshrined in law. They stand in stark contrast to the proposal originally floated by Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, which was nothing more than a political stunt. If Senator Parer wants to talk about political stunts, that goes down as the daddy of them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to the amendment that has been proposed by the opposition. This amendment effectively seeks to direct the minister to reopen the east-west runway, notwithstanding the best available advice from the experts and the authorities charged with the responsibility on these issues. This has to be one of the most deceitful propositions brought forward by the opposition. It is a proposition based on political expediency, not on sound policy or good advice. As I said, the amendment seeks to direct the minister to reopen the east-west runway without any regard to safety implications, without any prior consideration of advice from the recognised safety agencies and authorities, such as Air Services Australia, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It is a political stunt designed simply to appease the residents of Bennelong, Mr Howard's own electorate, to get him off the hook for supporting the third runway so vociferously in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer gave us a bit of history today. If you look at that history and the constant support given by the opposition, firstly, to the expansion of Mascot airport and the third runway construction, you see how breathtaking the hypocrisy is on their part. This is an opposition that, along with their state government colleagues, at the time led by Mr Greiner, enthusiastically supported the construction of the third runway. There was very little, if any, mention of environmental considerations or possible noise impacts upon the residents of Sydney. It was a case of `get it built; get it built as quickly as you can'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said that we needed to build this third runway at Sydney airport because it would increase capacity and reduce congestion. They also said at the time, and it is on record, that it would drastically reduce the number of residents affected by aircraft noise and that it would be safer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to take just my word for it. Let us first of all take the words of Senator Parer himself. He mentioned that he was on a Senate committee back in 1988. In a dissenting report, Senator Warwick Parer, Senator Chapman and Senator Boswell said a number of things in support of the construction of the third runway. Firstly, at 1.45 they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no-one who disagrees that runway congestion at Sydney airport is the major and immediate problem.</PARA>
<PARA>The major problem is congestion! You do not find too much mention in here by the opposition about problems of aircraft noise. It was the Labor members of parliament that raised those issues in their majority report and called for the construction of a second airport. Further on in the minority report Senator Parer states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important justification for a parallel runway is the dramatic improvement it would provide in bad weather. It would also halve the number of noise affected residents.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are your own words, Senator Parer; that is your prediction. You go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the evidence gathered from representatives of the aviation industry and views expressed by key personnel, we believe a third runway must be commenced without delay and that time be the essence of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, get it built as quickly as possible. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The option which solves the problem in the shortest time span and with least inconvenience to travellers now and in the future is the one which quite clearly must be taken, that is, build the runway.</PARA>
<PARA>The inconvenience to travellers was uppermost in the opposition's mind then, not the inconvenience to Sydney residents who may be affected by aircraft noise. It was not just Senator Parer who was saying that, it was none other than John Howard, the now Leader of the Opposition. He was making those comments as well. What did John Howard say? On 8 February 1989 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interests of safety, airport facilities should be upgraded immediately including the construction of the third runway. The current congestion at the airport is causing increased noise pollution and becoming a serious threat both to travellers and to local residents. The Government is playing carelessly with a situation that could too easily result in a major tragedy. The risk must be averted.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any further delay in deciding on the third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity.</PARA>
<PARA>John Howard and other members of the opposition knew that when the final decision was made to construct the third runway&mdash;quite clearly a decision not popular with many members of the Labor government at the time but nevertheless made&mdash;that decision also involved the downgrading of the east-west runway. It was clear. It was in black and white in the statements made by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Minister for Transport, Ralph Willis. Opposition members knew that was to be the case. They knew that once the third runway was in operation the system of intersecting runways, with or without Simops, would effectively be abandoned in favour of the safer and quicker operation of parallel runways. John Howard acknowledged that in evidence to the Senate committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney. He did that on 25 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When members of the opposition come in here and say that safety was not an issue they are speaking with forked tongues because they are on record as recognising the safety problems associated with the congestion at Sydney airport and the use of the two intersecting runways. Whilst one can argue about semantics&mdash;whether it is safe or unsafe&mdash;there is no doubt that the current operation in Sydney, with parallel runways, is safer than it was before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you drive from Sydney to Canberra, as I do quite regularly, when you are driving on the divided road it is much safer than when you are driving on the undivided road. The risk of collisions at intersections or head-on collisions is reduced. It is the same principle. By removing that intersecting runway operation you make it safer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are members of the opposition trying to do? They are trying to pander, in a rather hypocritical and cynical way, to residents of Sydney who are clearly affected by this problem, who are reaching out for solutions and who, in some cases, are suggesting the reopening of the east-west runway. The opposition's amendment ignores the recognised safety advice from the agencies. Senator Parer has heard their evidence. The opposition is ignoring all of that and is saying, `Let's reopen the east-west runway. Let's direct the minister to do it,' even in situations where it is contrary to independent expert advice. That is why the amendment should be rejected. </PARA>

It probably will not come as a surprise to anyone who heard my reaction to Mr Howard's bill, which he introduced after mine and before this one, which was along extremely similar lines. It should not come as a surprise to anyone that all of us will probably be supporting the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been noted in the debate today, the purpose of this bill is to provide that the curfew on air operations at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport be incorporated into legislation and to prevent any amendments to the legislation unless prior consultation has been entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome these proposed changes, although it is somewhat of a disappointment that the government has taken so long in getting around to introducing these measures at all. These changes are, in fact, a long time overdue. It has been clear for some time now that the new third runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has resulted in quite intolerable levels of noise and general distress to thousands of residents of Sydney whose homes are in noise affected suburbs. The fact that the government has taken this long to respond with this type of legislation does not reflect well on its ability to respond to community concerns. It is no wonder that the suggestion has been made that the motivation behind this legislation has much more to do with the forthcoming federal election and the government's belief that it could well suffer an electoral backlash unless legislation such as this is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill represents a reluctant response on the part of the government finally conceding the necessity for curfew legislation, following on from the massive public outcry over aircraft noise from Sydney's Kingsford Smith. The reality is that, despite the passage of this bill, the public outcry will continue to grow in Sydney because the root causes of the distress and the disruption to ordinary living&mdash;which the new north-south runway and, in particular, the concentrated air paths have caused&mdash;have not gone away and they have not been dealt with adequately. The people living under the approaches know this because they live with intolerable levels of aircraft noise every day of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, these people feel betrayed. People are not stupid and, regrettably, we have to share some of their cynicism. This is against a background where for years now successive Labor and coalition governments at both federal and state level in New South Wales have sought to appease the airline industry at Sydney's Kingsford Smith. In the opposition's case, as we have already heard from Senator Forshaw, this at one time even included consideration of abolishing this curfew altogether. I congratulate them on their present position on this matter. I assume it comes from listening to the hundreds of witnesses and reading the thousands of submissions to the aircraft noise committee, which I also serve on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have a record of consistently drawing attention to the long-term economic, social and environmental effects of continuing to expand Kingsford Smith without due attention being given to the proper environmental impact and the cost-benefit analyses that are essential to go with such processes. The sorry mess that now surrounds air operations at Sydney airport results when proper processes are disregarded or corners are cut in an attempt to achieve some unrealistic electoral commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In previous debates on the airport issue that have taken place in here, Labor and the coalition both blocked our amendments which were designed to have the third runway comply with existing environmental standards. The government's attempts, supported by the coalition, to exempt the third runway from EIS requirements represent a real low point in this whole affair. The people of Sydney know about it. No doubt a great many of them will express their dissatisfaction with both major parties at the next federal election because of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even now the government has still not provided an adequate justification of the reasons it considered necessary to exempt the FAC, the Federal Airports Corporation, from complying with the New South Wales Environmental Protection Act. Every private citizen and corporation in New South Wales is bound by the Environmental Protection Act, but when it comes to building new runways at Sydney such decisions are above the law. If the proper processes had taken place, then some of the current problems at Sydney airport could well have been prevented. Instead, we witnessed a complete disregard for community concerns in the building of the third runway&mdash;concerns which were largely ignored by a government which then proceeded to gloat about the fact that the third runway had been finished ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now glaringly obvious that the EIS was inadequate in a number of key areas. The Senate should be aware of the tragic stories which are now unfolding in the worst noise affected suburbs of Sydney. What about Sydenham, where people are being forced to leave their homes and the neighbourhoods that they have lived in for many years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways what has happened to Sydney is an environmental disaster of major proportions, and it is still going on. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney, I have heard first hand&mdash;as have Senator Parer, Senator Forshaw and several other senators sitting here in the chamber today&mdash;from witnesses appearing before the committee of the absolute destruction and the havoc that has been wreaked on their lives as a result of current air operations. It is not an understatement to suggest that in some cases people believe that their lives have been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, millions of dollars have been spent on attempting to ameliorate the effects of aircraft noise. The costs of the amelioration package now in place are blowing out from initial estimates, especially when you include the cost of purchasing those homes listed for demolition and the costs of soundproofing. In the case of the latter, the costs can only increase over time as more and more people inevitably, with an increase in air traffic, become eligible for soundproofing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those affected residents in Sydney who have been following the KSA aircraft noise debate and the background to this bill have every reason, given the history of this issue, to doubt whether the situation around the airport will ever improve substantially. In fact, if there is one issue which has caused the electorate to become totally cynical about major party politics, this is certainly it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, which is only belated recognition by the government of the problem of air noise in Sydney, does not go far enough in guaranteeing the residents of Sydney an improvement in the overall noise situation. Admittedly, the bill does improve the situation in the so-called shoulder periods surrounding the curfew and also goes some way in tightening the current exemption provisions but, unfortunately, much more could have been achieved by the government with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of the current bill as it stands which the Democrats wholeheartedly welcome is for the first time in this policy area the provision of information to the public. This at least establishes a framework within which public consultation can take place, and I am sure that many people living in Sydney will want to avail themselves of this opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which people seeking really basic information about the airport have been treated is totally unacceptable. In some cases, people appear to have been deliberately misled as to the effects on them of the air operations resulting from the new runway. The Democrats hope that the amendments contained in the bill to provide information and to allow a process of public consultation to take place represent a fresh start in aviation policy making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is however that despite this bill, Sydney airport will continue to be a huge problem for any future government to deal with for many years to come. It is doubtful that measures contained in this bill will make very much difference to residents currently affected by aircraft noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the airport needs of a city the size of Sydney are not being met and nor will they be met even when Badgerys Creek or Sydney West airport becomes operational. The evidence already presented to the Senate select committee gives rise to the worrying conclusion that the airport capacity problems in Sydney will continue to be around for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the evidence suggests that there are many disadvantages in having dual airports in one city. The major airlines are already resisting any suggestion that they move their operations from Kingsford-Smith to the Sydney West site, and the people in the vicinity of Badgerys Creek are already concerned about what the airport will mean for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways the mistakes which successive governments have made in relation to Kingsford Smith are being made now in relation to Badgerys Creek. There is no guarantee that the people of Sydney West will not suffer in the future in the same way which the people affected by operations at Kingsford Smith are currently suffering. Indeed, if the experience of people affected by the third runway is anything to go by, there is a danger that the needs of people in Sydney's west will be overlooked when planning and building of Sydney West takes shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the Democrats believe that the answer may lie in finding a site for a new airport completely outside any future Sydney residential areas if we are to break this vicious cycle of disastrous airport planning that appears likely to be repeated at Badgerys Creek. Surely it is about time that this federal government, indeed all federal and New South Wales governments, did some serious and comprehensive planning for the future airport needs of Sydney and then acted immediately on the results of that planning. This is the time for sensible and rational planning to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current situation has gone on far too long. People living under or even near the concentrated flight paths feel betrayed and abandoned. That sounds melodramatic but it is true. Those are the words they use and they are absolutely in ernest when they use them. The curfew was put in place when the noise was identified as a problem in 1963&mdash;a long time ago. The problem has only got worse since then. This bill will help but it is by no means a solution to the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Being a senator from New South Wales, I am keenly interested in Sydney Airport. One has to say that, as a political issue, very few things have created so much heat and perhaps so little light in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is a problem that faces not only New South Wales and Sydney; it faces airports around the world. It does not matter whether you go to Hong Kong where a new airport is being planned there or to New York where some of the manifest problems that have occurred there can be seen. It is the same pattern. Airports are built at times when they are convenient to cities. But as time goes on, the population growth in those cities means that those airports are no longer conveniently located. They have become a constant source of stress and difficulty for residents living in their vicinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kingsford Smith airport is no different. It is nobody's fault that this has happened. It is an inevitable part of what happens whenever there is population growth that outstrips the available infrastructure. But one thing is certainly true: this really only became an issue, as far as the senators opposite are concerned, once it started to impact upon their party's electoral fortunes and, in particular, those of their leader. Once the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) found that he had an electoral margin of 3.2 per cent in Bennelong and that planes were predominantly flying over that electorate, it suddenly became an issue for those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to emphasise that on this side of the chamber because all sorts of red herrings are being drawn in about capacity, the number of planes that can land, safety issues, and so on. But let us not forget that this is the major reason why this became prominent; this is the major reason why the Leader of the Opposition decided to make such an issue of it and, indeed, change his plan. However, what is remarkable about the coalition's response on this issue is how they went about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a problem which has been a vexatious one for air safety authorities around the world. But the opposition were able to come up with a completely new method of looking at it, a completely new ingredient in all of this debate. They pulled out the electoral map. When everybody else was looking at issues of safety and issues of efficiency, they pulled out the electoral map. And what did they find? They found on the electoral map that Bennelong was threatened and that Lowe was a seat in which they thought they had some fortune. So they decided that they had better put the planes somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did they do? They had a look at either side of the airport and saw that, on the east-west runway, the planes only went over Labor electorates. How convenient! I do not know whether that would be very helpful in Hong Kong or New York, but it was certainly very helpful to members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition simply referred to the electoral map. But, of course, in doing so, they brought into question the whole issue of safety, the whole issue of efficiency and the role of proper government policy. They wanted to reopen the east-west runway&mdash;that was the answer&mdash;to spread the planes more evenly over Labor electorates and try to give themselves a hope that Senator Woods might be able to vindicate himself, having lost the seat of Lowe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that cynicism, the experts in this regard were virtually unanimous in condemning the east-west runway as a means of solving this particular problem. I will go through the list&mdash;and it has been gone through before, but I am happy to go through it again&mdash;and look at all those who were concerned. Both airlines, Qantas and Ansett, on 18 September endorsed the operational efficiency of parallel runways. In a joint statement they said that the safety considerations really prohibited any prospect of the east-west runway being reopened on a full-time basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that the government has never proposed to entirely close the east-west runway; it is only a matter of using it in simultaneous operations. There are times when the east-west runway has to be used because of the way in which the prevailing winds are blowing and what is the best result for a safety outcome. Nevertheless, here you have both airlines coming out in support of the parallel runway as the only way to go. You also have that of every other safety authority in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airservices Australia, on 14 August, said exactly the same thing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . international acceptance that parallel runway operations are inherently safer than any arrangement involving intersecting runways . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and on they went. If you have a look at what the Civil Aviation Safety Authority says, they make exactly the same point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is of the view that the restoration of SIMOPS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, simultaneous operations on intersecting runways&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">procedures at Sydney Airport, while parallel runways are available, would be less safe than the current parallel runway system in operation.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia said exactly the same thing&mdash;and they said it directly to Senator Parer. When he asked them the question, `Are you suggesting that cross-runway operations are not safe or just less safe?' the reply was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are less safe. They rely more heavily upon the skill of the aerodrome controller in judging the point of conflict . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and on they went. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, any reasonable person can see as a matter of absolute logic that intersecting runways are inherently a safety risk in any airport operation. Faced with this sort of embarrassing support for the government and attacks on the basis of the opposition's policy, the Leader of the Opposition immediately clutches at whatever fig leaf of support he can possibly get. He has found this recently in the Flight Transport Associates report, which he has made so much of. He now declares that this means that his option of re-opening the east-west runway is safe. Let us look at what that report was based on. The report was prepared in 1989. It was a theoretical computer model exercise of capacity options at the airport. It did not represent a detailed analysis of operational safety issues. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of the airport under existing conditions and under a number of hypothetical&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress `hypothetical'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">future alternatives has to be estimated. It should be emphasised that the examination of a hypothetical alternative does not imply that this scenario has been deemed feasible with respect to engineering, economic, environmental, statutory and other aspects.</PARA>
<PARA>So even there you can find that there is no real support for the proposition that the other side are putting up. So where do we go with this? What is the real result if you are going to bring back the east-west runway to full operation? The first thing you will have to do is reduce capacity. It is impossible to land the same number of planes at the airport as is currently available under two parallel runways. If you are going to reduce capacity, who will be the first to suffer? It will be the residents of regional New South Wales. The only way you would possibly be able to do it would be to consolidate the flights going into Kingsford Smith on a hub and spoke basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some sort of indication of the ramifications which would be the inevitable consequence of opening up the east-west runway. If you, for instance, were in Dubbo and you wanted to fly direct to Sydney it would take you about 55 minutes and the current cost would be about $338. However, if you had to hub through Orange to consolidate the number of passengers going in, the flight time would go up to an hour and 55 minutes and the total cost would be $436. Another example would be Albury. If you fly direct from Albury to Sydney it currently takes about an hour and 10 minutes and costs $432. If you were hubbed through Canberra to consolidate the number of passengers into bigger planes you would be looking at two hours and 15 minutes and a cost of $528. I could give other examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if people in regional Australia imagine that there is absolutely any benefit for them in the current proposal by the opposition, let them think seriously about the fact that it is going to take them longer to get to Sydney and is going to cost them more at the current prevailing rates of airfares in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a personal interest in all of this because I lived under the flight path. When I was growing up I went to school in Kingsgrove. I came home and did my homework to the sound of jets roaring over my head. Prior to my marriage I lived in Kogarah. I had exactly the same experience that millions of other people in Sydney have&mdash;certainly hundreds of thousands. You come home at the end of the day and you want to relax in front of the television. You do that to the sound of aircraft roaring overhead. It is entirely unpleasant. Those people have every good reason to complain, every good reason to find this a severe curtailment of the enjoyment of their lives, particularly their leisure hours. This government is entirely sympathetic to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental question that has to be asked every time you look at an alternative is: are you compromising fundamental aspects of safety? That is where re-opening the east-west runway founders&mdash;on the safety question. If I were doing my homework back in Kingsgrove in the 1960s there are quite a few things I would have hoped the then government would have done to alleviate the situation. These are the sorts of things which are incorporated in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Forshaw mentioned these things in great detail earlier but I might mention them again in summary because they bear restating: a reduction in current quotas for international passenger movements during the curfew shoulders and the setting up of procedures that will allow a progressive reduction in the number of these movements; on weekends, new arrangements that will minimise aircraft overflying suburbs between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. and between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.; the bringing forward to 10.45 p.m. of the time at which the last flights at night can take off over these suburbs; amendments to stop operators getting around the curfew by using large, propeller-driven aircraft; and increases in the penalties for curfew breaches from the maximum of $25,000 to $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of changes that are going to make a difference to people. There is absolutely no question that these are the sorts of measures that will alleviate the sort of misery that is inevitable whenever you live near an airport. These are in addition to the other measures which the government has brought forward over the last year or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also has to be remembered that it is Badgerys Creek which at the end of the day is the only real alternative to Kingsford Smith. That is the only thing that will really address the question of aircraft noise. Over $1 billion has been committed to a transport package for Sydney west airport. Only recently, in the last year or so, the government has already committed itself to $480 million to improve the road links to that airport. Fast tracking Badgerys Creek, which the government is entirely committed to, is the only answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do we have? Where does this proposal, this amendment, to reopen the east-west runway on a full-time basis stand? It stands in exactly the same way as just about everything the coalition has done this year and in the last term. Ever since John Howard became leader those opposite have taken the low road. This is the party which believes in opportunism, cynicism and calumny. Those opposite think that is clever. They think deceit is smart. They think that by going the low road, by doing the cynical thing, by doing the opportunistic thing, somehow that is going to improve their electoral fortunes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a pattern to it. Eventually people will see there is a pattern to it. We have already heard from Senator Forshaw how Mr Howard has done a 180 degree turnaround on his view on the third runway. But it is exactly the same thinking that has left everybody in Australia in no doubt that the Easton royal commission was a cynical attempt to get Carmen Lawrence and nothing else. It is the same pattern of thinking which has meant that there is absolutely no policy detail coming from the opposition because it is absolutely afraid of anybody looking at its plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget John Hewson has warned those opposite that people will not stand this any longer. John Hewson has told them that they have to have policy detail, that they have to be honest with people, that they cannot go for cynical alternatives. Nick Greiner has told them exactly the same thing. But I think it is salutary that on this issue, about which they are prepared to be cynical, about which they are prepared to trade-off whatever they can for a few votes in Bennelong and in the hope that they might take Lowe, the lie will finally be nailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> headline on September 28 this year finally says it: `Howard's crash-landing'. The article states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I look at those issues and touch upon some of the somewhat obscure and irrelevant arguments raised by senators opposite, I want to target the real reason why we are debating this legislation today. It has nothing to do with operational needs or resources; it is a political exercise in cynicism. It is run by none other than our Artful Dodger Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who is an anonymous puppet master, pulling the strings behind the scenes, who seems to want to hide from public view when the moves fall apart, as they have done in terms of Sydney airport. </PARA>

The then Treasurer, the man who frequently told the media how he had to push his Labor colleagues into adopting those policy decisions, stampeded his cabinet colleagues in 1989&mdash;and we have heard from Senator Forshaw exactly how that happened&mdash;into approving the third runway and reversing plans to direct most take-offs and landings over water. That plan had initially been intended to substantially reduce the problem of airport noise for many thousands of people in suburbs all around the airport and its approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the Prime Minister decide to head in this direction? The usual reason he does everything is to look after his special coterie of Labor mates, such as: the Minister for Transport; his sister, Deidre Grusovin; and&mdash;isn't it ironic in 1995?&mdash;Bob Carr. Each of these mates hold seats, state or federal, which had been affected by noise from the east-west runway and, what a surprise, suffered no adverse reaction from their constituents when that noise was suddenly removed to other areas north and south of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's calculated plans enabled him effectively to punish residents on the lower north shore for shunning ALP candidates&mdash;showing that impeccable judgment which we rely on from those people&mdash;by channelling all of the airport noise in their direction. He puts the political interest of a few of his personal allies ahead of tens of thousands of Sydneysiders who now suffer absolutely intolerable levels of noise hour by hour, day by day. The petty interests of those grateful mates obviously took precedence over the needs of the people of Sydney&mdash;and that is an indication of the misplaced priorities that we face from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister cannot claim innocence in this matter. His personal involvement in the relevant cabinet decisions was put on the public record last year by Laurie Oakes, I believe, in his column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. It is indeed poetic that Laurie Brereton, the Minister for Transport&mdash;one of the major beneficiaries of the senseless and irresponsible policy reversal&mdash;is now saddled with the massive task of appeasing the many people hurt by that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard over and over again, and again here today, that one of the tactics for trying to justify the closure of the east-west runway is a constant refrain of `safety concerns'. He says it is impossible to operate safely the east-west runway in conjunction with the north-south parallel runways. This is drivel. Numbers of leading airports around the world happily operate intersecting runways without any problem whatsoever. There is, of course, a theoretical risk of collisions with crossovers. But it clearly can be very easily managed if effective operational measures are put in place and has been managed for something like 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the EIS for the third runway project never even considered the issue of cross-runway safety, which is a good guide to the government's concerns about safety at that time. I might point out that neither Qantas nor Ansett referred to the matter in their written submissions to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney of which I am a member. Again, a reliable guide that the government's recent claims are based on political, and not genuine, safety concerns. Expert witness after expert witness before the Senate inquiry, including: the Australian International Pilots Association; the regional airlines; the air traffic controllers union, the Civil Air Operations Officers Association; and numerous pilots, who must know what they are talking about, say there are no grounds for concern if the east-west runway is reopened. </PARA>

The madness is the closure of the east-west runway. Let me quote a few things that Jim Thorn, a highly regarded expert on this issue, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a technical basis there is absolutely no reason why all three runways cannot be fully utilised to their original design limits at KSA. It is not unsafe to use intersecting runways as Brereton and Co keep telling us. Sure, parallel runways are slightly safer but the real world difference is so small that it is hardly worth mentioning. After all, KSA operated for more than half a century with crossing runways without any real dramas just as Tullamarine does today, tomorrow and probably forever. Does Laurie really think we are that stupid?</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even parallel runways have their problems. Since the third runway opened there have been several incidence of aircraft taking off with one vectoring the wrong way, and towards the aircraft abeam of it. This happened recently when an Air France 747 turned left instead of right, as directed by ATC, into the path of a domestic jet.</PARA>
<PARA>Parallel runways do have their own problems. These have been highlighted by Jim Thorn. </PARA>

<PARA>Of course, what we have now is not a three-runway airport but a two-runway airport; we have just changed the direction of the second runway. Indeed, as Senator Parer pointed out earlier, we do not even have two runways. We have one and probably seven-eighths of a runway. The last paragraph of this editorial from Jim Thorn says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional airlines have also pointed out that crossing the sky with a separation of 1,000 feet is very dangerous in itself. So there is an element of risk. But there is an element of risk in flying, full stop. If you want to have a completely safe airline system, you would basically never take off. We are talking about minor differences in safety. It is clear by any criteria that cross runways can be used in a safe manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly for the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport, the truth about the safe operation of intersecting runways was revealed by the transport minister of 1991, Senator Bob Collins, when he told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facts are that simultaneous operations are in operation at many major airports around the world. There is absolutely no reason why simultaneous operations, if conducted efficiently and professionally, cannot be used&mdash;as they are in Adelaide as well as Sydney&mdash;with perfect safety.</PARA>
<PARA>We do not often trust Senator Collins's judgment on all things, but in this regard he is spot on. It would be remarkable if the situation had changed as dramatically since 1991 as the Minister for Transport would now have the people of Sydney believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more plausible explanation is that the minister is trying to protect the unearned bonus he received from the PM&mdash;the removal of the aircraft noise problem from his electorate, indeed for his own residents. The member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) must be feeling a bit isolated and a bit vulnerable by these events because parts of her seat are now subject to extra noise directly because of the Prime Minister's arrangements in the Labor government. That is the price you pay&mdash;even in the ALP&mdash;if you are not one of the very special mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe it was the pressure of needing to come up with something&mdash;anything&mdash;to toss to her constituents which led to the Member for Lowe's amazing $5 billion plan to demolish the Kurnell Oil Refinery, to demolish 1,000 local homes and to get rid of Kurnell as a community, to build a new east-west runway on that site&mdash;which is on the other side of Botany Bay from where the existing airport is&mdash;and to presumably have ferries and what have you to take people back to the main airport. She seemed to be serious. She included this lunacy in a formal submission to the select committee and later had the gall to tell the media that she had consulted numerous experts on the concept. We could not find them at the time, of course. But, happily, nothing has been heard of it since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what nonsense the member for Lowe proposed to the inquiry, the sad truth is that she voted with the government in blocking John Howard's proposed amendment to this bill. She is on the record as having supported more aircraft noise over the residents of Lowe. That amendment would have resulted in a reopening of the east-west runway and thereby spared the people of Lowe from much of the intolerable noise burden they currently endure. I am sure the constituents of Lowe will not be amused to learn how Mrs Easson, the member for Lowe, voted. I can assure her that we will not be keeping that betrayal a secret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Labor government has said to the people of Lowe is that they are dispensable in terms of this issue. They expected something like 12 per cent of take-offs to go to the north over Lowe. It has now turned out to be 38 per cent&mdash;initially, supposedly, because of the high incidence of unusual wind patterns in the summer of 1994-95. Those wind patterns seem to be going on for a long time. The fact is that the environmental impact statement was flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important question we need to ask now is: why is this bill here now? Why is it that for 12 years the Labor government has ignored the needs of thousands of people and has suddenly become concerned about their welfare? Could it be that the legislation is a belated attempt by the government to claim the credit for John Howard's moves to enshrine in a private member's bill the need for a curfew? Who is pushing it forward? Chief mate, the Minister for Transport, running behind the play as usual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a special case. Normally we would be forgiven for immediately rejecting any legislative proposal, but he has proposed something worth while, something which has basically been stolen from John Howard, in the interests of the people of Sydney. Of course, he had to tamper with the package a bit to make it look as though it were not stolen straight off John Howard's desk, but the overall concept is John Howard's&mdash;proper protection of the interests of people affected by breaches of the existing curfew. It is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we heard previously from Senator Forshaw, in the first six months of 1994 there were 25 breaches a month. That is how useless the curfew was. It is only exposure of the issue by John Howard which has raised an awareness which has led to a fall in that number of breaches. The fact is that more and more airlines were flouting the system. The government's response was to endorse more and more breaches of the rules. It has taken the opposition to force the government into taking this much belated action to enshrine the curfew into legislation, and we are happy to take the credit for that. Hopefully, this is just the first step towards fixing the overall airport noise problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Wheelwright said that this was nobody's fault. That was his introductory line, if I remember rightly. Let me point out that he is absolutely wrong. This is the Labor Party's fault.

It is the Labor Party which has to take the blame for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Senator Wheelwright is condemned out of his own mouth. He said that we, the Liberal Party, had taken out the electoral map when we decided to reopen the east-west runway and that we would again spread the noise over Labor electorates. Excuse me, but doesn't that mean that, when you closed the east-west runway, you took the noise away from Labor electorates? Haven't you just confessed to the motivation behind closing the east-west runway&mdash;that this is a purely political issue; that there are no safety concerns here at all? There is no question at all about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, Senator Forshaw was right. He said this is a watershed, the first time in law that this has happened.

Contrary to his rather obscure and vague theory about hub and spoke airlines and his trying to imply that to fly from Dubbo to Sydney would take longer and cost more&mdash;what that has to do with the curfew, I am not quite sure&mdash;the reopening of the east-west runway is something that the regional airlines and all the regional bodies will quite happily support us raising in the context of this curfew bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill. It is important, when considering the bill, to look at the recent history of the matter and in particular the coalition's position in relation to the operation of the airport. The airport operated adequately and met demands without a large amount of conflict with the surrounding area up until the 1960s. In the 1970s, the concept of the construction of a third runway was hatched. It was given considerable momentum by the Major Airport Needs of Sydney Committee&mdash;otherwise known as the MANS committee&mdash;which resulted in a joint study which was conducted by the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments in 1977. This process went a bit astray and as a result a final report was never tabled, but a dissenting Commonwealth report was produced and tabled by members of the Fraser government in 1979. The report said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The construction of a close-space parallel runway and associated facilities east of the existing north-south runway is required.</PARA>
<PARA>In October 1982, the coalition Minister for Aviation, Wal Fife, announced the construction of the new runway. Unfortunately for the minister, in the following March he and all his fellow ministers were removed from their portfolios, having lost the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988, a joint Commonwealth-New South Wales task force on the airport needs of the Sydney basin found that a need existed for a third runway at Sydney airport and also a second airport at Badgerys Creek. The task force found that both these were required to accommodate Sydney's growing air traffic. In 1988, the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure also considered the future construction of the third runway. Senator Warwick Parer, the current chair of the airport noise inquiry, said that the construction of a third runway should have started immediately. He issued a minority report to support his view and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only decision which can be made is for an immediate start on a parallel runway.</PARA>
<PARA>In the following year, 1989, the government decided to construct a third runway together with the commencement of the second airport at Badgerys Creek. This decision received considerable support from the then Premier, Nick Greiner, who has since been swept from his position. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New South Wales government believes there should be a third runway and there should be an additional airport at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1991, Mr Greiner went on to say, in reference to the third runway, that it was the single most important project in Australia. The now Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, in 1989, when commenting on the third runway, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the case for it on general interest grounds is overwhelming. Our policy is to build it. That's been our policy for the past 6 1/2 years.</PARA>
<PARA>On 4 November 1994, the runway was completed six months ahead of schedule and $30 million under budget. For a considerable number of years the curfew has existed at Sydney airport preventing take-offs and landings between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. each night. This is aimed at reducing the noise effects on the surrounding residents during the time that they are generally resting. It was a result of the awareness and sensitivity of the government to the adverse effect that airport noise can have on the surrounding community and an attempt to limit the effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the late 1980s, Kingsford-Smith was having difficulty meeting the demands placed on it, particularly as it was still limited by the use of intercepting runways. In 1988, shoulder periods were introduced to the curfew. The shoulder periods allowed for a limited amount of international aircraft movements between the hours of 11 p.m. and midnight and 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was to meet the overwhelming demand on the use of the airport by both international flights and domestic and country movements. About 17 million passengers were passing through Kingsford-Smith airport each year and the airport just could not cope. In fact, the log jams were getting so bad that, according to the industry at the time, delays and flight cancellations were costing an estimated $40 million. The shoulder periods were trying to cope with this problem by slightly increasing the capacity of the airport. It is these shoulder periods that this bill largely deals with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill sets in place safeguards necessary to ensure that the curfew periods and the shoulder periods of an hour on each side are not abused by the airlines which have flights coming in at the time. The purpose of the bill is to control, as far as possible, aircraft operations during that period. It does so in several ways. International take-offs and landings&mdash;generally the loudest&mdash;between 5.00 a.m. and 6.00 a.m. have been reduced from the 42 per week presently operating to 35. International take-offs and landings between 11.00 p.m. and midnight will be held at their present level of 14 per week and no increase will be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with the Morris committee's proposed phase-out of curfew flights, the bill allows the following lower operations to be introduced. Operations of British Aerospace flight services will be set at 65 per week until the week ending 5 May 1996. After this date, operations increase to 74 per week but will be offset by a decrease in the operations of DC9 aircraft. Certain propeller driven aircraft and jet aircraft under 34,000 kilograms will be permitted to operate during curfew hours provided that they meet strict international noise standards. In fact, the level of noise that they will be producing will be equivalent to that of a family car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reverse thrust restrictions will be placed on the operators of aircraft, requiring them not to plan to land at Sydney airport during the curfew period if greater than idle thrust will be required. Between 10.45 p.m. and 11.00 p.m. aircraft taking off from Sydney airport must operate over Botany Bay and thus will not be flying over any homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures will go a long way towards reducing noise during the curfew operations at Sydney airport, even in the shoulder period. The bill also provides a platform wherein operations can be reduced in the future. Such freight service movements as are allowed can be phased out under this legislation. The bill further provides for accountability for operators during the curfew period to both the parliament and the public at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with the amendments proposed by Senator Parer on behalf of the coalition and Senator Bourne on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The amendment proposed by the opposition calls on the minister to increase the use of the east-west runway. I want to emphasise a couple of things in relation to that. The east-west runway is not completely closed, as I am sure most of the people in the chamber appreciate. I realise that many members of the general public would not appreciate this fact. The runway is still used when conditions make it unsafe to use the parallel runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to some comments made by Mr Howard when he moved a like amendment in the other place. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is all about the fair sharing of a burden. One of the great Australian traditions is that Australians will always support the fair sharing of a burden.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition believes that this applies to the devastating and extraordinary burden that this amendment will place on the rural people of Australia. Airservices Australia is responsible for the management of air movements and has indicated that the normal use of the east-west runway for full jet operations will reduce airport capacity by 35 per cent. This would require a reduction in aircraft operations at Sydney airport. It will have much the same effect as the amendment proposed by Senator Bourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will be the effect of this serious decrease in the capacity of the airport? There will be a disproportionate effect on country services. The smaller airlines, the smaller planes and the less profitable routes will be squeezed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, a number of country commuter services will be forced to be reduced. Larger planes will be leaving fewer centres less often and will cost more and take longer. If I were a member of the National Party I would be very concerned about this matter. Services from small centres that now fly conveniently and more cheaply directly to Sydney will have to fly to larger regional centres, change planes and then fly on to Sydney, or possibly even on to some bigger centre and then again change planes and go on to Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process which I said had been misunderstood in the earlier Senate debate is known as hubbing. This hubbing will provide rural and regional commuters with an inadequate and expensive service. For example, at the moment to travel directly from Port Macquarie to Sydney takes 55 minutes and costs $348; hubbing through Newcastle on, say, Eastern Airlines for the same trip would take one hour and 50 minutes and would cost $470. At the moment to travel directly from Albury to Sydney takes 70 minutes and costs $432; hubbing through Canberra on Kendall Airlines would take two hours and 15 minutes and would cost $528. The opposition's complete reopening of the east-west runway would place a tremendous burden on the country people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major problem with the increased usage of the east-west runway, which has been referred to by previous speakers in the government, is the safety risk it poses to air passengers and surrounding residents of the airport who may be affected by fallout from a collision. BASI, which was charged with the auditing of air safety, said at a hearing of the aircraft noise committee held last week that `parallel runways are inherently safer than intersecting runways'. It is blatantly obvious to Australians that operations which have planes taking off and landing crossing the paths of other planes taking off and landing are less safe than operations involving planes that take off and land parallel to one another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some argument that planes operating on parallel runways cross paths when in the air. This may be true in a purely token sense but, as was pointed out by Airservices, there is virtually a 1,000-metre division between those planes. There is a general argument that crossing runways are less safe. Even Senator Parer's coalition partners know it. The Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, said on 13 August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any further delay in deciding on the third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity with Mascot now operating at near maximum capacity and air traffic controllers bending over backwards to extract maximum efficiency of the present archaic runway set up.</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the crossing runway, of which I am sure everyone is aware. The risk is further highlighted by giving consideration to the number of times crossings would occur if the east-west runway was further utilised. In a recent brief to the minister, Rob Brattner from the Civil Aviation Authority said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large number of aircraft would need to cross the east-west runway to position for take-off on the parallel runway or in taxiing to the terminals after landing. It is estimated that aircraft would be expected to cross the east-west runway every 45 seconds or less.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the intersecting east-west runway, the required safety corridors to accommodate aircraft carrying out miss approaches could not readily be accommodated.</PARA>
<PARA>Any way you strike it in terms of throughput or in terms of safety, the parallel runway is the way to go. In 1981 an accident almost occurred on the intersecting runways. We have to be grateful that it did not. If it was not for the quick thinking of the pilot of an Ansett jet, who pulled up before colliding with a Thai airline plane, there would have been potentially 1,000 deaths arising from that accident. That is not a risk I am prepared to take, and I do not think the majority of the Australian community is prepared to take it either. I urge the Senate to reject the amendments of both Senator Parer and Senator Bourne. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Bob Collins, who is in the chamber, just interjected. Of course, Senator Bob Collins is on the record of 13 August 1991 as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facts are that simultaneous operations are in operation at many, many major airports around the world. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why simultaneous operations, if conducted efficiently and professionally, cannot be used&mdash;as they are used in Adelaide, as well as Sydney&mdash;with perfect safety.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the minister that simultaneous operations operate in a lot of international airports, including O'Hare in Chicago, Los Angeles International, La Guardia in New York and Logan International in Boston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, a number of other leading experts have said that it is perfectly safe. For instance, the Australian International Pilots Association said in its submission to the Senate select committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provided that a model for the correct use of the airspace concerned was satisfactorily tested to levels accepted by air traffic controllers, pilots, the airlines, the CAA and the community, that would permit simultaneous use of all 3 runways, then such operations should be permitted and encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Flight Transportation Associates, a leading US consultancy, said in November 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we can say that internationally accepted standards exist for the simultaneous operation of crossing/intersecting runways and, as such, these standards should allow for the safe and efficient operation of Kingsford Smith International Airport as has been the case in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of other people support this view. I want to put on record a comment by the CEO designate of Airservices Australia on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program on 29 September 1995. He made these comments before he was nobbled by the government. Mr Pollard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . throughout the world and in my past experience, there are many airports that have intersecting runways and they're used quite safely. In fact, many airports do not have parallel runways, but usually have one north-south and one east-west and many times they are intersecting, and it's done safely.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989, when the third runway at Kingsford Smith airport was being talked about, it had two runways&mdash;one north-south, and one east-west. The Labor government spent $250 million of taxpayers' money, and we have ended up with 1 1/2 runways. You cannot take off to the north on the new, second parallel runway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were promised three runways and we finished up with 1 1/2 runways. It seems to be a bit of Labor inflation in reverse. We have not increased the capacity of Sydney airport. In the process we have spent $250 million of taxpayers' money, with much more to be spent on noise amelioration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's incompetence over the whole affair is made clear by its haste to open the third runway. It was opened before the close ground separation radar was working. It was opened before the new control tower was opened. The new control tower is not open yet. At the end of the day, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) engineered the crisis that we are facing today. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of December last year Laurie Oakes wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original proposal was supposed to be that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than houses. Clever Keating changed that and sent them roaring over suburbia. The east-west runway was supposed to continue operating, but it was Keating that killed that idea, too, and ensured that all planes operated on the north-south axis.</PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity to say something about the noise assessment process, of which there has been much criticism. The noise impact assessment in the EIS was done by using the Australian standard known as the Australian noise enforcement forecast. It is commonly called the ANEF. Airservices Australia, formerly the CAA, says that the forecast on noise contours is accurate. However, many more people feel affected than was expected. It seems to me that is a flawed method of assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the ANEF is designed as a land use planning tool. Up to 20 ANEF is regarded as standard urban noise. Many people who are subject to 20 ANEF feel that it is much more than standard urban noise. Many Sydney residents felt that as they were outside the 20 ANEF contour they would be all right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original EIS said that there would be only 82,000 residents inside the 15 ANEF. In other words, it was calculated that with the virtual closure of the east-west runway the number affected would be reduced from 130,000 to 82,000. However, 300,000 people believe they are affected, many seriously, and were, therefore, misinformed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the difficulty of estimating the impact of noise. Even at an ANEF of 10, 20 per cent of residents would be affected, and 25 per cent of those would feel seriously affected. It is the constancy of noise along the flight paths, not just the lack of veracity in the assessment process, that has caused the outcry. As I said, 5,000 submissions cannot all be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airservices Australia, which is now responsible for monitoring noise, never said there would be no noise, but people in the 20 ANEF contour are getting readings of up to 90 decibels. It must be remembered that about 65 decibels interferes with normal conversation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just bring to your notice, Mr Acting Deputy President, that only those houses in the 30-plus ANEF contour are being soundproofed; the 40-plus are being purchased by the government. Schools in the 25-plus are being soundproofed, but the 4,200 houses that are being soundproofed will cost the travelling public about $260 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some lessons and solutions from this shambles. We must, as a community, find better ways of consulting within the community on these sorts of major decisions. For the development of Sydney south-west airport we must develop additional information on noise or history will be repeated. I acknowledge that when Sydney south-west airport is open we will have quieter aircraft, but the problem of noise is not going to go away, especially with people who quite legitimately expect to have a cleaner and better environment in which to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, there is an enormous difference in this whole disappointing episode between what people were told and how many feel that they are affected by noise. Overall, there is this requirement that the east-west runway be reopened to spread the noise burden, and I support Senator Parer's amendment in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the noise curfew bill with the amendment to reopen the east-west runway. We believe that Airservices Australia should be given the ability to reopen the third runway for normal operations, bearing in mind safety, capacity and noise. I think that if those three requirements of safety, capacity and noise are met, there is no reason&mdash;this is supported by the experts that I called on earlier&mdash;why the east-west runway should not be reopened. Airservices Australia in their evidence to us agree that they operate to government instruction&mdash;and one would not expect them to do anything else, as that is obviously the role that they have&mdash;but I believe that the government policy should be changed without prejudicing safety, and it should be done to share the noise load. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to finish by pointing out the obvious&mdash;the importance of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in its unique position for a major airport in a major city and as a gateway to Australia; what an important part aviation has played in the development of this very vast continent; and what an important part KSA has played in that. I think that that should remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make the point that it is absolutely vital for regional airlines and country people doing business in Sydney to have access to KSA because, if they were forced to go anywhere else&mdash;to Sydney south-west, for instance&mdash;the cost of coming down for a day's business would be made much greater by the necessity probably to stay overnight. That is something that regional New South Wales does not need&mdash;now or at any stage. I just make the point that the question is: why can't aircraft operate east of the airport during the middle of the day when there are very few traffic movements? Regional airlines use propjet aircraft, which are much quieter anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it needs to be said that there are obvious advantages of KSA. When we were talking about the Olympic bid, it was pointed out that Kingsford Smith was a very convenient airport for overseas visitors, and it is. The final thing I would like to say is that, if Australia is to be a hub in Asia, we need an airport that can grow in addition to our new Sydney south-west airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Greens (WA), I would like to place on the record some concerns and some ideas on the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill. We agree with the bill in terms of being able to vote for it; in fact, it puts current regulation in a regulatory framework. However, the timing of it is perhaps either unfortunate or opportune. The timing is unfortunate because there is still a committee dealing with the noise issues at Sydney airport and some of the amendments that we are being asked to consider on this bill are outcomes or responses to the committee's deliberations. It would be extremely useful for us to have those deliberations as a basis for making decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there will be no huge changes as a result of the bill, because it largely establishes a regulatory framework anyway&mdash;it simply confirms the status quo&mdash;would not necessarily make much difference to the way things are now operating at Sydney. Perhaps we could call this the Sydney Airport Election Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing now, long after the fact, is the result of a knee-jerk reaction to demand projection, and that tends to be focused on dollars. Perhaps when the original plans were being made the actual social, environmental and other considerations were not put high enough on the agenda to be carefully considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of the process in Perth when city feeder roads got jammed at peak times. The response from a series of governments has been to widen the roads to enable those roads to take more traffic and faster. Another response has been to provide more parking space. The only response, of course, to that has been to increase road traffic and to end up with another traffic jam. Perth has the highest per capita parking space of any major city in Australia. So in that sense, people increased demand instead of thinking more laterally about alternatives to road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have seen a similar situation with air transport: an increased demand in the use of Sydney airport caused partly by airline decisions to duplicate schedules and by a lack of viable, attractive alternatives. Some of those alternatives could be a properly planned, very fast train from Sydney to major points where Sydney traffic is in demand, and a much greater concentration and availability of video conferencing for all those kinds of one-day trips from Sydney to Canberra or from Sydney to Melbourne. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a recently published paper from Murdoch University by Mr Brian Fleays which talked about the world's demand for and supply of petroleum. There is a growing consensus that in a relatively short time, the world will be reaching the halfway point of the world's petroleum resources. You might think, `Oh, this is great. We have been using petroleum for years and years.' Yes, but we are using it at a much greater rate now than we were doing 10 or 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that industry, of course, have used the cheapest and most easily available sources of petroleum quickest. From the halfway point, any economist will tell you that the marginal cost of producing that petroleum will go through the roof.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would concur with the reference made by Senator Margetts to the technology available nowadays that can assist in reducing unnecessary travel. It is technology that I personally use at every opportunity. I might just say to Senator Margetts that I have found from my own experience that telephone conferencing, when dealing with people who in the main you know, is as effective a tool as video conferencing. With the high fidelity equipment that is available now for telephone conferencing, I have found that the vision, being able to see the person concerned, does not add anything to it&mdash;and in the case of someone like myself, in fact, positively improves the aesthetics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technology such as this and fast rail should be used at every opportunity. I can also relate to what Senator Margetts said about taking into consideration the full extent of the journey. It is certainly something I do, Senator Margetts. That is the reason why when I go to Newcastle from Sydney I routinely travel by train. Why waste time going to the airport to sit around at the terminal, get onto the taxiway and finally get to wherever you are going when you have the option of an extremely pleasant short train journey&mdash;and it is still one of the more pleasant train journeys in Australia? It is line ball and people should do that. I wish to concur with those suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts would agree that is something that will, I hope, happen to an increasing extent in the future to attempt to ameliorate, to some extent, the frequency of flights. But flying, without a doubt, is an extremely safe form of travel. It is the most effective and efficient form of travel in a country as large as ours. It is being used, as we know, with increasing frequency. That is likely to be the reality, despite those technological advancements, for some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the general theme of the opposition's contribution to the debate, it traversed over a very well-worn path. I guess the thing that irritates me just a tad is the extraordinary case of collective amnesia which the opposition is suffering from. Senator Bourne, I might add, had the awfully bad taste to point that out to those opposite in her contribution. But, as the person who was aviation minister of this country for I think some three years and having received directly the non-stop lobbying of coalition members and senators for the construction of the third runway, as originally predicated, even with the cynicism that does afflict politics from time to time, this is a piece of breathtaking opportunism that really is in a class of its own. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, the decision was taken the year before I became a minister. But the job I got immediately given to me by the then Minister for Transport, Kim Beazley, was to have the carriage of the EIS process. After having had 100 briefings and meetings with Ken Hills and transparencies and overhead projections to burn, I am very familiar with the fact that the coalition would now like to forget that the entire operation was predicated on a lessened use of the east-west runway and the full use of the two parallel runways at Sydney airport leading to an increase, a change in the noise patterns, around the north and south of Sydney airport and a reduction in the noise experienced by those to the east and the west.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole atmosphere that has now been created by the opposition&mdash;and here it is in front of us in terms of reopening the east-west runway, which I might add has never been closed and is not closed as we speak; and I will talk about that in a minute&mdash;is that somehow or other this was an unforeseen consequence when in fact the whole thing was predicated from day one on traffic to the north and south and less traffic to the east and west. That was always going to be the case. Now the opposition, on the road to Damascus and with a sniff of polling day in front of it, wants to more equitably share the distribution of the noise around Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go over in detail what has been said in the past; it is all here on the public record, and it condemns the opposition with every single line. The Leader of the Opposition has been much quoted in terms of the full-blooded support he gave for the construction of the third runway. I will not go over all those quotes again, and the absolutely dismissive position that he took on concerns about noise. That is an accurate description of all the comments he made. I will not read them out again; it is all there on the public record. I can add to that, and I want to add to that, the non-stop representations I received as the minister who was oversighting the progress of the EIS and the actual construction from opposition senators and members for the construction of this runway as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can go one step further than that. I do not know whether it has been canvassed in the debate. I followed as closely as I could all the speakers but I missed out bits and pieces. I recall Senator Margetts very well, and not only the full-blooded support for the opening of the east-west runway but the active consideration on a number of occasions by the opposition of the removal of the curfew at Sydney airport. That is how far they wanted to go. The reason I recall it is that I had to, not on one and not on two occasions, but on half a dozen occasions, make categorical statements as aviation minister that we would not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have now got a bunch of political opportunists&mdash;and that is what they are&mdash;making hay, as they think, while the sun shines in Sydney, and saying `Oh, isn't it terrible, the noise', and `Here is the solution to it', in what is one of the most irresponsible pieces of legislation that has ever come into this parliament. I will explain why in a minute. They are saying: `Let us forget about the days when we supported the construction of the third runway and let us forget about the days when we were lobbying the government for the removal of the curfew at Sydney airport and for 24-hour-a-day operations at Sydney'&mdash;not just the conservatives here in the federal parliament but their colleagues in the state parliament of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As aviation minister I can pull these statements out, but I do not need to because, as those senators who have been involved in this debate for some time know, I had to on behalf of the government on a number of occasions assert very strongly that we would not give any consideration to such a proposition to remove the curfew from Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having disposed of that little piece of history, let us turn to how tissue-thin the opposition's case is on what I said when it was mooted&mdash;and I say it now in this debate&mdash;is one of the most irresponsible legislative propositions in a real sense that has ever been brought into a parliament. I was not joking, Senator Parer, when I said that I had constructed in my mind the potential royal commission that might be held into the first major accident at Sydney airport for whatever reason. The nature of hindsight and royal commissions is that it would not matter what the circumstances were about that accident if that accident occurred, for any reason, as a result of simultaneous operations at Sydney airport. I was the minister when this much talked about incident occurred at Sydney airport and I have never forgotten that day. In 1991 there weren't parallel runways at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to rewrite history when that statement was made, what I have said consistently is, `Yes, you can operate intersecting runways safely but parallel runways are inherently safer.' I have always said that. The reason I have said it is on the basis of advice that I received then and have received now&mdash;it is consistent advice&mdash;from people who know far more about it than I do, the people in charge of actual air safety and air regulation at Sydney airport and air traffic control and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, an organisation for whose professionalism and expertise I have very high regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to tell you this, Senator Margetts, in terms of the outrageous proposition that this Senate, this parliament, is going to run air traffic control at Sydney airport against the advice of the regulatory authority that actually runs it at Sydney airport and against the direct advice provided to this committee that Senator Macdonald has talked about from Dr Lee. Have a look at it. I will tell what you BASI said to me consistently about simultaneous operations. Dr Rob Lee said consistently: `Yes, you can operate intersecting runways safely, but in order to do it safely you would have to reduce the actual frequencies at the airport.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what he and others in BASI have said to me, and I have never forgotten it, `Well, if you're going to operate simultaneous operations on intersecting runways with frequencies of up to 80 an hour, good luck.' That is what they said. This is what the opposition has said. Have a listen, Senator Macdonald; you have not read the report, and I know it. I was astonished to see a press statement put out by John Howard, grabbing at this particular straw that went floating past, by saying that the US consultants Flight Transportation Associates report advocated the use of the three runways. I immediately got on to the Department of Transport and said, `Surely, this couldn't be the same report that was done in 1989. There must be another one,' but they said, `No, it's the same report.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you how tissue thin the opposition's position on safety grounds is, and Senator Parer knows this.

The report was prepared in 1989&mdash;this is what John Howard is relying on&mdash;as a theoretical computer modelling exercise of capacity options at the airport. It does not represent a detailed analysis of operational or safety issues. The introduction to this report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capacity of the airport under existing conditions and under a number of number of hypothetical future alternatives has been estimated. It should be emphasised that examination of a hypothetical alternative does not imply that this scenario has been deemed feasible with respect to engineering, economic, environmental, statutory or other aspects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is fascinating. I did not know there was a later one. I will have a look at that. Additionally, to achieve the high movement rates comparable to what can be achieved under a parallel runway system the modelling assumes that the terminal location at Sydney airport is actually between the two parallel runways&mdash;which, of course, it is not&mdash;and south of the east-west runway. It also envisages rapid exit taxiways off the east-west runway giving direct access to the terminal apron. This is necessary to enable all three runways to operate at the same time. Clearly, this is impractical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the scenarios modelled in the report involved the use of cross runways that rely on simultaneous operations. I might add one thing that this report does do, as you know, Senator Parer. In respect of capacity at the airport, the FTA report agrees with all of the experts the coalition has chosen to ignore, such as Airservices Australia, CASA, BASI, Department of Transport, Qantas and Ansett, that all of the crossing runway scenarios developed deliver less capacity than the independent use of the parallel runway system&mdash;all except the proposal that the airlines want to pursue of propeller aircraft off the eastern stub. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact the report indicates that operations as currently being undertaken at Sydney airport provide significantly greater capacity than any cross-runway configuration. Importantly, this capacity can be achieved without the less safe operation of cross runways. I have not got time now but I will take this much further in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by responding to the invitation I heard Senator Parer issue to me on the monitor that I should come in here and provide some evidence as to why the parallel runway system should continue to be used. I do not have to go further than BASI. Senator Parer, I am just astonished that you could be irresponsible enough&mdash;even though your leader is&mdash;just to ignore the advice of the Director of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, it is the organisation that gets to clean up the mess afterwards. It was the organisation that advised me about what it thought about simultaneous operations the day that collision almost occurred on that intersection at Sydney airport. We were about three seconds away from collision. Of course, we were only saved from it by the professionalism of that Ansett pilot that aborted his landing. This is what Dr Lee told the committee on this issue, in response to questions from Senator Forshaw:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason that crossing runways tend to be the norm at most of the older airports is that they date back from the days when aircraft had to take off into wind directly. As aircraft performance has improved, they are able to tolerate a greater cross-wind component, so the need for that very specific directional element of the airports is no longer there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the more modern airports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and have a look at them, Senator Macdonald&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which have been designed in recent years, they have virtually all gone for parallel runway configurations, the reason being that it removes the necessity for aircraft to either approach each other on converging or intersecting runways. There are not only runways which intersect but converging runways which, if you extend them, will meet further on at a point of intersection, which again provides an element of risk if two aircraft have to go around at once . . .</PARA>

The evidence is that, world-wide, where you can do it, parallel runways are the best option.</PARA>
<PARA>That is BASI's evidence to the committee. As I said&mdash;and I was not joking&mdash;this is a very brave piece of legislation you are asking us to put our names to. I have said before that I think this is the single piece of legislation that indicates that the whole of you lot are utterly unfit to govern this country. If you expect this parliament and this Senate to go against formal advice on the record from the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation in Australia that we should not go back to these intersecting runways and simultaneous operations, then you are really sticking your necks right out the window if you put yourselves in place of the air traffic control regime at Sydney airport and the investigatory body that advises it and the government on the most safe procedures to operate at Sydney airport.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some items in relation to the Advances to the Minister for Finance for the month of August 1995 which I find quite extraordinary and of considerable concern. They are matters that the Senate ought to look at in great detail, and I am sure they will on another occasion, but I want to draw it to the attention of the Senate at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter I draw attention to is the application by the Attorney-General's Department for a payment to meet an act of grace payment for the legal costs incurred by the former Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Mr Alan Griffiths, in respect of the inquiry into the so-called sandwich affair. You might remember that he owned a sandwich shop and difficulties arose with that. He resigned as a minister and there was then an inquiry conducted by Mr Michael Codd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not a judicial inquiry&mdash;it was not seeking evidence for the bringing of criminal charges or anything like that&mdash;it was an inquiry into the conduct of the minister. Despite that fact and despite the fact that the minister had already resigned, there were, I understand, something like $540,000 in legal costs incurred, which the government is going to get the taxpayers to foot the bill for. I think I am correct in saying that that $540,000 is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1995-96, which is presently before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application here from the Advance to the Minister for Finance was to make an interim payment of $150,000 to the solicitors Michael Brereton and Co., who were acting on behalf of Mr Griffiths. That $150,000 was required as an interim payment while they were sorting out how much was really going to be involved in the long run in all of this. We are told now that that figure is $540,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the circumstances of that quite extraordinary. Why the Australian taxpayer should be required to meet costs of that nature is a question that most Australian taxpayers would be asking very seriously. I am sure we are going to hear more about that as time goes on, particularly as the consideration of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) takes place in the days and weeks ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other item that I draw attention to is an application for funds for the Department of Defence to meet an operating subsidy for those parts of Aerospace Technologies of Australia which were not sold to Rockwell Systems Australia, RSA, when that company bought out ASTA earlier this year. There were certain parts they did not want. I think they got what they did get virtually for nothing because they said they would take them only on a debt-free basis. But there were certain operating activities that continued in the government's hands and they are requiring extraordinarily large government subsidies just to keep them afloat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The August Advance to the Minister for Finance statement detailed two separate payments&mdash;one of about $1 1/2 million and the other in the order of $2 million&mdash;and that is going to go on and on. We will find that in the September and subsequent applications as well. This is a classic example of a government not being able to get its act together in the operation of businesses. More importantly, what it has done has been to get rid of some assets for free and to leave the others at great operating cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point out again to the Senate that on 18 August, and again on 1 September, the delegate of the Minister for Finance approved Advances from the Minister for Finance&mdash;firstly, an amount of $1.56 million and, secondly, an amount of $1.1 million&mdash;to cover the operating costs of this business for four weeks, for just two fortnights ending 4 and 19 September respectively. Since then, the company has advised that, based on fortnightly cash flow projections, there were insufficient funds to meet operating expenses for the next fortnightly period&mdash;that is, the one ending 3 October&mdash;and on that basis there was a requirement for additional funding of another $1.5 million. It goes on to say in the accompanying documentation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional applications will be made as required based on fortnightly cash flow up to 31 October 1995 to meet ongoing operating costs comprising payments to creditors, group tax and salary payments.</PARA>
<PARA>Beyond 31 October it is not certain by any means that there will not be an ongoing requirement. In other words, an extraordinarily large amount of taxpayers' funds is required to meet these operating subsidies. As I said, an amount of something like $2 1/2 million or more each month is required for this process. I do not know how much attention has been given to that by the parliament. It was something that was announced by the government after the 1995-96 budget was released. The decision to do this was made in July. To my knowledge, it has escaped any detailed scrutiny by the parliament. I hope that the estimates processes that we are going through at the moment will allow at least some consideration of this. It is yet another example of how this government can take decisions outside the normal processes of government which lead to a very expensive use of taxpayers' money often without the sufficient scrutiny that the taxpayers of Australia and the electors of Australia would expect this parliament to undertake. </PARA>

But a rose by any other name smells just as sweet and, similarly, a consumption tax, be it called a GST or a consumption tax, still taxes the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has occurred is that Paul Keating&mdash;or the Prime Minister, Mr Keating&mdash;promised to the people no GST, yet has gone about collecting a consumption tax from the people and is now raising more in indirect taxes than the people of Australia would have needed to pay had the GST been introduced. The scale of the sales taxes paid in returns shown on pages 408 and 409 of the document we are discussing highlights the huge amount of taxes that are being collected by a whole number of businesses, from motor vehicles to tyres and recaps, boats, household appliances, household hardware, domestic furniture, household drapery, blinds, curtains, floor coverings, even bicycles. Chances are not many rich people would get around on bicycles, other than Mr McLeay, of course, other than the then Speaker, who got an extra $70,000. That is part of the Labor Party's commitment to equity and social justice, that the rich Speaker of the House of Representatives could get another $70,000 for falling off a bike that he should not have been on in the first place. But I have sidetracked myself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It once again highlights the hypocrisy of Labor's taxation policies&mdash;on aerated waters and cordials, insecticides, confectionary, soaps and detergents. Indeed, Senator Calvert interjected that surely it would not apply to toilet paper. Yes, it does. No matter what, if you buy it, Labor want to tax it. Under us the essentials of food would not have been taxed, but under Labor they are still being taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I make this contribution is that places such as New Zealand that have introduced a proper regime of indirect taxation are now reaping the rewards. They have an unemployment rate lower than ours. Their economy is burgeoning, is growing, is providing jobs and is paying off their international debt. At the end of this year they will be in credit as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then look at our record. It is a shameful record. The point that needs to be stressed is that under Labor's sales tax regime and indirect tax regime they are collecting more money&mdash;I stress `more money'&mdash;than a GST would have collected. That shows the hypocrisy of Labor. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry, I was perfectly relaxed. You, however, worked yourself into a frenzy because you could see that you were never going to make that high ministerial office that you seek, because Labor is going to lose the next election. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was undoubtedly of the same view, which is why he did not make that short drive out to Yarralumla and seek to have an election called and to put the matter of his stewardship, and the Labor Party's stewardship, of the Australian economy to the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some matters that are deserving of comment on the conduct of the so-called phoney election campaign and, more importantly, on the conduct of the Labor Party generally. I want to take this opportunity to record my absolute and utter abhorrence of some of the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister in relation to the ethnic community in this country. Honourable senators know that I only infrequently rise in this place to deal with matters to do with ethnic Australians, not because I do not have any regard for them but rather because I believe that the best interests of the community are served by serving the community as a whole. However, there are times when it is important that there is a voice for the ethnic community in this parliament, and on those occasions I have never shirked from my responsibility to represent the ethnic communities of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear here in this chamber tonight that the most disgusting comments of the Prime Minister in relation to the Chinese community have been treated by most of the ethnic Chinese population of this country as an insult to their intellect. For the Prime Minister of this country dishonestly to say that Chinese Australians know that John Howard will put them on a boat back to wherever they came from if he wins the election was the most outrageous, shameful, disgraceful and overblown piece of paranoid propaganda that I have heard in this parliament for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that my friend Senator Panizza has come into the chamber. He has a long association with the ethnic Italian community of this country and he, I am sure, would be just as shocked if the Prime Minister said that a coalition victory would mean that all the ethnic Italians in this country would be put on a boat and sent back. My friend Senator Abetz would be just as shocked, and the ethnic German community would be just as shocked, if the Prime Minister said, `Oh, well, the coalition under Mr Howard would put all the Germans on a boat back to the country from which they came.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the funny thing is that many ethnic Chinese like me did not come here in a boat. We did not come here in a plane. We did not come here in any way other than the most normal of deliveries: we were born in this country. They cannot send us back. There is nowhere we can go to. Of course, this shows the Prime Minister's ignorance of the ethnic diversity of this nation. An enormous number of the people that he likes to classify as `ethnic Chinese'&mdash;which he is going to scare with some dreadful tale about Mr Howard chopping them up or eating their children or whatever the paranoid delusion happens to be this week&mdash;are, of course, people who were born in this country. Where does the Prime Minister suppose that I am going to be sent? Where does the Prime Minister suppose my brother and my sister are going to be sent? This is the most ridiculous paranoia that I have heard, but this is the extent to which the Prime Minister is willing to go to divide the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was not the first attempt to kick the race can&mdash;and they are not my words, they are the Prime Minister's words&mdash;this was not even the second attempt; it was the third attempt in less than two months to `kick the race can', as the Prime Minister put it&mdash;not too eloquently, I may add, but that is his way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say that, if the Prime Minister wants to kick the race can, he should first start by kicking the bigotry out of the Australian Labor Party. There is a member in the other place who sat with me on a plane, on a fairly long flight I am afraid to say, from one Australian city to another during which period of time he asked me what I was doing in this country. My response was quite simple: I was born in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if members of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives are to be allowed to ask every ethnic Chinese or every ethnic Italian what they are doing in this country, then I do not think it sends out a very good signal as to the sort of tolerance that one can expect from the Labor Party. I think it sends out a signal that says that the Labor Party is only interested in the ethnic communities so long as they get their vote. They are not interested in respect. They are not interested in valuing those people for themselves or for the contribution they make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You get asked, `How long have you been in the country?' The funny thing is, of course, that my family has been in this country since at least 1888 on my father's side and probably earlier&mdash;my grandmother was born in this country in 1888. Of course, my family has been in this country longer than that of the member in the other place who had asked me the question. That is the ironic thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had Senator McKiernan who said on radio in Perth that there was a conspiracy between the coalition, the National Civic Council, the lawyers and the refugee organisations to populate northern Australia with Asians. This is the same senator who said that we were about to be deluged by hundreds of thousands of boat people from China and other Asian countries. In the eight months that have elapsed since then, Australia has not been deluged by hundreds of thousands of boat people. It is another Labor paranoid delusion, but it was whipped up to create a fear of one section of the community by another section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister wants to play the race card, he is welcome to play the race card. But, first of all, if he wants any credibility, he has to publicly&mdash;publicly&mdash;chastise and reprimand the people in his own party who have been the major causes of intolerance in ethnic affairs in this country in the time that I have been in parliament. There is only one source of bigotry in parliament on these issues and it is the Labor Party, and that has been demonstrated by the facts, demonstrated by their public utterances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister wants to pretend he is some sort of great saviour. He is not. He is just fanning the fires. I think the ethnic communities of this country should know that, whilst the Prime Minister says one thing to them, the members of his party are out saying another thing to the bigots in this community, to the vested interest groups that they want to prop up. That is the way the Labor Party treats the ethnic communities of this country and I think it is disgusting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in starting, Madam Deputy President, I rarely get up and talk about issues to do with ethnicity or race or whatever because I believe that Australia is one of the most tolerant countries in the world and it is a place where race is rarely an issue. It has become an issue and is becoming an issue because of the thoroughly unacceptable behaviour of the Prime Minister. I believe it is time that decent people stood up to him and said, `Enough is enough. Stop this nonsense. Stop trying to divide Australians against Australians. It won't work.' More importantly, all the wonderful progress that has been made in this country is set back 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, probably 100 years. I just cannot understand why anybody would want to do it, except to say that this is typical of the behaviour of the Prime Minister. I believe that everybody in this country, and especially the people up in the press gallery, ought to be aware of these things the next time he opens his mouth and carries on like this. It is thoroughly unacceptable, and it is time it stopped. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to expand upon some comments I made this afternoon, following question time, regarding the issue of the actions of CRA. It will be recalled that in that debate I referred to the operations of the Peak Hill Gold mining company, a fully owned subsidiary of CRA. I also recall, following my remarks, Senator O'Chee rising to his feet and, after his usual personal attack upon anybody on this side of the chamber associated with the trade union movement, talking about so-called facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to illustrate some facts to the Senate tonight&mdash;and I am sure that Senator O'Chee should listen because, if he does, he will learn what the facts are. What I am about to quote gives a very good illustration of what the CRA Group of Companies is engaged in with the present industrial dispute at the Weipa mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1990, when I was the Assistant General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, the union was approached by a company called the Peak Hill Gold mining company. That company was represented by the Australian Mines and Metals Association, the major employer association representing mining companies in this country. It approached the union to seek negotiations for the establishment of a new goldmine in New South Wales, near Cobar. That mine was to be operated by a company known as Peak Hill Gold which was, as I said, a fully owned subsidiary of CRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a very important project not only to the company but to the nation. As was clearly spelt out in evidence given to the Industrial Relations Commission, this was to be the largest goldmine in New South Wales. In the course of the negotiations that commenced with the union, the company was seeking to establish a greenfield site with single union coverage. It wanted all of the benefits that it could seek through the enterprise bargaining process to make this a model site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company was looking for things like the operation of 12-hour shifts underground&mdash;usually unheard of in Australian mining industry. It was looking for aggregate salaries. It was looking for new ways of approaching employee relations on site for solving problems, for identifying work practices which may have been an impediment to activity and ensuring that they would not occur. This was, from the ground up&mdash;and from the ground down, I suppose I should say&mdash;a new approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote what was put to Commissioner Lawson when subsequently this agreement, that was ultimately reached, was put to the commission for approval. The company at the time was represented by Mr Graham Watson, who has some degree of fame in industrial relations circles as representing employers, namely CRA. This is a person with whom I have on many occasions argued across the table. The transcript states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MR WATSON:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . And perhaps I could start by explaining briefly what we propose to do today, and give a&mdash;a broad overview of the situation. Mr Commissioner, the Peak Gold Mine when completed will be the largest gold mine in New South Wales, and is one of the few major new resource developments taking place at the current time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed award agreed between the parties, is quite short and simple, but it encompasses a number of very important innovations derived from extensive negotiations between the parties, and extensive input from a range of persons, including a practical understanding of mining operations, and the application of modern human resource techniques.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, at a Greenfield site there are opportunities to plan and implement important innovations, and the parties have put in a tremendous amount of work into the development of a human resource philosophy, and the integration of the technology; the work organisation; the mining techniques; and the general approach to human resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We intend to demonstrate to the commission that the result is&mdash;is a credit to those involved, and in our submission fully deserves the support of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA>The parties being the union and the company. It was right at the initial stages of the development. There were very few employees employed at the time. As they were progressively employed they were given the opportunity and ultimately approved the agreement negotiated between the company and the union. They also called evidence in those proceedings from a Mr Hannigan, the manager of the mine, who said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peak has to sell its product on world markets. It doesn't compete within Australia, it competes overseas, and therefore that's where we have to be focused. After visiting Canada and the United States, all those mines were basically single union and were very effective in their man management, and I think we need to learn a little bit about what happens in countries such as Canada, because they are our major competitor as far as minerals are concerned with Australia. But that took us down to single unions, and after a lot of investigation it did become obvious that the AWU, who we ended up doing quite extensive negotiations with over a period of nine months, were really the only union . . . that we could see that had the constitutional coverage to undertake all the things that we were trying do. And, in fact, we found them quite responsive in their discussions, and the consequence is that we had this agreement which we would like to put in place.</PARA>
<PARA>This agreement was duly ratified by the commission and throughout the transcript of those proceedings praise was given by the company to the processes involved in negotiating this agreement with the union. It was approved in early 1991 and broke new ground in the mining industry. But what happened? About two years later the union suddenly received a bundle of resignation notices, all in the same form, quite unannounced. They just arrived. What did we discover? We discovered that the company had gone around and coerced the employees into signing up on individual contracts&mdash;individual contracts which took away many of their basic rights and which were the same for every single employee at the mine. These individual contracts that the opposition is so supportive of are all exactly the same. There is no individuality about them at all. The individual contract had a provision in it such as this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The employee agrees to abide by and adhere to the CRA group code of business conduct during the period of this contract of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>If you want full details of the code of conduct you find them in the employee handbook. What was one of the requirements in the employee handbook? If an employee joined an association whose objectives may somehow differ with those of the company then they were required to tell the company supervisor about it. That was a requirement in the individual contract. In other words, they were required to go and tell the company if they joined the union, even though the union was not allowed to represent them. The contract also said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company encourages the employee to participate in community affairs, provided that such participation does not interfere with the employee's personal effectiveness at work.</PARA>
<PARA>How generous of the company! They then had in their contract of employment clause of this individual contract:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This contract of employment is the result of direct discussions between the employee and representative of the company and supersedes all previous contracts and arrangements entered into between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA>On that occasion, having gone to the commission and having negotiated a consent agreement, having praised that agreement as being at the forefront of industrial relations in this country, having achieved the very things that would make that mine site productive, what did the company do? They tore it up and walked away from it and coerced the employees into individual contracts. That company is a fully owned subsidiary of CRA. They deceived the Industrial Relations Commission to the point where they used the processes to establish an award, then they walked away from it for no reason whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You say that the people have to abide by the laws of this country. The CRA company in that case totally flouted the Industrial Relations Commission award. We now have in Weipa a continuation of that long pursuit by the CRA to de-unionise its operations, to drive the union movement out of its sites&mdash;something that I have said is totally undemocratic and foreign to our way of life. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The article complained of was one written by Glen Milne in <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Australian</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The article continued, "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crichton-Browne's wife Esther was present for some of these negotiations. She made tea for Howard and, given the nature of the discussion, must have maximised the Liberal Leader's discomfort."</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to deal with problems that have emerged from a leaked Telstra internal memorandum, which I raised at question time today. There is no doubt that the savage spending cuts&mdash;I am not arguing whether they are justified or not&mdash;that have emerged from a changed view by Telstra of its revenues, its earnings before interest and tax and its cash flow, have some clear consequences, particularly for rural Australia and for all those Australians who are awaiting the upgrading of their telephone services to the digital operation that has been promised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latest annual report, for example, Telstra says that it aims to have 100 per cent digital cover by the year 2000. At the moment, about 62 per cent of the network has been digitised. When in question time today I said that this posed serious problems and a serious threat to the upgrading of the system which was required and which had been progressing at a rate which may well not be able to be sustained, for some extraordinary reason the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) pretended that this was some kind of attack on the diligence of the employees of Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assert now that this leaked Telstra memorandum has effectively ended prospects of the Australian telephone system being upgraded to a 100 per cent digital system by the year 2000, particularly in rural areas. The memo from the Chief Executive of Telstra, Frank Blount, revealed that Telstra would sack most contractors, stop recruitment of new staff, withdraw existing job offers and cut or postpone major projects. What we want to find out is whether the major project to upgrade the system to a 100 per cent digital network is at risk under these cuts. We got no indication from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Senator McMullan twice whether he would give an unequivocal guarantee that this upgrading program would not be cut, and he chose instead to suggest that I was somehow attacking Telstra employees. The only Telstra employees being attacked at the moment are those who are going to lose their jobs and the contractors who are going to be sacked as a result of these proposed arrangements. It is this government&mdash;not the opposition&mdash;that looks like getting stuck into Telstra workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, rural areas are falling behind the cities in this upgrading of the service to digital. The digital system is an enormous improvement and provides a far greater service than do the existing arrangements. It is a matter of some concern that there is an apparent threat to this program. Particularly in recent Senate estimates committees where Telstra has been dealt with, I have raised the question of whether or not Telstra's enormous expansion into non-core activities&mdash;particularly overseas and into various other enormously expensive activities in cable television and so on&mdash;was diminishing the funds available to upgrade the Australian telephone service, which, after all, is Telstra's main duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also concerned, as many senators have been, that Telstra has been required to pay just under $1 billion in dividends&mdash;a far greater proportion than normal&mdash;to the government in the latest year to help the government's budgeting problems. The government has plenty of budgeting problems. All the assets that were supposed to be sold do not look like being sold. Here it is milking Telstra to the extent that now major projects are going to be cancelled, according to Telstra's internal memo. Some are to be cancelled; some are to be cut severely; we do not know which ones yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is no doubt that major projects will be cut or postponed, because that is what the chief executive, Mr Blount, has said in this leaked memo that came to me today. It is from him to members of his executive committee. The memo was sent out on Sunday after an executive committee meeting last Friday. I think it is a disgrace that the government is not prepared to give an assurance that these severe Telstra spending cuts would not delay the digital upgrading program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of other spending cuts listed by Mr Blount. They are in promotion and advertising. Sponsorship activities will also be severely curtailed. This will be a serious blow to many organisations in Australia who have depended on Telstra for sponsorship. Just to cheer them up, I will read what the leaked memorandum from Mr Blount actually says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sponsorship activities will be severely curtailed. Except for those activities in this regard which are already firmly committed, we will immediately cease discussions or considerations on any other or additional sponsorships. We will not automatically renew any existing sponsorships until or unless they are completely reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA>On promotion and advertising the memo says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Promotion &amp; Advertising expenditures will be targeted to be reduced to the level which was actually spent in the previous fiscal year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .   . . .   . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Property Group will be instructed to see if there is any feasible way we can consider additional asset sales this year so as to bring about cash flow improvements.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope Telstra do their property sales better than the group of property sales they tried in Sydney recently where they were selling as subdivided lots land that had not had approval for subdivision and they were selling lots to the public that were contaminated. It was one of the greatest snafus that one could possibly expect. I hope that, if Telstra is going to go into the asset sale disposal business, it lifts its game. Mr Blount said in the memo:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will, in addition to these priorities for cutting or postponing major projects . . . examine more fully every substantive project or program to either postpone, refocus, or cancel.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us face it: making the network totally digital by the year 2000 is a major project, a substantive project. Is it going to be postponed, refocused or cancelled? These problems, I think, are very serious, because there is no doubt in my mind that Australian telephone users are now going to have to suffer the consequences of Telstra being forced to pay this huge dividend of just under a billion dollars to help out the government's budget problems and for its diversion of multi millions of dollars into non-core activities, particularly overseas. The memo says about the employment consequences:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will immediately move to much more stringently manage the intake of full time staff and of contractors . . . We will force the issue of reassignment of personnel within the Company as an absolute imperative and only in rare and exceptional cases will we be adding people to Telstra's payroll through recruitment from outside the Company. This means that any such endeavours must be immediately shut down (including university recruitment) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So university graduates who are hoping they might have a role to play in Telstra can forget it. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any pending offers to people outside the Company will have to be withdrawn . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It also says that people whose jobs have been declared redundant will be forced to accept other jobs within the organisation. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of contractors being utilised effectively for major project work, decisions will be made to pare back or eliminate some projects on a priority basis with the expectation that the service of contractors assigned to the projects which are eliminated or deferred will be terminated.</PARA>
<PARA>So there we have the great contribution of Telstra to the unemployment problem in Australia. Whether or not there are excepted employees is another matter; I do not know. But these are the facts. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
