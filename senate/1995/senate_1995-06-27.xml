<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are addressing a meat industry package of amendments to 14 bills. These bills are intended to give the meat industry a greater role and responsibility in deciding its own affairs and to move it to a less regulated environment. The government asked the Industry Commission to undertake a study into the meat industry. It reported in July 1994, pointing out that Australia produces livestock at a very low cost by international standards but efficient processing is necessary if Australia is to take full advantage of our comparative advantage in livestock production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report said that the reason Australia remained world competitive was that processors were able to buy livestock at very low prices compared with processors in other countries. This was recently borne out when it was found that US beef could be landed in Australia at competitive prices after paying cattle producers 60 per cent more for their livestock than the money received by Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 23 recommendations, three deal directly with industrial relations reforms; seven with the AMLC; seven with actions which the government should undertake in relation to market access and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service; one is a matter for local government; one concerns licensing; one is about R&amp;D; one recommends the restructuring of the Policy Council&mdash;this legislation; and one suggests the Policy Council investigate the scope for the AMLC to fund individual projects by way of direct charges to beneficiaries and concomitant reductions in general levies. In relation to its recommendations on a restructured Policy Council, the IC said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission considers that the AMLIPC should be restructured, that its membership should more directly reflect the views of levy payers and major stakeholders such as employees, with government and quasi-public bodies currently represented, such as AQIS, AMLC and MRC as non voting members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restructured in such a way, the AMLIPC would be able to play a valuable role in setting major policy priorities for the industry on an ongoing basis. Recommendations made by the Commission on the scope for project financing in the AMLC and the possible introduction of multiple export inspection standards should be considered by the AMLIPC, as could issues such as the benefits of an industry-wide system for grading of Australian meat sold in domestic and international markets. A restructured AMLIPC could also be responsible for undertaking external evaluation of the effectiveness of AMLC and MRC programs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Meat and Livestock Industry Bill 1995 is the major bill in this package. It establishes a new Meat Industry Council to replace the AMLIPC and redefines the roles of the AMLC and the MRC. The MIC&mdash;that is, the new Meat Industry Council&mdash;will be responsible for developing strategic industry policy which will then provide the framework under which the AMLC and MRC will develop their corporate and operational plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is transitional. It is to start on 1 July this year and will sunset on 30 June 1998. At that stage, it is intended that the three statutory industry authorities will revert to a non-statutory status. The government says that it will also enable the industry to identify its problems and devise commercial responses to them. In other words, the government expects it to implement the other recommendations of the Industry Commission because they are just too hard for the Labor government to implement. Under the government's industrial relations laws, this will not be possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MIC is to establish guidelines for evaluations of the AMLC and the MRC programs and review their corporate plans prior to submission to the minister. The MIC will also be responsible for funding the AMLC and the MRC through the power to recommend levy rates to industry annual general meetings. This will ensure that programs of the AMLC and the MRC conform with the industry's strategic direction laid down by the new MIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MIC will be accountable to the minister and parliament, and will have to produce a corporate plan and an annual report each year projecting three years ahead. The corporations will only be accountable to the MIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MIC is to be a body corporate, as it will be holding money on its own account and will have the ability to employ staff and consultants. It must hold an annual conference and organise an annual general meeting of each statutory body during the conference. At conferences there will be the discussion of broad industry concerns but no motions of a general industry nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the composition of the MIC. There are to be 18 members comprising a chairperson and government member. Both of these will be appointed by the minister, who will also appoint other members on the recommendations of the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, the Australian Meat Council, the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Livestock Exporters' Association, the Australian Lot Feeders' Association, the Australian Supermarket Institute Limited and other members prescribed by regulation. Before the appointment of a chairman, the minister must consult the above bodies, and a person employed by any of these bodies is not eligible for appointment as a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill deals with the AMLC. The objects of the AMLC are to promote, control, protect and further the interests of the industry with reference to the export of meat and livestock from Australia and the sale and distribution of these after export. Also included are promotion, control and furthering the interests of the industry with respect to interstate trade and commerce in meat and livestock, the improvement of meat and livestock products and the encouragement of meat consumption in Australian territories. Its functions are to improve meat and livestock production domestically, promote domestically and internationally the consumption and sale of Australian meat and the sale of Australian livestock, encourage and control meat and livestock exports from Australia, recommend to the minister on regulations in relation to licences for the export of meat and livestock, and grant or refuse export licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MIC takes over the AMLC's previous function relating to recommendations to the minister for levy and charge rates. However, the AMLC will be able to charge fees for services. It will also be able to market goods other than meat and livestock so that private equity can be introduced into CALM or Ausmeat and these services can be used for other species. It is intended that CALM will eventually be fully privatised, but its current restrictions make it less marketable. These types of plans must be explained in the AMLC's corporate plan, which requires ministerial approval and agreement of MIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMLC must conform to the broad policies of the MIC and must keep a register of levy and charge payers to determine eligibility to attend general meetings and conferences and voting rights. Powers to be removed from the AMLC are the funding of industry bodies for consultation purposes, ability to trade in meat and livestock, and ability to set conditions on the shipping of meat and livestock from Australia. The AMLC will consist of seven members and, with the exception of the managing director, all will be part time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Generally speaking, the Australian meat processing sector is not internationally competitive in its operation due to high labour and capital costs compared with those of our major competitors. Despite the inefficiencies in our  processing sector, the Australian meat industry has been able to remain price competitive. This has been achieved by paying Australian producers less for their livestock than their overseas counterparts receive. These facts are borne out by a report prepared for the Meat Research Corporation by Booze Allan and Hamilton in 1993. The Meat Research Corporation study also shows that productivity in Australian meatworks is abysmal compared with that of overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inefficiencies of the beef processing sector were again highlighted by the Industry Commission in its 1994 report, which recommended a major overhaul of work arrangements. Despite the findings of these two reports and numerous others over the years, the government has chosen to ignore them in responding to the Industry Commission report. Instead, it concentrated on a narrow group of recommendations about the industry's administrative structure, which although useful will do nothing to boost international competitiveness in the meat industry. The key IC recommendations in this regard were those to establish a minimum rates award, preferably nationally; the abolition of the tally system; and greater flexibility in working hours and hiring conditions for all plant to be used for longer periods. The proposed minimum rates award was to be used as the basis for enterprise bargaining but has still not been instituted, except in a very small number of works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union has been running a major industrial campaign under which it has sought wage rises of at least four per cent before it will begin enterprise negotiations. Several companies have agreed. Recently, my colleague the shadow minister for primary industries, Mr John Anderson, made public the findings of a consultant's view of progress in work place reform in the export meat processing sector. It was conducted by Fellows Medlock and Associates for the Department of Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report was highly critical of progress to date. Among its conclusions were that enterprise bargains achieved to date have not been particularly innovative nor successful in encouraging improvements at the plant level. In many cases, they have been little more than a means to achieve a general wage rise. The industry's individual employers generally display a traditional and narrow approach to relations with their employees, and unions have failed to acknowledge change where it has occurred. Also, the union has adopted a narrow view of enterprise bargaining and has been reluctant to allow direct discussions between management and employees. Of course, all of these issues pose a number of questions that require further and detailed consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly aware that there have been representations from wide groups, and at the committee stage I will ask the minister for clarification of the issues raised by the Australian Council of Livestock Agents, which has sought undertakings from Minister Collins with regard to observer status on the Meat Industry Council. I note in a letter to the minister that the Australian Council of Livestock Agents stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand that observer status will allow ACLA to attend all meetings, receive minutes and agendas, and participate in all discussions. We acknowledge however that we would not have voting rights. We would welcome confirmation of the above.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that, as of yesterday, that council is still looking for a response to that. We also need to ask the question: when will the government acknowledge that its policy is failing so badly that it threatens not just Australia's export potential but also our capacity to import and replace, and, therefore, the prosperity and jobs of battlers as well as farmers?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, 14 bills. I think that the size of the package is not an accurate reflection on the quality of the legislation. There has been a lot of window dressing and some adoption of the IC recommendations, but the real work remains to be done. The shadow minister for primary industries, John Anderson, has said that it is a totally inadequate response to the Industry Commission inquiry into the meat industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was intended to give the industry a great self-determining role, and the key point is the establishment of a new Meat Industry Council. It is responsible for developing industry policy&mdash;as Senator Tambling has so eloquently said&mdash;overseeing the AMLC and the MIC and assessing its funding requirements. Interestingly, it is also supposed to identify industry problems and devise commercial responses to them. In other words, it is doing the government's job because the government cannot tackle issues such as labour reform within the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Costs in Australia are absolutely astronomical compared with other countries. One of the costs associated with meat processing in Australia is about $170 a carcass. Compare that with the cost in New Zealand, who we compete with for the markets of Japan and Korea. Its cost for the carcass is about $70, so there is a heck of a difference between the two countries, and it puts us at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's record of cost efficiency in meat processing is basically appalling compared with some of the other countries. The Booz Allen study shows Australia to be way above the US and New Zealand and even higher than Argentina. Argentina, with the foot-and-mouth business getting under control a little now, will be competitive with us in the future, as will Uruguay. We have to compete against those countries, so we have to get a lot better. We cannot remain uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overview of the IC report has made some different points about meat processing costs. One of them says that the results indicate that processing costs in Australia are higher than those in other countries with which Australia potentially competes. It is not only me that is saying this; it is the Industry Commission report that is also saying it. We have got to go somewhere along the lines of fixing that up so we can become more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Meat Industry Council will also have to tackle questions of Australia's move to quality assurance inspection, and it will need to examine current and future methods of selling and marketing both domestically and for exports. For those two, we have to develop different techniques and different movements for the future as we move into the post-GATT trade environment under the World Trade Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some criticism of the council. The first is the size and composition of the council itself&mdash;and I think that one could argue that 18 is rather large but, obviously, there are difficulties when determining who should be in and who should be out. With regard to the 18 members, including the peak commodity councils, there is some argument about whether the livestock agents ought to be included or not. I think that argument will continue for quite some time. There is a sunset clause to the legislation, so there will be a further opportunity to re-examine the composition in 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major criticism of the package is that it is simply inadequate. The meat industry has to become efficient in a hurry. The year 2000 is only 4 1/2 years away and we need to be ready to capitalise on new market opportunities. We will not be able to do that with the impediments we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overview of the IC report says it all. The industry has significant scope for growth. For the rest of the decade it will enjoy progressively improving access to export markets as a result of the recent Uruguay Round of GATT. Access to the United States will improve markedly, although for some years the Australian industry will have difficulty in fully taking up the access negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IC says that access to north Asian markets, such as Japan and the Republic of Korea, will also gradually be liberalised over the rest of the decade, allowing significant export growth. It also says that the major threats facing the industry relate to competition from other meat producing countries. Some of our competitors, such as New Zealand, are lifting productivity at a rapid rate, while others, such as a number of South American countries, will pose an even bigger competitive threat when they are granted foot-and-mouth disease-free status&mdash;which, as I have already mentioned, is something we will have to take into account. As a beef producer myself, and as somebody who has been in the industry for a long time, I think that if we do not get that right, we will jeopardise our balance of payments, which is absolutely abysmal at the moment, because we will not be able to maintain market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that impacts on the industry as much as anything else is the performance of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. At the moment there is an inquiry into that. In the move towards quality assurance, we cannot afford to have any doubts about the efficacy of our premier inspection body. But there are widespread complaints in various rural industries about AQIS. Certainly, within the meat industry, complaints are rife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, at the inquiry in Sydney, the New South Wales Regional Abattoirs Association talked of the problems it has with meat inspection and how that should be cleaned up. I know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, supports the inquiry. Hopefully, when the report is brought down these matters will be fixed up. If it comes down after the next election, it will be something that Mr Anderson, the member for Gwydir, will be able to fix up as the new minister for primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IC report also said that we should do something about our selling methods. I am not saying that everyone should move to CALM but, obviously, a lot of the handling of stock on the way to the abattoirs is a bit antiquated and we might have to look at that if we are to become more cost effective and cost efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must make sure that our meat research dollar is spent in the most effective way. Recently, there has been criticism of grant allocations. Obviously, the debate surrounding that will go on for quite some time. One area that must be fixed up&mdash;not just by the window-dressing of changing some authorities and that sort of thing&mdash;is that of meat processing costs. If we do not do something about that we will not be competitive in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meat industry is a wonderful industry and it is up to us as legislators to do something more to bring about labour market reforms in an industry which produces great export income. Without labour market reform in the abattoirs and in the whole of the handling chain, it will not be cost competitive and the industry will suffer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to make some brief comments in relation to the Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill 1995 and associated bills. In this package there are some 11 different bills. I particularly wish to deal with the meat and livestock industry reforms, with particular emphasis on the cattle industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do that against the background of three things. One is the Harrison report of some years ago. One is the Industry Commission report of more recent times. One is something that should have brought home a message to us all recently, and that is when we found that US beef could be brought into and sold in Australia at prices competitive with those of Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That highlights the fact that there is something very dramatically wrong in Australia. We are a major exporter of beef, but when things became a little difficult during the drought we saw beef imported into this country from the United States even though plenty of beef was available in Western Australia. The simple reason is that the meat industry and the government have not had the courage to address the issues that were raised in the Harrison report or in the Industry Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is very simple. I asked this question when I first came into the Senate in 1990: why does it cost $180 to kill and process a beast in Australia when it costs only approximately $85 to $90 in the United States and $50 in South American and other major exporting countries? That is the crux of the matter. We have to ensure that Australia's beef industry prospers and grows. Because Australia has not been prepared to address that particular aspect, our producers will continue to receive much lower prices than those received by our cousins in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because this has occurred we have seen the development of the live cattle trade. Many cattle are being exported from the Kimberley in Western Australia, from the Northern Territory, and, more recently, from Queensland. Producers receive a better return by exporting live cattle to countries such as Indonesia where they are put in feedlots and processed. That is costing Australian jobs. It has created the situation in Australia where the industry is not expanding as it should be. The impact of value adding and marketing processed product overseas should be increasing our export dollars to offset the imports coming into the country. At the moment Australia is economically worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be brought home to us at the end of this week when we will see, once again, a $2.5 billion current account deficit. One of the reasons this figure is continuing to grow is the inaction in the meat industry. It is being predicted that this month's current account deficit will be the worst in Australia's history. As has been well said, we are well down the path to the Mexican scenario in terms of our current account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, has been trying to blame the opposition for any possible increase in interest rates in the near future. That is one of the greatest furphies that has ever been tried on this parliament and on the people of Australia. The fact is that what happens to the current account will put pressure on interest rates. Until such time as we have the courage to address some of the problems I have highlighted with the meat industry&mdash;which is consistent with many other industries&mdash;we will continue to have a current account that stays at similar levels; thus we will continue to have close to the highest real interest rates in the world. The government has to wake up to that, otherwise the situation will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the formation of yet another committee in the meat industry. Over the years I have been amazed at the number of committees and structures that have been set up in this industry to supposedly address the issues. I have no faith whatsoever that this Meat Industry Council will do any better than its predecessors. There is no reason to suspect or believe that it will do any better. It is just window dressing; walking away from the real issues which exist in the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks through the explanatory memorandum one finds such things as the continuation of the AGM in the industry. That is the greatest nonsense that has ever been thrust on the Australian meat industry&mdash;or any other sector of industry that goes through this particular process. It is absolutely impossible for producers to be involved other than on a very cursory and simple level if the AGM happens to be held in their particular town at a particular time. Western Australia is a significant producer of beef&mdash;though not as large a producer as Queensland. This measure totally isolates Western Australia from the decision making process. The process concerning the AGMs does not carry any real weight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that we looked at a proper and effective representative base for the production side of the industry. Until such time as we effectively address the reforms that are required in the slaughtering and processing of meat in this country we are going to find ourselves at a significant disadvantage when competing on the world market. We will continue to see increasing imports of beef. This should not occur because we should be able to compete favourably against other countries in price and quality. We will continue to see jobs in the meat industry being taken offshore to our northern neighbours. We will see more live cattle being exported and being slaughtered and processed elsewhere. We might even have the ridiculous case not too far down the track where we will find that meat which is being processed offshore is being imported back into Australia for the Australian consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those comments, the challenge is really for the government&mdash;or, after the next election, as Senator Brownhill said, for us&mdash;to address these key issues in the meat industry and allow it to thrive on its own merits, which it has the capacity to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank opposition speakers for their contributions. I do not agree with some of the points that have been made in the debate. However, the opposition is supporting the legislation and has facilitated its passage as non-controversial legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address and put on the record a number of matters. Senator Brownhill put the wrong emphasis on one aspect of this legislation, in asserting that the role of the MIC is to oversee the operations of the AMLC and the MRC. It is not the intention of the design of the legislation for the MIC to oversee both the AMLC and the MRC. The role is rather a strategic one, with the AMLC and the MRC having greater flexibility to manage and implement programs within the context of the industry strategic plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of constant themes in the contributions from senators opposite were the issues of industrial relations and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. As mentioned, the Industry Commission inquiry into meat processing did deal with these matters to varying degrees. The point I want to make about these two issues, both industrial relations and the quarantine service, is that they are being pursued, but they are being pursued under separate processes and they are not the subject of specific reforms under this legislation. Nevertheless, this legislation addresses well over half of the recommendations made by the Industry Commission and, indirectly, other recommendations will be pursued under the new statutory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Meat Industry Council, established by this legislation, is an appropriate body to develop strategic policy and planning to address industry costs and competitiveness issues. Representatives of producers, processors and the union are on the council. The interim council has already identified industry cost as a priority issue and is in the process of finalising research to assist with its strategic assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is fully aware that improved workplace relations can contribute to lifting the productivity and efficiency of the meat processing sector. Progress on enterprise agreements is being made, but from a low base. The recent report commissioned by the Department of Industrial Relations found that, in general, despite efforts by some employers and union officials, the work force was sceptical and distrustful of change. In the context of industrial relations, it needs to be understood that enterprise bargaining is not about imposing change from above on the work force and the employers; it is about a cultural shift by the work force itself together with its employer. Government's role is to set out a framework within which that cultural shift can occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report to which I was referring found that the industrial relations climate has improved and that the number of enterprise agreements is increasing. But the quality of the agreements does vary. Some areas of Australia&mdash;for example, Victoria&mdash;have had more experience in this type of negotiation than other areas in Australia. The steady increase in federal agreements shows the viability of the government's framework for conducting and supporting enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, it is the commitment of the parties to enterprise bargaining that is important, not government imposing from above change on the parties, particularly in an industry which has had deep traditions of scepticism&mdash;and that would be putting it mildly in terms of the attitudes of the parties in this industry&mdash;in the area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service over the past two years has been very significant, certainly since I have been parliamentary secretary to, firstly, Mr Simon Crean and now Senator Bob Collins. I do not want to spend a lot of time on this issue in the debate today, but I think it was Senator Brownhill who acknowledged that he is involved in a further review of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. We remain firmly committed to the ongoing reform of the quarantine service. There have been major changes, such as the downsizing of the work force by some 500. There have been significant changes and, in many areas, reductions in the charges made by AQIS. </PARA>

In his summing up comments a few moments ago, the minister referred to the report that had been prepared for the Department of Industrial Relations by Fellows Medlock and Associates. I understand that this was an independent review of progress into workplace reform in the meat processing sector. Would the minister acknowledge that that report established that those few enterprise bargains that have been achieved to date, in the context of the report, lack `innovation', fail to `encourage significant improvement at the plant level' and `generally have been little more than a means to achieve a general wage increase'? I ask the minister: what action is being proposed to redress these issues and how will the government ensure that its own policy will not threaten export potential but does complement the objectives that we are seeking?</PARA></TALK.START>

It has not occurred as rapidly as some parties and some employers would like to have seen. Set against the context of our general industrial relations reforms, which have put much greater emphasis on enterprise bargaining, as I said earlier, it is not for government&mdash;other than to set the regulatory framework for enterprise bargaining in the context of industrial relations, which we have done&mdash;to get together the employees, the union and the employers and sit them around a table and bang their heads together and say, `Look, get on with it'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill amends the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991. The principal act ensures that the total of the annual telecommunications carrier licence fees must not exceed the total cost of running the industry regulator, Austel, in the previous financial year. This amendment changes the upper fee limit. It will allow the government to also recover the cost of Australia's contribution to the International Telecommunications Union. It is the implication of this that I want to particularly dwell on today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's policy has been to make Australian carriers fund the cost of the regulator, Austel. In 1994-95 Telstra, Optus and Vodaphone paid $12.6 million in carrier licence fees to cover the costs of running Austel. The coalition supports making the carriers pay for the regulator while maintaining a ceiling that prevents carrier licence fees producing a surplus that could be transferred to general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Telecommunications Union also has fees which have to be covered. This body is a United Nations body and its role is to prescribe world telecommunications standards and radio communications planning. So it is appropriate that the government pay fees to this body and it is also appropriate that the government recover those fees from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to 1991, Telecom, OTC and Aussat paid the government's ITU contribution. Now the carriers make their own separate ITU contributions and the government pays a contribution. This was $4.86 million in 1993-94. This amendment raises the ceiling on the money paid by the carriers in licence fees to recover the costs of government in the contribution to the ITU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of this bill will be favourable because, the government's payments to ITU having been transferred back to the industry, the general burden on the taxpayer will be reduced. So the coalition favours these arrangements. We do not oppose the bill but there are a number of implications about what is happening in relation to fees and charges in the international area that should be brought to the Senate's attention because the legislation is going to impact on the costs of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The government believes that the likely level of ITU fees in the future is going to increase. The extent of this is unpredictable because it depends on the activities of the ITU. This is difficult to gauge into the future because the very rapid evolution of the telecommunications revolution means that such an international body will play a larger and larger role in international telecommunications. This means there will probably be an increase in fees in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that would actually increase the cost to the carriers and, ultimately, the consumers is the fact that these fees are paid in Swiss francs. Changing exchange rates can put up the costs quite significantly as they have done when things have been paid in Swiss francs in the past, given the strength of that currency relative to the weakness of the Australian currency. All this places the industry under an increased cost burden. The size of the carriers' contributions will be determined from time to time by regulation. I believe that this needs to be watched closely by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition has a number of concerns relating to the way in which the government has arrived at its position on this bill. It is disturbing that none of the carriers appears to have been consulted about the bill. The coalition did consult with all the carriers. Given what I have said so far, the Senate would not be surprised to learn that the carriers are less than enthusiastic about covering the payments that were formerly made by the government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that way, Senator Boswell. It seems that the government has determined, without so much as a by-your-leave, that the carriers should cover this international charge. The coalition does not disagree with the principle of the carriers covering it, but one would have thought it to be courtesy to consult and discuss with the carriers the implications of this bill, particularly as it affects the bottom line of all the carriers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also no provision for a reduction in the fees the carriers pay to the government in the light of the fact that they are now covering the cost to the ITU. It should be noted that a carrier like Telstra, because of its size, will carry the bulk of offsetting these increased licence fees and will be cutting its present ITU contribution accordingly. But the bottom line is that its overall cost level will go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contribution to the operation of the ITU is quite high, relative to the size of our economy. We support in principle the carriers paying telecommunications licence fees to recover public interest regulatory costs incurred by Austel. We also recognise the need to pay our way internationally. Nevertheless, the impact of the increase in licence fees to take account of the international contributions that are needed should be assessed carefully. The coalition supports this bill before the Senate. </PARA>

However, the report of the evaluation of Australia's ITU involvement, which has now been widely distributed, includes reference to attributing cost recovery of the contribution. </PARA>

Further, the department is writing to the telecommunications carriers to fully explain the attribution and cost recovery of ITU expenses. As has been mentioned in the debate, the result of this legislation will be a reduction of approximately $1 million in costs and return to industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 1995 and the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Amendment Bill 1995 represent the second stage of the government's reforms to the departure tax system. In the 1994-95 budget, the government announced that it would replace the departure tax with a passenger movement charge, which is a $27 tax on international passenger movement. The new charge is linked to the cost of providing customs, immigration, quarantine and short-term visitor visa processing services. It is a form of hypothecation without hypothecation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced that the charge will be collected through the airlines rather than the cumbersome departure tax booths that have long been an irritation to international travellers and a bit of an eyesore at the airports. The government implemented the new system in the Departure Tax Amendment Act 1994 and the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Act 1994. It did not, however, update the exemptions to the tax that were available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old system defined 24 categories of international passengers who were exempt from the charge. The categories were awkwardly split between the act and the regulations. These bills will replace those 24 categories with 12 broadly defined categories to facilitate the collection of the charge by the airlines and to clarify the operation of the new system. The new categories will take effect from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills will also implement a range of transitional amendments. For instance, a passenger who already holds an exemption stamp issued under the old system for a departure after July 1995 will not be reassessed under the new arrangements. The bills will eliminate a number of exemption categories that were available under the old system. For example, members of the ADF travelling on official duty will no longer be exempt from the charge. The charge will instead have to be met by the Department of Defence. The elimination of exemption categories like this one reflect the transformation of the departure tax from a general revenue measure to a charge for service. The bills also tighten the exemption category relating to transit passengers. I believe that this is expected to raise an extra $1.5 million in 1995-96. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is an important piece of legislation and one which is supported by the coalition. Basically, this bill seeks to add to the schedule and therefore confirm the basic tenets of an agreement which was reached between the Central Land Council, the traditional owners of the area covered by the Western Desert (South) Repeat Land Claim and the Northern Territory government. I think the important part of this legislation is that it puts into law what honourable senators on all sides of this chamber would recognise as a healthy and productive process, where issues can be concluded by agreement with a large dose of commonsense and certainly without having to go through the tedious and lengthy processes set down under the Native Title Act&mdash;processes which can take years and years for Aboriginal applicants, mining companies or any other persons wanting to use land to go through the very complicated and complex processes tied up in the Native Title Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are all aware in this chamber that the processes under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act are very lengthy. Firstly, hearings are conducted by the commissioner, then there is an investigation of the claims, and then determinations are made and reported to the minister and the Northern Territory government. Then the minister would recommend to the Governor-General whether or not the land in question should be granted to an Aboriginal land trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Western Deserts (South) Repeat Land Claim, which is the subject of this amending bill, an agreement was reached relating to some parcels of land not granted in the original claim. After a series of consultations and agreements reached between the parties, the land has been granted. If my understanding of the bill is correct, I think this fundamentally puts that into the schedule. The coalition congratulates those associated with this successful claim&mdash;particularly the central land council&mdash;those traditional owners of the area covered and the Northern Territory government for creating what was a constructive and positive outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the time that we want to devote to this, I will use the opportunity to briefly raise another matter that is associated with this bill; that is, the actions of ATSIC and the Indigenous Land Council which have had an enormous impact on the Northern Territory. I refer to the decisions taken by the Indigenous Land Corporation and ATSIC over the past few weeks. I reiterate to the Senate and remind the Senate that those decisions had two effects. ATSIC made a decision in March ensuring that $20 million of a total of $24 million available for land acquisition under ATSIC's land acquisition and management program would be dedicated to purchasing properties in the Northern Territory for conversion to land rights inalienable freehold title under the act that this bill before us seeks to amend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This upset a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around Australia because it ensured that there would be a massive distortion of funding, under the land acquisition and management program of ATSIC, towards Northern Territory properties capable of being converted to inalienable freehold title. I said in a previous debate in this chamber&mdash;I think it was in the debate when we censured the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for their misleading of the Senate about the ILC legislation&mdash;that not only would this ensure that those people in the southern parts of Australia, and even Western Australia, would be disadvantaged because of that decision, but that they would be disadvantaged for generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While welcoming very much the constructive process that the Central Land Council, the Northern Territory government and the traditional landowners in the Northern Territory have achieved under this bill, you should contrast it with the cynical decision taken by ATSIC and, subsequently, with another decision taken by the ILC just a fortnight or so ago relating to funding for Aboriginal land purchases. While we are very happy&mdash;as I am sure many Aboriginals around Australia will be&mdash;for the traditional owners who will be the beneficiaries of upholding the Western Desert (South) land area in inalienable freehold title, we must think of those Aboriginal people in other parts of Australia who, because of the ATSIC decision to spend $20 million out of $24 million in the next two years solely in the Northern Territory, feel that they have been dispossessed, many of whom will have that dispossession entrenched because of a decision by ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot entirely blame ATSIC because, as documents tabled in this place&mdash;documents that are the subject of a return to order moved by Senator Chamarette&mdash;would show, that the government indeed set out to create a legislative scheme when it created the land fund to ensure that this would happen. Our investigations into the Prime Minister's involvement in what can only be described as a grubby deal relating to the provision of funds for Aboriginal land purchases around Australia will show that this Prime Minister&mdash;if not the minister for Aboriginal affairs, but I do not suspect that he was part of that deal; I think it was Prime Minister&mdash;effectively ensured that all Aboriginals outside the Northern Territory, and I include in that some Aboriginals in the Northern Territory who do not live on traditional lands, will fundamentally have their dispossession, or their access to land at least, further entrenched because of the actions of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, we should recall the fine words and the rhetoric of the Prime Minister during the debate on the native title legislation, and his pronouncements in relation to the land fund. I remind the Senate that at the time of the debate on the so-called Mabo legislation the Prime Minister said that only about five per cent of Aboriginal people would benefit from native title claims. That is not disputed by the coalition or by any experts in that field. But, while that legislation is coming up to its second anniversary, the record to date shows that not one Aboriginal on the mainland has had native title granted yet.

Through the legislative structure that the Prime Minister had a very close hand in establishing, we now find that the 95 per cent of Aboriginals who do not benefit from native title claims are unlikely to derive any benefit for many years to come because the land fund has been established to ensure that the majority of land acquisition funds available to Aboriginal people for at least the next two years will go to the Northern Territory.

The hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and in all other parts of Australia are fundamentally affected not only by the Northern Territory land rights act but also by ATSIC's decision in recent weeks to ensure that $20 million out of $24 million was spent in the Northern Territory and by the ILC's decision to ensure that no money over the next two years is spent in the Northern Territory.

He established with the land fund legislation, which has an important link to this Northern Territory land rights legislation that we are today seeking to amend, that Aboriginals will get more justice. The Prime Minister's legislative package that has gone through the chamber this year under the land fund bill was created with the Prime Minister's own personal involvement to ensure that many Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory would miss out. As I have said&mdash;and I will not say it again after this&mdash;Aboriginal people from Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia who have suffered a lack of access to land for their economic, cultural and religious enjoyment will miss out because of the actions of this Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

For those hundreds of thousands of other Aboriginals who do not have the negotiating power and are not able to access the Prime Minister that justice is illusory. When people look back at this period in Aboriginal affairs they will understand that the Prime Minister's rhetoric&mdash;which is very fine&mdash;is not matched with a delivery of justice for Aboriginal people, particularly when it comes to land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no foundation for those aspersions, Mr President, but let me respond to the substantive question. Resolutions have been successful in the past so far as nuclear tests are concerned. The 1973 resolution, I think it is, to which Senator Alston is referring, involved a plenary UN General Assembly vote&mdash;65 affirmative, seven opposed and 57 abstentions. It was passed, but with a very significant body of abstentions and with a very significant number of countries not actually participating in the vote. By UN standards, the way in which these resolutions are measured in terms of their success, that was regarded as an extremely poor result and one that hardly reflected the sense of passion on the subject of atmospheric testing, which was the case at the time, that was certainly felt in those countries like us that were sponsoring and supporting the resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern, among others, about a resolution in similar terms being moved now is that on the negative side it may well produce, if it did pass, a similar pattern of a high rate of abstentions and a very high rate of non-participation, which would be at spectacular odds with the almost unanimity with which in recent years resolutions in favour of a comprehensive test ban and so on have been passed. That is just a matter for concern and something that does have to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question that has to be taken into account is that the kind of language that would probably be necessary in order to command a majority vote would need to be so soft and so moderate that it would unsatisfactorily represent and unsatisfactorily convey to the international community the nature of the concerns that we really do feel about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just been making the point that these are matters to be taken into account before you blindly embrace that kind of option. Yesterday, very deliberately, I did not rule out the option of a General Assembly resolution or the pursuit of a resolution in any one of a number of other multilateral contexts. In that particular context we are obviously exploring what the art of the possible might be. That will continue to be the case in the period ahead. There is plenty of time in which to contemplate that because the General Assembly does not start until mid-September, the first committee does not start meeting until a week or two after that, and there is an opportunity to well and truly focus on what the options might realistically be. But there is no point in carrying on in this particular fashion and just identifying avenues for possible action unless you are sure that in their impact they will in fact be productive, that they will be effective in conveying the message you want to convey and will not be counter-productive to our larger policy objectives in order to achieve a comprehensive test ban treaty.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question asked by Senator Forshaw does highlight the achievement of the government in reaching agreement on Accord Mark VIII. As Senator Forshaw said in his remarks, Mr Bert Evans from the MTIA has made a number of complimentary remarks about the outcome of the Accord. In an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today Mr Evans claimed credit that the MTIA was involved behind the scenes in discussions and some of the Accord outcomes. That probably explains why the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> is `MTIA breaks ranks on Accord'&mdash;that is, it supports the Accord, unlike some other industry organisations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parties have agreed to ensure the creation of a minimum of 600,000 additional jobs over the life of the Accord for the next 3 1/2 years. As the Accord states, this is essential to the achievement of a five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000-01. To achieve this, the union movement has agreed to assist in the implementation of strategies in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>. For our part, the government will encourage individual unions to seek accreditation so that they can carry out case management for job seekers. We will encourage them to participate directly in labour market programs at both the community and national levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, most importantly, the parties to the Accord have agreed that the five per cent unemployment target is so fundamental to the social and economic well-being of Australia that wage claims will be assessed against satisfactory progress towards this target.

Has the minister's department made an assessment of the relative risks to Australia of a nuclear accident during the proposed French nuclear tests and an accident involving a Chernobyl-type breach of a nuclear power station following a major earthquake in Java?

The agreement does not address, as I have said on many previous occasions, the question of the supply of Australian uranium to Indonesia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a question that is probably out of order because these bills are on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Nonetheless, the question has been asked and has been allowed, so let me give the answer to it. What George Gear referred to, and what I referred to when I gave those figures to the Senate, was the median price of a house and land package which, from recollection, came to about $131,000-plus for Australia. That is the effect on the median house and land package. But we have also given a range of between $300 and $1,000. The reason why we have given that range is that not every house and land package in Australia fits within the median band.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where houses are located, the size of the house one opts for, and the quality of the building materials are all things that go to make a wide range of possibilities for Australian house buyers. The $300 to $1,000 range takes account of that type of diversity in the types of houses that Australians choose. There is nothing here that the government needs to apologise for or correct: rather, the figures that we have given are bolstered by the work that has been done by Treasury in developing appropriate methodology for the calculation of the impact on ordinary Australians of these changes to the tax base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been wild and somewhat dramatic allegations in trying to talk up the impact of this tax. Coming from an opposition that has no economic policy whatsoever it is not surprising that Senator Ian Macdonald would lend his name to this sort of thing. The impact of the GST, for example&mdash;a tax policy that those opposite were promoting before the last election and for which many of them have never surrendered the inspiration&mdash;would have imposed on the average or median size Australian house a tax of $4,000. But those opposite remain unapologetic for that type of approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be made in this debate is the one concerning the absolute and unmitigated hypocrisy of the opposition. What we are talking about here is small changes to the tax base that affect housing prices. But what the opposition is talking about is blocking all of the revenue bills of the government in this session and, therefore, unmaking the federal budget: turning the budget from a budget which is in surplus with a national savings plan to a budget that comes anywhere else between surplus and whatever is the opposition's view. At the same time the opposition is crying crocodile tears at doorstep interviews around this building about the level of the current account deficit and the level of interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is arrant hypocrisy. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot be removing the downward pressure that our budget puts on interest rates and then, if interest rates fail to fall, escape the odium that they as an opposition, by interfering with the budget, have in fact delivered higher costs to Australian house purchasers via interest rates than would ever have been the case with any of these tax changes. If, therefore, interest rates rise, or fail to fall, the cost of extra charges that home buyers in Australia will be paying will be brought to them courtesy of John Howard and Peter Costello and every home buyer in Australia will know that because we will tell them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report to which he referred, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multicultural Australia, the next steps: towards and beyond 2000</EMPHASIS>, is a two-volume report prepared by the National Multicultural Advisory Council, a body that the government established last July to advise on multicultural issues. It is chaired by a former immigration minister, Mick Young; with a deputy chair, former Democrats leader, Janet Powell. The government asked the council, as its first priority, to conduct a thorough review of our national agenda for multicultural Australia; to monitor progress and changes since the agenda was first set down in 1989 to see how it has been implemented; to identify what still needs to be done; and to set down some priorities for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt we have been making a success of multicultural Australia. That does not happen by accident.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those reading the report&mdash;and I know Senator Cooney, with your voracity for reading, you will&mdash;find out how much progress we have made in the last five years and how central our cultural diversity will be to our future development, whether it is economic, social, political or cultural. That is reflected in the breadth of issues examined in detail by the report, ranging from issues such as Australia's national identity, citizenship, racism, access and equity, language, employment and industrial relations, through to sports and the arts. The 47 recommendations made by the council also reflect the breadth of this area. The government will examine them. We look forward to responding to them and launching a new agenda later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting in that context to highlight two issues that have appeared in the council's recommendations to government. One important development focused on by the council is that since 1989 there has been a new focus on a two-way relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. It is important to multicultural Australia. The other development is a new understanding in the business community of productive diversity&mdash;how our multicultural resources and our multicultural work force can be used imaginatively to open doors throughout the world. In fact, in that context there is not one country with which we want to trade that we do not have an understanding within Australia of its culture, language and networks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Senator Short would know that the government displays in the budget the global expectation of income from asset sales. We do not disaggregate the figure by putting against each particular item what we expect to recover for selling that particular asset. We do not do it because, if we were to do so, we would undermine the national interest and we would undermine the interests of Australian taxpayers. If we said what we thought each thing might drag, we would be sure that that would be the maximum price we would get, and no more. Of course, the taxpayers' interest, the ordinary interest of the average Australian, is to see that, where we are disposing of public sector owned properties, we obtain the maximum income for them. So we do not disaggregate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here, in this question, a foray by Senator Short to try to disaggregate the value of each of the component parts of the asset sales line in the budget this year. I will not confirm the accuracy of any of the comments Senator Short has made about that, but I will say that there has been talk about what the expected level of return for Qantas might be. That talk has been grossly inflated. The finance minister has remarked on that himself. The other factor here is that we expect that the budget bottom line will be met, with asset sales carrying the weight that we have given them in the budget settings. So we expect still to meet our budget bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not hypocritical. Those opposite are the hypocrites in this debate, because this question from Senator Short ends with a reference to interest rates. Of course, what is the one weapon that is fighting strongest against interest rates in Australia at the moment? That weapon is the fiscal tightening that this government has been able to bring about in the budget, and that puts downward pressure on interest rates. We have done work in finding savings, some of which you want to cut out and return so that the expenditure lines go up and the savings we have found in outlays, in fact, are returned. You also want to unmake the revenue side of this budget by opposing all of the tax changes in the budget. It is a simple calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget has a tremendous power in the marketplace because it goes into surplus.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You want to undermine that and take the downward pressure that this budget applies to interest rates off. If interest rates do not fall when they ought to because you have unmade the budget, and if interest rates rise when they ought to have stayed still because you have unmade the budget, then the odium for doing that will not rest with the government. We have put our budget down. It is clear. We expect to win the budget bottom line.

It was the only time that any sovereign non-nuclear weapons state has ever allowed atmospheric or other testing to take place on its own soil, with the exception only of Algeria allowing another final run in France.

<PARA>I repeat: the opposition, through its spokesman, argued in the mid-1980s that the specific provisions prohibiting nuclear testing and nuclear waste dumping in the South Pacific should be removed from the treaty. Alexander Downer, now the shadow foreign minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have two objections to the treaty. One is that it is basically an anti-French treaty and little else, and except for the platitudes that we all support, it embarrasses a number of our major allies. Secondly, I think it could be described also as the first stone that has fallen from the edifice which is the Western alliance in our region.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have the present opposition foreign minister, the bathtub boy who is posturing so loudly at the moment, saying that the treaty should be opposed because it was anti-French. This is the bloke who is on record in 1986 saying that this treaty is the best guarantee that we could have or ever would have that this region would be kept nuclear-free and it was opposed by the opposition specifically on the grounds that it was anti-French. The opposition was critical a little later on of our very firmly expressed opposition as a government to the Reagan Administration's Star Wars&mdash;the strategic defense initiative. That was another thing that we were deeply concerned to ensure did not happen because of its dangers of triggering a nuclear holocaust in a way that would be utterly destructive not only of our particular part of the world but of the planet as a whole. </PARA>

On three separate occasions Senator Alston has asked you to rule that out. The reason that you have been asked is that there is a truly massive conflict of interest between your current role as the foreign minister for this great country and your plainly stated and naked ambition to move as fast as you can from this chamber to the UN. In all your international dealings with the French, with the Americans, with the Cubans and with all those other people that you like to constantly associate with, what we are seeing is a man who has a massive conflict of interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate has been most interesting. I note that whilst Senator Cooney invited us all to talk about French nuclear testing, in his five minutes, he did not mention it in any shape or form but, like a lap-dog, ran to the defence of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans. At least I am wearing a blue ribbon to indicate where I stand on the issue of French nuclear testing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans started his remarks by commenting on what happened in the 1950s. That is about as relevant to me&mdash;I was born in 1958&mdash;as talking about what Moses or Adam did. It really has no relevance. Let us remember that it was in the 1950s that Senator Gareth Evans and the Australian Labor Party were still peddling the White Australia policy, a policy that the Liberal Party never embraced in any shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to talk about the policy stances in the 1950s, Senator Evans, go and defend the White Australia policy. You will fail on every occasion if you want to go back to discussing the 1950s. Senator Evans, you invited us to go back to the 1970s. At that time, people of the ilk of Senator Carr were still embracing the human rights record of the Soviet Union. If you want to go back 20 years, do that by all means, but be prepared, Senator Evans and the Australian Labor Party, to acknowledge your great policy failures 40 years ago and 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are debating is not the policy stance of 40 or 20 years ago, but the policy stand today in relation to French nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean. There is no doubt in the mind of any Australian today that the Leader of the Government in this place, as foreign minister, sold Australia's interests very short. There was no way that Senator Evans was prepared at the outset to condemn the French in a way the Australian people would have wanted him to. Senator Cooney, you will note that I am now addressing the question of nuclear testing by the French in the Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the initial stance of Senator Evans? It was like a pussy cat; there was no substance and he was treading softly softly, not knowing which way to go, until he came back to Australia and some people gave him a bit of backbone. Undoubtedly they were not from the Left Wing, which has gone to water recently. It will be interesting to hear Senator Carr's contribution to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Australia wants is a foreign minister who is committed only to the interests of the people of Australia and to world peace. We do not want a foreign affairs minister who has on top of his agenda the desire to become the UN Secretary-General. After having failed so dismally to get himself onto the High Court and after having missed out on becoming Deputy Prime Minister, because Kim Beazley has beaten him to that&mdash;he is no longer heir apparent&mdash;it will be third time lucky, he hopes. He will now try for the job of UN Secretary-General. </PARA>

Quite frankly, I doubt it and I think the world would have a lot better people on offer to undertake that task. Having said that, our concern is that he is selling Australia short in his personal ambition to pursue the UN secretary-generalship. That is the important point in this debate. It is not whether Senator Evans has the qualifications and all the other things that Senator Cooney went on with.

I can see the claim being made by the other side about an inference or an imputation on a motive, but the necessary consequence of accepting that point of order is that this side of the chamber cannot raise the question of whether the minister is putting some other personal priority over and above his priorities as a minister. That is a very serious question. That is why we have been pursuing it. The minister has had the opportunity to rule out that he is interested in taking this job. He has declined to do that. While that state of affairs remains, it must be a question in the minds of the Australian community whether there is a conflict of interest. If that rule can be used to stop an opposition raising the question of a minister's conflict of interest, how on earth is the parliament meant to pursue whether a minister is putting some other personal issue over and above his or her ministerial duties?

It is a most shocking allegation which would need a lot of evidence before it was made.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, these Regulations make amendments relating to the information to be included in evidentiary certificates where the Commissioner of Taxation is taking action against a person for the recovery of sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the two sets of rules make an almost identical amendment to the respective principal regulations, the following comments apply equally to both instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement for the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations (Amendment) states that the regulation in force prior to the making of the current amendment, regulation 18, "requires the Commissioner to certify [in the evidentiary certificate] that an assessment of sales tax payable by a person was made against the person in respect of the year set out in the certificate". This amending instrument, which removes the reference to a particular year from the Commissioner's certificate of assessment, is made retrospective to 16 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has considered the explanation for the amendment in the Explanatory Statement, being that as the Act does not refer to a year, the amendment is removing an inconsistency from regulation 18. It is not unusual, however, for regulations to set out the details, manner and time frames within which fees, levies and charges or other imposts are to be collected or other matters complied with. That is, the delegated legislation sets out the details after the head legislation has set out the general principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to be satisfied that regulation 18 is not, in fact, valid law, the Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to the need to amend regulation 18 and as to whether any evidentiary certificates issued during 16 June 1994 to present were used in any actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances Statement on work of Committee during Autumn and Winter Sittings 1995</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings, the Committee scrutinised the highest volume of delegated legislation ever recorded for a sitting period in the history of the Committee. The Committee scrutinises all disallowable legislative instruments tabled in the Senate, to ensure compliance with non-partisan principles of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. Of credit to the Committee, the Committee's secretariat and its legal adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan AM, the scrutiny process has maintained high standards notwithstanding the increased workload.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high volume of legislation reflects a growth in the number of government programs, the broad policy of which is set out in principal Acts. The delegated legislation authorised by the Acts generally contains the administrative details of these programs. It is the Committee's task to scrutinise the subordinate legislation against certain criteria which have been summarised into four general principles set out in Senate Standing Order 23. These are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)that it is in accordance with the statute;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)that it does not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)that it does not unduly make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to review of their merits by a judicial or other independent tribunal and;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)that it does not contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that the Committee finds that any of these principles may have been breached, the Committee's usual procedure is to forward a letter to the relevant Minister or law maker, requesting that the concerns raised by the Committee be examined. A response which satisfies the Committee may be an explanation which dispels the Committee's concerns, or confirmation that there exists a defect requiring remedial action, together with an assurance that such action will be taken. The Committee frequently receives an undertaking that appropriate amendments will be made to the offending legislation. If, however, a satisfactory response is not received and the Committee, in all the circumstances, is of the opinion that the situation warrants it, notice of motion of disallowance is given by the Chairman in respect of the subject instrument. A disallowance motion is the ultimate and last resort sanction of the Committee in respect of legislation which fails, or appears to fail the scrutiny process. The actual disallowance of legislation, however, is a rare occurrence. In fact, subordinate legislation has not been disallowed since 1988 due to action taken by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that such disallowance of legislation is a rare occurrence is testimony to the cooperation which the Committee receives from Ministers and Government Departments and Agencies. The action taken by the Committee and the response to that action by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in relation to Income Tax Regulations, Statutory Rules 1994 No.461 detailed below under principle (c), exemplifies the cooperative effort between the Committee and relevant Government representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is always appreciative of responsive and responsible action which serves to avoid the unnecessary disallowance of legislation. It is, of course, in the interests of all parties, that legislation is of the highest possible standard. The non partisan approach adopted by the Committee underpins the ability of the Committee to achieve that objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee scrutinised 1,330 instruments. This represents an increase of 75.7 per cent on the last sittings. Of these 123 were statutory rules, the drafting of which is generally considered to be of a superior standard than that of other kinds of subordinate legislation. The remaining balance of instruments, being 1,207, were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series. Each of the 1,330 instruments was scrutinised by the Committee against the criteria summarised in the four principles mentioned above. There were 145 prima facie defects or matters worthy of comment in those instruments. The matters raised by the Committee with the relevant Ministers and law makers are described below under each of the four principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A disproportionately high number of concerns are raised by the Committee under this principle. This reflects the broad interpretation which the Committee places upon this principle. It covers not only technical invalidity, but also every other aspect of parliamentary propriety. There were one hundred and three matters raised under this principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegated legislation must be legally valid and must comply with its parent Act and with other Acts such as the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 limits the type of material "as in force from time to time" which may be incorporated in legislative instruments. One instrument defined an expression by reference to `the national classification of TAFE courses'. The question was raised whether the instrument referred to that classification system as it existed at a particular time, or whether it was intended to cover the classifications in the forms in which they may exist from time to time. The Minister advised that the classification system is the "national classification of TAFE courses" which is of a fixed nature. The Committee was satisfied that the incorporation did not impinge upon section 49A. Another instrument provided for the means of calculating the increase in the national employer benefit in any year by referring to Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases published by the Statistician. In that case the consensus of legal opinion was that the incorporation was valid, notwithstanding that it referred to more than one figure, because the figures do not link as an instrument or other writing as in force from time to time. On another occasion, however, the Committee detected a breach of section 49A which was confirmed by the relevant Minister. An Airworthiness Directive required compliance with a specific document and subsequent temporary revisions. This purported incorporation was in breach of section 49A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question regarding the validity of an incorporation of documents was also raised in respect of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Regulations which incorporated many documents by reference. In such a scientific field, the incorporation is probably desirable. Nonetheless, the Committee examined the incorporation to ensure that it is in accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation. The Committee has also inquired as to whether the standards made by the Australian Accounting Standards Board are instruments of a kind which may be incorporated under s49A, as they exist from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On two occasions, the Committee's processes revealed that instruments which were the subject of an amending instrument, had not been tabled. This was due to the unorthodox tabling provisions which exist under the principal Act. The Minister had, however, previously undertaken to review these tabling provisions. Another instrument purported to revoke the former instrument in the same series. A search of available records indicated that the former instrument had not been received for scrutiny and that, although it was notified in the Gazette, it appeared not to have been tabled in either House of Parliament. The Committee has raised appropriate questions with respect to that instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a clearly established principle that the drafting of delegated legislation should be of a standard equal to that of Acts. During the present sittings there were many errors in relation to numbering and citation. Two instruments had no numbering. Three instruments had no numbering and no other means of citation. One instrument had two different systems of numbering. The renumbering of another instrument contained errors. Other instruments contained errors in the numbering used throughout the document and in referring to provisions in other instruments. Where the renumbering of an instrument had occurred due to previous errors and renumbering is contained in a separate amending instrument, the Committee explored the possibility of the instrument being reprinted as it deals with the rights of the aged and infirm. Yet another instrument had an irrelevant attachment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some instruments were found to contain typographical errors of a minor nature and others contained imprecise or objectionable language. One instrument, for example, referred to "Parliamentary Council" when clearly "Parliamentary Counsel" was intended. Yet another incorrectly spelt the name of a disease. The Committee noted the extensive use of sexist language in a Treaty set out in a schedule to Regulations. Whilst recognising that removal of such language from the Treaty would be outside the practical capabilities of the Committee, it acknowledged the unacceptability of such language in either Commonwealth Acts or subordinate legislation. Several instruments contained imprecise definitions or lacked definitions where definitions were required. Some defined terms or phrases not even used in the instrument. Similarly some instruments defined expressions which were not even used, but which were similar to other expressions which were in the instrument. In addition some instruments contained vague or peculiar expressions. For example, AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No.409, provided that amongst the changes to a person's circumstances about which the department must be notified is if a person "gets a spouse".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every instrument should be accompanied by full and detailed explanatory material. One instrument had no Explanatory Statement. Others had Explanatory Statements which did not contain sufficient explanatory material, or which contained ambiguous material. Several Explanatory Statements contained errors of a minor nature, such as typographical errors and incorrect dates. One Explanatory Statement was inconsistent with the instrument. The Explanatory Statement referred to three named institutions, whereas the instrument itself referred to two different institutions. A number of instruments fulfilled or partially fulfilled previous undertakings given to the Committee to amend errors which the Committee had identified. Many of these, however, were accompanied by Explanatory Statements which did not mention the role of the Committee in identifying the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that delegated legislation which operates to prejudice a person retrospectively is void. Even where retrospectivity is valid, the Committee will raise a query, particularly where long periods of retrospectivity are involved. During the present sittings, the Committee raised concerns about retrospectivity on seventeen occasions. The issue of possible prejudicial retrospectivity was raised in relation to several instruments from a single authority. Retrospectivity was frequently raised in the context of compliance dates, where certain inspections were required to have taken place by dates which had already passed. The Committee's concern was that such compliance, if it had not already occurred, was now impossible. In other instruments in the same series, some compliance dates appeared remote when considered in the context of the danger the instrument sought to avert. On one occasion, the non-existent compliance date of 31 June 1995 was given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some instruments are intended to operate retrospectively but without prejudicially affecting any individual other than the Commonwealth. Where the Explanatory Statement does not give an appropriate assurance in relation to retrospectivity, the Committee has sought confirmation that this is so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some technical errors which appear to be minor at first glance may, in fact, have substantial ramifications. The Committee raised concerns about apparent discrepancies in two instruments which adjusted the Higher Education Contribution Scheme liabilities of institutions for certain years. Discrepancies were detected between the institutions named in the instrument and those institutions named in the Principle Act under which the payments are authorised. In several cases, the discrepancies were minor. Others, however, were more significant. The Committee is advised, in respect of one of those instruments, that an appropriate declaration was made changing the name of the institution. The Committee was satisfied with this response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns were raised on the grounds that some instruments may be technically invalid. Four instruments in a particular series appeared to have been made outside the period provided by the enabling provisions under which they were made. The Minister undertook to introduce amending legislation to ensure the validity of the instruments and any decisions made thereunder. In addition, one of those instruments was undated and extraneous material was provided to verify the date the instrument was signed. Two of these instruments also lacked gazettal dates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In ensuring that subordinate legislation conforms with all aspects of parliamentary propriety, the Committee raised three other matters worthy of specific comment. One instrument provided the procedures to be followed to ensure that persons affected by reviewable decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are made aware of their rights to seek review of those decisions on the merits. The instrument, however, did not appear to stipulate how the "public notice" is to be given. The Committee was sufficiently concerned to make appropriate inquiries. Second, another instrument proposed to make an amendment which appeared to remove certain instruments from parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee always views such initiatives with concern and made appropriate inquiries to determine precisely which instruments, if any, would be affected by the proposed regulation. The Committee was satisfied by the response received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, another instrument declared that insect repellent for use on human beings was to be regarded as "an agricultural chemical product". This provision raised the question of whether it went beyond the limits of the Act requiring such products to be subjected to all the testing and modification procedures required by the Agricultural Chemical Products code. The Committee's inquiries were satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (b)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liabilities?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle broadly, to include every aspect of personal rights. The Committee views with concern legislation which contains unreasonable provisions or provisions which appear to impose harsh and unfair penalties. Furthermore, procedures provided for in subordinate legislation should be fair and accompanied by appropriate safeguards. In addition to those matters, the Committee will also query unusual or unexpected provisions. During the present sittings the Committee raised the following matters in relation to delegated legislation under this heading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee examined two instruments which it considered contained material appropriate for consideration by the Privacy Commissioner. The first instrument authorised the release of certain types of information and in the circumstances, the Committee felt it appropriate that the Privacy Commission should have been consulted in the process of development of the instrument. The second instrument involves the release of personal information. Although the Explanatory Statement noted that the disclosure of personal information is aligned with parts of Privacy Principle 11 in the Privacy Act 1991, the Committee considered that it was appropriate to ask whether the Privacy Commissioner had been consulted. These matters have been raised with the relevant Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another instrument proposes to impose strict liability in circumstances in which it may be unreasonable to do so. The Committee has written to the relevant Minister drawing attention to those provisions and pointing out the possible unfair consequences for some defendants. The Committee has inquired as to whether the imposition of strict liability in circumstances which may have an unfair result may be avoided. In relation to other instruments, the Committee has sought confirmation that the rights of persons have not been disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (c)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is common for subordinate legislation to contain provisions which confer discretions on Ministers or other public officials. Some of the discretions conferred may be significant. The Committee supports the conferring of narrow discretions which are exercised against well defined and objective criteria. The Committee believes that decisions made in the exercise of such discretions should be subject to a review on the merits by an external and independent tribunal. This is normally satisfied by the provision for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Sometimes there are additional opportunities for review by other independent bodies and the Committee welcomes such opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee raised concerns about the provision of review procedures on thirteen occasions. Concerns were raised in relation to, for example, the importation of certain firearms and part of firearms, and the allocation of capacity under the International Air Services Commission Regulations (Amendment). Such decisions may have considerable commercial implications for affected parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another instrument involved the procedures to be followed at the Annual General Meetings of a particular organisation. The procedures enabled the organisation itself to determine the status of individuals which affected voting rights. Although decisions affecting status would be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Committee was concerned to inquire as to whether the review process would be completed prior to the Annual General Meeting. The Committee also questioned the status of resolutions passed at an Annual General Meeting from which potential voters had been wrongly excluded. The concerns of the Committee were allayed by the response which fully described the relevant procedures and related matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One instrument conferred a discretion on the Secretary of the relevant Department to enable the holder of a visa to be employed in Australia by any employer for a period in excess of three months. The response explained the discretion in the context of a previous amendment which had erroneously omitted the discretion. The Committees was satisfied with the explanation. Another instrument conferred a discretion on a Minister which would be exercised in respect of the operator of one enterprise only. The Committee has made relevant inquiries regarding the review procedures available in relation to the exercise of that discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Income Tax Regulations, Statutory Rules No.461 of 1994</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following illustrates the application of the third principle to the Income Tax Regulations.These amending regulations, amongst other things, outline the method for calculating transitional lump sum reasonable benefit limits (RBLs) and transitional pension RBLs as proposed in section 140ZE of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Some of the regulations confer very wide discretions on the Commissioner, particularly those contained in regulations 51 and 53E. Regulation 51 provides that the Commissioner may determine RBLs at a higher rate than otherwise provided by the regulations "because of special circumstances". Under regulation 53E, the Commissioner may permit registration of a transitional RBL at a date later than the cut-off date of 31 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, inquiring as to whether decisions made by the Commissioner in exercise of the discretion were subject to independent review. To preserve the Committee's options, notice of motion of disallowance was given on 21 March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The response to the Committee's letter indicated that the only review available was that under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The Committee considered this response against its third term of reference which requires the Committee to ensure that delegated legislation does not unduly make citizens rights dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to review of their merits by a judicial or other independent tribunal. Against this criteria the Committee concluded that it was unsatisfactory that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 should be the only avenue for review. The Committee therefore wrote again in more specific terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As notice of motion of disallowance was due to expire an appropriate course of action had to be determined. It was clear that there were competing interests in this matter. On the one hand, the nature of the discretions in the regulations demanded an additional and independent opportunity for review on the merits. On the other hand, disallowance could result in the loss of the only flexibility available in the system for calculating RBLs. This could have meant a very negative result for taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A draft response to the Committee's second letter was received. That letter confirmed the Committee's conclusions regarding the lack of opportunity for review of decisions on their merits. Hoping to avoid the invalidation of the regulations, and thereby preserve some flexibility in the system for the taxpayer, the Chair on behalf of the Committee, again wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary. The Chair indicated that an undertaking by the Parliamentary secretary to provide the requisite review mechanism would be an appropriate response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliamentary Secretary provided that undertaking on the same day. From the point of view of the Committee, this was a most satisfactory resolution. This case illustrates the co-operative effort of the Committee and relevant Government representatives to avoid the unnecessary disallowance of legislation whilst ensuring that subordinate legislation conforms with parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (d)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for Parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Matters are not often raised under this principle. It is, nevertheless, an important principle.

The foreign country insists that it is not using our poppy juice to make its heroin and is prepared to enter into a bilateral agreement that none of our poppy juice will be so used. Would we continue to supply such a country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much more serious is it when it is not heroin and a few dead addicts but a threat to the security of the whole of human kind? For not only is there an immediate and local threat from the Mururoa tests but a much greater threat through the reversal of the trend toward a cessation of nuclear testing and thence to total nuclear disarmament. The hard work of very many people in this direction has been undermined by the arrogance of the French president. The cause of peace and cooperation has been placed once more in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would the French want to continue testing if they do not reserve the right to use these weapons in either an aggressive or defensive way. However they are used, nuclear weapons are destructive. Their use would damage the user as much as those against whom they are used. There is no place on our shrinking globe for the use of nuclear bombs. The Foreign Minister drew attention to that matter only a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA>The long-term consequences from certain types of atomic bomb explosions could be total sterilisation of vast areas of the earth for generations. No encouragement of any kind should be given to any nation that tests nuclear weapons and, by implication, entertains their possible use. On the contrary, every effort must be made to dissuade that nation from its dangerous course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the resumption of the French tests there is probably more unanimity of the Australian people behind a ban on uranium exports to France than any other matter at this time. The passing of this bill would be extremely popular. This bill gives effect to the wish of the majority of the Australian people. It gives legislative expression to the democratic voice of the people. This contrasts strongly with the French decision which appears to have been taken by the president alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of the Labor Party is designed to restrict uranium exports to nations that are acting against the interests of nuclear non-proliferation. In 1984, when France was still testing, the Labor Party adopted a policy which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reserves the right . . . to withhold supplies of uranium permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period from any country which . . . adopts nuclear practices or policies inimical to further advance in the cause of nuclear non-proliferation.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite a weakening in nuclear policy in 1994, the Labor Party's policy still included the same clause but in the meantime France had ceased testing. A clause follows the 1984 clause which acknowledges the cessation and the moratorium which France had then placed on nuclear tests, but goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Australia shall not permit further contracts of Australian uranium to France until France enters into a comprehensive test ban treaty.</PARA>
<PARA>In this the ALP seems to be giving a higher priority to maintaining existing contracts than to nuclear non-proliferation. However, it indicates a sensitivity on the part of the party with respect to France&mdash;a sensitivity which is more keenly felt by the Left and conscience of the party. It also indicates a very real concern for the danger of continued testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the Labor Party, the coalition has never opposed the export of uranium. It was the coalition, when in government, that approved the first exports of uranium for civil use. It was also a coalition government that exported uranium to Britain for the manufacture of the bombs that were exploded at Maralinga. This bill gives the coalition an opportunity to demonstrate to the Australian people that it now places a higher priority on long-term human welfare and nuclear non-proliferation followed by total nuclear disarmament than on getting its 30 pieces of grubby silver from a nation that ignores these paramount considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people want their parliament to take strong action in the face of French defiance of international condemnation. This bill provides the opportunity for the whole parliament to unanimously support a measure which will place Australia in the forefront of peace seeking nations and earn the gratitude of every Australian citizen and every citizen of the many South Pacific nations that lie closer to the tests&mdash;not a few of whose citizens have suffered directly from cancers induced by the radiation from earlier bomb tests. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this bill to every member of the Senate and seek their unequivocal support. I point out that when the government moves the adjournment, the Democrats will seek a division as an expression of the fact that the government and the opposition are simply not wishing to proceed with this important piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>We do not have a great deal of time this afternoon. It was with great difficulty that this Senate committee proceeded with its inquiry into soccer, not least because we followed an inquiry which had been carried out by former Mr Justice Stewart under considerable difficulties. Mr Stewart was asked to inquire into various aspects of soccer, particularly the transfer of Australian players to overseas clubs by the Australian Soccer Federation. In the course of that inquiry, he was not acting in a judicial capacity. Therefore, he did not have the ability to subpoena witnesses or offer witness protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Stewart report was eventually presented to the Australian Soccer Federation, it contained a number of recommendations. Many of those recommendations named particular people in highly adverse ways. The Australian Soccer Federation was placed in a situation whereby, with legal advice, had it published that report it may have been subject to legal action for publishing defamatory comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee understands that all but one member of the board of the federation received a copy of the report, and some parts of that report certainly were available to the media. Stories regarding what Mr Justice Stewart had said had begun to circulate. It was in that context that the Senate committee first took up this reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that circumstance, at the time of taking up the reference unanimously the committee felt that it was appropriate for the Stewart report to be published so that all those matters would be out in the open and under parliamentary privilege; that this would protect the Australian Soccer Federation; and that all those who were adversely named could come forward and provide evidence under parliamentary privilege to the committee. If they chose, they could provide contrary evidence. That is the context in which the committee conducted its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was able to look at a number of the matters which Mr Justice Stewart had inquired into. In the course of our inquiries we have come to conclusions, in many cases different from those of Mr Justice Stewart. In that regard we would emphasise most strongly that the Senate inquiry has played an extremely valuable role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the committee's hearings, the Soccer Federation board itself underwent considerable reconstruction. A number of members of the board left and new members were appointed. The chairman of the board changed. Mr David Hill, former chairman of the ABC, came in as chairman of the board of the Australian Soccer Federation. A number of changes had already begun to be made while our committee was deliberating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make some comment on the summary of the principal findings of the committee, because I think it is worth emphasising just what this committee did achieve. We confirmed the media reports which, for several years before the committee took this reference, had generated considerable public concerns about the very, very large sums of money being paid by overseas clubs for Australian players. Many of those sums of money were not fully accounted for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were stories of cash transactions and large amounts of money going missing. We were able to confirm that indeed large amounts of money had gone missing and, while we were not able to find exactly where the money had gone, nonetheless there were gross discrepancies, very serious discrepancies. We believe that highlighting those differences will help to support our other recommendations which go to the heart of improving the whole transfer process and making it a great deal more transparent. We identified that cash payments had been made, and, as I say, while we were not able to identify the ultimate beneficiaries of these vast differences, nonetheless there is a clear and very important need to clean up this whole process of transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impression that came most strongly to me was one of a rapid improvement and increasing number in the quality of Australian soccer players which resulted in an increase in demand for those players by overseas clubs, principally European clubs, and also a very substantial increase in the price being paid for those players. In that situation, it seems that soccer administration generally in Australia failed to put in place proper mechanisms to ensure that Australian soccer, the Australian clubs and the Australian players got the very best deal from those transactions and, in that process, exposed certain officials to the possibility of acting improperly and certainly exposed Australia to the possibility that these large sums of money which we identified went missing and went to sources at this stage unknown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not find that the two principals at the centre of the coach transfer were in any way guilty of receiving any of this money. While we found it strange that they had not been asked to sign formal contracts and that at least the principal coach, Mr Eddie Thomson, had acted in a way which was improper, I certainly would accept that he was put in that position by the failure of the Australian Soccer Federation to put other mechanisms in place which would have substituted for the actions which he took in relation to player transfers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the government members of this committee have sought to place on record a minority report, I would also like to reiterate that with the change in the government membership on the committee I believe the committee did become hampered by the attitude of some of those government members. I also believe the committee was exposed to ridicule on several occasions when government members chose to expose the differences in relation to whether the committee should have been taking certain evidence and what sort of evidence it should have been taking&mdash;indeed, even whether the committee should have existed in the first place. Those discussions which should, I believe, have been kept within the confines of the committee in private session were exposed to public view. I would certainly dissociate myself and the majority of the members of the committee from those actions. I think they were unnecessarily damaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe there has been a significant improvement in the administration of soccer. Part of that has been brought about because the committee was able to release the Stewart report and, of course, by the processes through which the committee went. The evidence which was brought forward to the committee itself accelerated and catalysed that process of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soccer is an extremely good game. It should be a game in greater prominence in Australia. I believe it has been hampered in the past by these stories of corruption, mismanagement and lack of proper administration. I believe that the work of this committee has helped to put soccer on a much sounder footing with a better administration and that from here it will go forward to be the sort of game that it should be and to attract the sort of support that it should have been attracting in recent years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this report on soccer and to perhaps explain my role in these matters. I came late to this committee; in fact I replaced Senator Devereux. As a consequence of becoming the chair of the legislative side of the committee I became the deputy chair of this reference of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the committee's references was this soccer inquiry. Like many people in this place, I had heard that this was not necessarily the most savoury of activities but I was prepared to approach the matter with an open mind and I read through the evidence that had been presented to my office. Upon reading that, it became very clear to me that there was a major problem in using the Senate for this type of work. I do not particularly want to engage in a polemic about the detail of it, but I want to place on record my very firm belief that the Senate should not be used to attack the civil liberties of Australian citizens as I think it is a fundamental principle of good government and the good legislative processes of this country. To me this inquiry quite clearly and demonstrably is an occasion when the civil liberties of Australian citizens have been fundamentally abused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get the context right. Last year there was a series of allegations about improprieties within the Soccer Federation. As a consequence, it obviously had some serious debates within its ranks. The ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program made a whole range of most serious allegations about the activities of a number of people involved in the Australian Soccer Federation, coaches, players, agents, clubs and officials. As I understand the situation, at that point a proposal was advanced by certain Liberal members of parliament that there be a Senate inquiry into these allegations. It was felt that the Soccer Federation should be able to sort these things out. It commissioned Mr Justice Stewart to produce a report, which cost something like $450,000. In that report a whole series of quite strong and quite serious allegations were made about the activities of certain citizens of this country. As a result of this inquiry by the committee which the Senate set up, the Senate has found that most of the matters of concern to the committee had been resolved by the Soccer Federation by the time the Senate report was actually handed down today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of the Stewart report being produced, very serious defamatory remarks were made. As a consequence, there had to be an outlet, under parliamentary privilege, to prevent defamation action being taken in the courts by citizens who were offended by these remarks. We have provided a vehicle by which defamatory remarks can be made and citizens' rights through the courts can be denied by using the Senate process to allow those remarks to become after-the-fact evidence before a committee of the Senate. People can be subpoenaed. As a consequence, there can be no protection at law for the people offended by those remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very serious allegations that went to corruption, conflict of interests, tax avoidance, improper financial transactions and a whole range of other matters were made. Criminal matters were alleged which have never been proved. Quite clearly, this report does not prove them but has left a slur on those persons' names throughout the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what honourable senators opposite say and no matter what Mr Justice Stewart said in his report&mdash;he said his findings were opinions&mdash;no-one is able to convincingly demonstrate that most people believe the Stewart findings were nothing more than someone's opinion. That is the real problem in this matter. We have made a series of very serious allegations which have been given the cloak of legitimacy of the Senate. We say to people who are called&mdash;and subpoenaed in some cases&mdash;before this committee, `Aren't you glad you had the right to respond to these allegations that this Senate, through its committee, has given legitimacy to?' I put on the record that I am deeply offended by that process of the abuse by this chamber of civil liberties of citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence adduced to the committee at no point demonstrated that any of those allegations had any substance. The police inquiries were rightly undertaken, as they should be when allegations like these are made. What did the police come up with? No recourse to criminal prosecutions because the evidence does not warrant that. That is in writing. Does that help the people who have lost their livelihoods or whose lives have been destroyed or in any way dramatically affected by these allegations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Clerk of the Senate raised very serious concerns about the operations of these committees. He makes the point that actions before Senate inquiries and before the Senate cannot be used in courts of law. Therefore it would be possible for those who have committed offences to use that defence in a court of law. By the same token, those who are slurred or defamed cannot seek redress because it is all done under parliamentary privilege. You have a situation where the guilty are able to be protected and the innocent are slurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a process that I want to be associated with. Senator Coulter makes the point that this committee may not have worked effectively because the Labor members did not fully cooperate with it. Nor should we! Nor should we be part of such an outrageous attack on civil liberties. I make it my business not to go along with that blatant abuse of the rights of the citizens of this country by this chamber. It is a gross waste of public money. It is a gross indecency, in terms of the political rights of citizens of this country, to be part of it. </PARA>

I am not trained as a defence lawyer or a police prosecutor. Under our constitutional arrangements, I do not have the right to act as if I were a judge. You are deluding yourselves if you think that is an appropriate function for this Senate. All too often Senate inquiries have developed into witch-hunts and kangaroo courts.

Since David Hill's appointment to the federation you can see a symbolisation and major changes in the soccer world.

Other matters are before various courts such as the arbitration courts. </PARA>

The Labor senators made clear throughout the work of this committee that we were seeking to have these matters brought to a conclusion much earlier than they were. Every attempt was made by the majority to resist it. While I am sure honourable senators opposite appreciate the great value of the game of soccer and have a deep personal interest in the game of soccer, I found extraordinary the personal efforts they made to secure evidence, which would not have come before the committee in the normal course of events, to bolster the claims they had been making and the attacks on civil liberties they had been making to try to drum up some basis for their claims. They have failed dismally. This report demonstrates their failure.</PARA>

One of them, I believe, was to protect a mate of one of his mates&mdash;Mr Labbozetta, a friend and appointee of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) on the Immigration Review Tribunal&mdash;despite the fact that Senator Carr failed to take any active role in this committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that soccer football in Australia receives $1 1/2 million a year in taxpayers' money. The people who are spending that money are people who had been subjected to that kind of very public criticism, not just in the Stewart inquiry but in other public arenas. For example, Mr Hill himself, who kept on complaining about the existence of the inquiry when it suited him, failed to mention that he was the head of the organisation, the ABC, that brought this problem to the forefront of public attention in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. We have given the people who were attacked in that program the opportunity to clear their names, and I believe their names have been cleared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were assiduous in trying to make certain that soccer had every opportunity to emerge from this with a clean sheet. I note that we were blamed and attacked by Senator Carr for having done what we could to make certain that all evidence that could come forward did come forward. In other words, by doing our job we obviously infuriated Senator Carr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are very simple. This matter could have been resolved a long time ago. In mid-1993 we discovered in evidence that the Chief Executive of the Australian Soccer Federation wrote to the English Football Association&mdash;this is more than two years ago&mdash;saying that it was going to have an inquiry into these problems it was having with agents. At that stage, the English Football Association had discovered a whole range of problems, particularly relating to transfers of Australian players to British clubs. There was a massive difference between the price being paid by the clubs and the price the Australian clubs were getting for their players. Here was the Australian taxpayer putting $1 1/2 million a year into soccer, while foreign agents were siphoning off&mdash;and that is just in the transfers we looked at&mdash;something like $1.2 million. </PARA>

We have established quite clearly the amounts in various transfers. We have not, unfortunately, been able to do as well as we might, because a lot of people made allegations behind the hand. There were a number of people, particularly players, who, as I understand it, talked to the media&mdash;that is, if the media people are telling the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those claims and allegations simply were not made to this committee when people had the opportunity to do so&mdash;apart from one or two players who came and gave some very frank and, I might say, risky evidence in the sense that they may well have risked their playing future in this way. We commend them for doing so. But, on the whole, it does seem that many players had very strong reasons for not doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the reason they failed to come forward was not because they were participating in some way in the tax free amounts of money that appear to have disappeared, if you like&mdash;maybe they were switched to who knows where under these arrangements. We saw a clear situation where there were receipts issued by an Australian soccer club for $515,000 for a transfer and, in fact, that club itself received only $240,000. Certainly, some of the gap was made up by specific cash payments<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">and we have been able to see that. But we still do not know what happened to the great bulk&mdash;a difference of almost $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some pretty good ideas and we have been led in certain directions, but the simple fact is that this committee's inquiries could establish without doubt that Australian soccer has been milked for a particular purpose by some foreign clubs. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a slush fund, or maybe several slush funds, created overseas from money brought to Australia, purportedly for the purpose of a transfer but which, in fact, has been diverted for other purposes&mdash;presumably to create a tax free slush fund in another country, possibly Switzerland&mdash;so that tax free payments can be made to players or others for particular purposes in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that the committee's inquiry has served the best interests of both soccer football&mdash;in providing an opportunity to clear the air of all of the allegations, the rumours and the speculation affecting the sport over a considerable period&mdash;as well as allowing those alleged to have been guilty of misbehaviour the opportunity to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that one of my colleagues wishes to say a few words, but I do just want to say this. We have discovered quite a few additional matters that Senator Carr did not have the decency to acknowledge. We have found, as a result of the inquiries in Britain, that certain material which we have deliberately not brought before the committee, and which has been referred to authorities to pursue, may well be of a criminal nature. I want to stress this: at no stage did this committee transgress into the area of criminality; at no stage did we seek to act as judge or jury. We were looking at people's behaviour and the proprietary of it, not the illegality of it. That is why Senator Carr's attack on this committee is a disgrace. It is a political stunt.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland Government has recently corporatised QIDC and as part of this exercise is seeking to enhance the accountability of QIDC by enabling it to be brought under Reserve Bank supervision. This Bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to bring QIDC under Reserve Bank prudential supervision. To this end, the Queensland Government has recently referred its banking powers, with respect to QIDC, to the Commonwealth. Specifically, this Bill includes QIDC within the definition of a bank in section 5 of the Banking Act 1959, thereby establishing a legislative basis for Reserve Bank supervision of QIDC. This will ensure that QIDC follows Reserve Bank requirements and is subject to the supervision of the Reserve Bank in relation to prudential matters.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new procedures, if adopted, will act to severely weaken the Commonwealth environmental impact assessment process. They will reduce&mdash;and I stress this&mdash;uniformity and certainty for both environmental groups and industry, reducing the overall effectiveness and integrity of Commonwealth environmental assessment to a lower standard than is found at present. The new procedures increase ministerial discretion, thereby allowing further discrimination within industry due to the triggering of the EIA process being potentially reliant on the political climate surrounding a proposed project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Projects of a very similar nature may not be subject to the same costs and delays due to the high level of discretion involved. The new procedures decrease the integrity of the process for both industry and environmentalists by leaving many important decisions with ministers lacking expertise in this area&mdash;that is, lacking the expertise in the environmental area. The action minister can be just about any minister who has the initial responsibility for a particular proposal, and not the minister for the environment, who actually has the trained people who can make the assessments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes are in conflict with the public review of the Commonwealth EIA process&mdash;CEPA, 1994&mdash;which was initiated in October 1993 and has sought extensive industry and environmental input. The new procedures do not take up the federal government's responsibilities towards national environmental protection or uniform encouragement of industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> New paragraph 1.2.1 states that the action minister must designate a proponent for an environmentally significant action or an action for which it is desirable to designate a proponent for other reasons, except as otherwise provided by these procedures. Part (b) of this paragraph increases the discretion of the action minister and, hence, certainty and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress most strongly to the opposition that this procedure which we are debating this afternoon, if allowed, increases the uncertainty and decreases the accountability and for that reason, we believe the opposition should be minded to support it. It does this by allowing him or her to introduce a development to the EIA process for purely political reasons. Similar projects may not be subject to similar environmental controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 1.2.2 goes on to severely weaken paragraph 1.2.1 by stating that paragraph 1.2.1, except if initiated under 1.2.1 (b), will not operate if the action minister considers that any relevant environmental effect has been fully taken into account in giving effect to the procedures in relation to an earlier action, or a proponent has been designated in relation to another action in relation to which these procedures have been complied with, and the action minister considers that any relevant effect of the latter action, firstly, is an extension of the environmental effect of the latter action, secondly, is not of a nature significantly different from that of the effect of the earlier proposed action and, thirdly, does not significantly add to the effect of the earlier proposed action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in this speech I will give examples of how grossly those provisions have been ignored in recent decisions. It also ensures that if any earlier proposed action had been permitted to be taken or commenced before the procedures are complied with, this fact will be fully taken into account in giving effect to these procedures. I will give examples of the gross misuse of that provision also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If adopted, this section will operate to decrease the integrity of the process by reducing the professionalism and objectivity of decision making by leaving many important decisions with the minister responsible for the promotion of the development. The minister for resources has a responsibility to promote the use of resources; the minister for the environment has a responsibility to look after the environment. In this case we are talking about environmental protection legislation, which clearly should come under the minister for the environment, not the minister for resources. It puts the minister into a conflict of interest situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section severely restricts what proposed actions may constitute an initiative for which a proponent may be designated and reduces the environmental expertise involved in decision making by leaving such decisions with the action minister. Again, I emphasise that the action minister is not the minister who has the staff, the equipment, the facilities, the knowledge and so on to make these important environmental decisions. The section also decreases the transparency as there is no requirement for the action minister to explain his or her reasoning in making a decision. This is particularly relevant in view of the Sackville decision, in which Sackville said, in specifically commenting upon that aspect, that such decisions about environmental significance are subjective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section increases uncertainty in industry about when the EIA process will be invoked and it decreases integrity by allowing developments which have already commenced to have that taken into account in decision making, thereby favouring such developments relative to actions which have not yet been started. In that case, one can have actions which are started when there has not been an EIS concluded; and these provisions allow those actions to continue, even though there has not been an EIS prepared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 1.2.3 defines `relevant environmental effect'. Depending on how this is interpreted, it may result in cumulative environmental effects being ignored, an area which the public review highlights as needing more attention, not less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 1.2.4 states that, where a proponent ought to have been designated, if the department of the action minister has failed to do so, it is to be taken to be the proponent who must notify the Environment Protection Agency of this. This paragraph has the potential to decrease the Environment Protection Agency's ability to access direct information about certain projects. It is clear that, taken together, the new procedures operate to severely undermine the objectives of the public review, that is, the review which has been going on since 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes result in more decision making power lying with people of less environmental expertise, increased ministerial discretion, and less certainty of process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will be frustrating to environmentalists, but will also entrench inequality amongst industry due to outcomes potentially depending upon political motivations. The Commonwealth could better address concerns regarding which developments will be subject to the EIA process by giving threshold levels of change within designated development lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the definition of a proposed action are for clarification purposes following Mr Justice Sackville's discussion on this matter. The changes show that only Commonwealth actions may constitute proposed actions. However, the `environmentally significant action' definition shows that it is the environmental effects of a development which may occur as a result of a licence approval, et cetera, that are to be considered in making a decision. Such changes would be acceptable to the Democrats as they make the decision taken by the minister more transparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new procedures, the minister for the environment may allow a proposed action to take place before assessment has occurred, even though he or she has determined that environmental assessment should take place. The introduction of the concept of assessment after the development has taken place makes a mockery of the EIA process. That comes from the Environmental Defender's Office in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provision clearly reduces the integrity of Commonwealth EIA processes. This is especially so as, in making a decision, the environment minister must take into account any advice given by the action minister or relevant authority and may grant permission if it is in the public interest to do so. It makes the serious investigation of alternatives in a cost effective manner close to impossible. That the commencement of such a development must be taken into account in deciding whether further environmental assessment should occur further destroys the integrity and usefulness of the assessment system and increases inequality amongst developments which have started compared with those which have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New procedure 11.4 allows the action minister to request the environment minister to exempt a proposed Commonwealth action or a class of Commonwealth actions from all or any of the requirements of the procedures completely for a specified time or until the occurrence of a specified event. These changes are unacceptable as they further increase the opportunity for discrimination between proposed developments depending upon the political climate. Only motives which ensure accountability and certainty of process should be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, it may be seen that these changes will result in a weakening of the Commonwealth EIA process. It is of particular concern that many more decisions are to be left with the action minister, who may be lacking in environmental expertise and/or will. As stated by the Environmental Defender's Office, the government's claim that this is being done to increase efficiency is not very strong, as it can hardly be considered onerous on the action minister to designate a proponent to the environment minister, who may then make the desired decisions from a position of know ledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed changes do not support the ambitions of the public review in any way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth ought to be an expert on interpretations of the law which cannot be substantiated. For 20 years it has turned a blind eye to the obvious meaning of the words, adopting an interpretation which crippled the EIA at the Commonwealth level.

The action minister has the responsibility for initiating the environmental assessment process.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sackville decision delivered to the EPA the power to play a role. As soon as a new step was taken in relation to a proposal which could affect the environment to a significant extent, then the EPA was put in the driver's seat&mdash;where it should be. It did not matter that an EIS had been done in the past. It did not matter that the action minister did not consider a variation in the proposal to be significant. And it is not that minister's decision and that minister does not have the expertise to make the decision any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point being made is that not all decisions will require referral. This is a big deal! While not all decisions will need to be referred because of the Sackville exception, most would. The ones which would not be referred would be because there has been an assessment process recently and the decision did not have the new quality of an initiative. The Sackville exception would cover the often-cited case of a coal export licence every month, which was used as an example to say that the administrative procedures were unworkable after Sackville. This is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry lobbied the government, saying that the sky was falling. Talk of an unsubstantiated interpretation of Sackville! The EPA went weak at the knees and has effectively handed the threshold determination of when a matter should be assessed back to the action minister. After 20 years&mdash;and I know this personally because I was a member of the ACF council back in 1974 when the then Labor government passed this legislation, and we worried even then about the fact that this legislation made the action minister not the minister for the environment&mdash;waiting for the ball on the wing, they passed the ball and did not like the pressure. They ran into touch. Why is the environment minister shying away from extending his own powers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sackville did leave the door open for exceptions. The scope of the exception is uncertain, but a reasonable analysis would conclude that, once a coal mine had been designated, for example, as a result of an export licence application, it would be some time before it needed to be designated again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Annual referral is not excessive and there is a precedent for this arrangement. The Australian Heritage Commission Act requires that advice be sought each year in relation to many approvals. An annual referral to the EPA would enable the EPA to keep a matter under review and for the environment minister to decide, based on the matters listed in clause 3.1.2, if and when further assessment should be done. The burden on the action minister is negligible&mdash;one letter each year for matters affecting the environment to a significant extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Resources, Mr Beddall, has recently designated proponents in relation to 1995 and 1996 woodchip licences throughout the country. The EPA would need to update its information each year on these major projects. Some say this is an appropriate role for the EPA. The resources minister has already indicated the fashion in which such changes will be interpreted. In his reasons for not designating Harris Daishowa in relation to its woodchip licence application last year, he asserts that the additional logging&mdash;this is the example I referred to earlier&mdash;of 172,000 tonnes from Victoria, which has not been the subject of environment assessment, is not significant. What nonsense!<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This assertion may appear unreasonable to ordinary people, but it is quite a different matter to prove to a Federal Court judge that this conclusion was so unreasonable that it was not open to the minister to so conclude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision as to whether the nature or extent of an environmental impact has changed lies with the action minister. This perpetuates the problem of the action minister not being the minister with the expertise to ascertain significance and not being the minister with an interest in ensuring that the action takes place. Woodchip licences around the country could be increased by 20 per cent each without designation. It would be a risky and expensive exercise for a conservation group to convince a court that the action minister was totally unreasonable in saying that a 20 per cent increase was not significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The giving of approval without the results of assessment has occurred on several occasions. For example, the Sawmillers Exports licence to export woodchips from the north coast of New South Wales was designated in 1990 and a final EIS was not produced until May 1994. During this period of four years, woodchips continued to be exported pursuant to annual licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the Minister for Resources has designated Midway Forest Products in Victoria and, at the same time, granted a woodchip export licence. These ongoing projects are allowed to continue despite the action minister's earlier unlawful failure to designate until some intermediate assessment process takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments have the effect of leaving the action minister with the power to make the crucial decision about when further environmental assessment may be appropriate. Post-Sackville, that power resided with the environment minister&mdash;where it should reside because there can be little argument about major projects affecting the environment resulting in a designation. The impact of an incremental change is harder to prove. If designation is required only when there has been a significant change in the project or the environmental impact, and that determination is made by the action minister, we are much worse off than post-Sackville. The amendments will have gone further than they need to have gone to address the alleged problems of proposals being designated too frequently, or there being uncertainty about when to designate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `ongoing project' exemption implicitly acknowledges that there are projects operating which ought to have been designated and which have not&mdash;in breach of the law. The ongoing project exemptions should be limited in time by a sunset clause. The EPA's threats that if these procedures are overturned, worse ones will be put in place by the government, make me wonder why we are participating in a Commonwealth EIA review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen in relation to these proposed changes is blackmail by the government which is claiming that if we do not accept these changes the minister for the environment will have even worse changes imposed on him by his cabinet colleagues.

I have consulted with a number of groups and it seems to me that there is concern about what happened post-Gunns and how the issues that were raised in that case will be effectively addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I put the argument that this increases uncertainty. Senator Coulter is worried about the potential for increased politicisation of environmental decisions. I think that is a very real concern. He is concerned about the role of the action minister and that it decreases transparency. They were some of the arguments that Senator Coulter put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great need to restore certainty. There are often various routes for restoring certainty but, nonetheless, I think there is common ground in all parts of the chamber that it is important that all players in this arena know and understand the rules of the game as the rules can provide a basis for action which will lead to outcomes which are predictable. I agree with Senator Coulter on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the big issues that we are facing in the environmental debate is the politicisation which has occurred across whole areas of the environment, areas in which the politicisation probably should not have gone so far. Of course people of goodwill will always differ. At the end of the day we must expect politics to play some role. But it has struck me as I have listened to the environmental debate and spoken to people that there is a very widespread concern about how often the politics of a decision overrides the science of a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one example that Senator Coulter did not cite was the astonishing final decision made on export licences. An ALP senior member of parliament in Tasmania boasted that, because of his particular action, some of the coupes which may have been approved for licence were transferred out of that state into another state. Other people were concerned about the decisions which were made on the coupes in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot think of anything which is more designed to weaken public confidence than the feeling that the government and ministers are playing politics with environmental decisions rather than making those decisions on the basis of scientific evidence. I thought that Senator Coulter raised a good point about that. It is a debate I think we should look at carefully to see how we can ensure that the processes by which the EISs are done provide a basis for confidence so that people can be assured that, when a decision is made, it is made on the basis of the best scientific environmental evidence available. That is important. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those views and the principles Senator Coulter outlined are shared by all people. The question is, as I have said, `How do we arrive at an appropriate determination?' Senator Faulkner, let us face it, had a very difficult decision to make; he had a difficult time over this issue. The proposal which is before us attempts to clarify the role of the action ministers in issuing export licences and makes it clear that an existing project does not require a new environmental impact study every time an export shipment is proposed. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there was great uncertainty after the Gunns case. As I said, Senator Coulter expressed some concerns from his particular perspective. In many ways they are not dissimilar from the perspectives that are expressed on the other side of the spectrum from industry. There were concerns in that area that projects which had never been designated, in other words subject to an environmental impact assessment, may now require such an assessment and proposals which had previously been environmentally assessed could be held to require further assessment if they are of a significantly different nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested that Senator Coulter felt that the role of Senator Faulkner as minister for the environment had been restricted. Other people have put the view to me that part of the problem is that his role has been expanded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendments to these administrative procedures made under section 6 of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 were tabled on 11 May. As a number of speakers have mentioned, these amendments were triggered by the decision of Mr Justice Sackville in the Federal Court in the Gunns case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that case the court examined aspects of the administrative procedures not previously subject to judicial scrutiny. Following the Gunns decision, the government received advice that the case had implications for all areas of government decision making. The court's decision meant that whenever the government considered granting, for example, an export licence for coal or for bauxite, the environmental consequences of that decision needed to be considered. This was the case regardless of whether the project had already undergone environmental impact assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government, of course, makes a very significant number of such decisions on a weekly basis. For example, some coalmines in effect require several export approvals in a single month. Under the previous procedures, as interpreted by the Federal Court, every export approval decision for those coalmines would need to be referred to the Environment Protection Agency for re-examination. Frankly, to allow such a situation to continue not only would create unnecessary delays, and certainly a significant level of uncertainty for industry, but also would, as a very important point, waste and distract resources away from the environmental assessment of new or changed projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to avoid this particular situation the government has amended the administrative procedures made under the Environment Protection Act. The amendments removed the need for operational activities to be referred to the Environment Protection Agency if there has already been an environmental assessment. Where projects requiring Commonwealth approvals have not previously been assessed, the government's responsibilities to assess that project remain. Where a project requiring Commonwealth approvals has been assessed but has undergone environmentally significant changes since that assessment, that project must be referred again to the Environment Protection Agency to ensure the altered environmental conditions are taken into account when the next Commonwealth approvals are given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide me with the power to allow day-to-day decisions to be made for an existing project while that project undergoes assessment. I do note the concerns that Senator Coulter has outlined to the Senate during this debate and on previous occasions that, under the amendments, judgments on which projects should be referred to the Environment Protection Agency remain with industry or, if one likes, approvals ministers. Of course, they are termed `action ministers' in the procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this point I would draw the Senate's attention to the current review of the Environment Protection Act that is in fact being undertaken now by the EPA. Through that review the EPA has identified a range of issues which arise from the Commonwealth's current environmental impact assessment procedures. One such issue is the appropriate role of the environment minister in the determination of which projects should be environmentally assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review process has ensured that all stakeholders, including state governments, industry, community groups and environment groups, have had ample opportunity to put their own views on how the Commonwealth's assessment process can be approved. Given that this public review process is well under way, it would have been highly inappropriate for the government to have addressed the broader issues such as the role of the environment minister before the EPA reported on the consultations that have taken place with stakeholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, therefore, has elected to make these current amendments consistent with the current legislative framework. Let me state clearly that while these particular amendments are essential to allow important Australian industries to operate without delay or unwarranted uncertainty, and to ensure Commonwealth environmental assessment focuses on real environmental issues, nothing in these changes pre-empts the outcomes of the consultative review process that is currently under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is through the review of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act that the issues raised by Senator Coulter should be pursued, not through the disallowance of these regulations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting Senator Coulter in this debate, I would like to disagree with the very last thing that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) observed. He congratulated the shadow minister for getting it right. I cannot understand how that can possibly be a characterisation of the speech made by Senator Kemp in that he recognised the accuracy of that said by Senator Coulter and yet apparently turned his tail on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This order was provoked by the consequences of what is now known as the Gunns case, as determined by Justice Sackville. As Senator Coulter mentioned, I had some little part to play in that Gunns case&mdash;and happily so. It was made clear to me that the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) had not acted in accordance with the procedures that he was required to follow when granting an export licence to the company Gunns. History has shown that the community group, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, was correct in its assessment that the minister had followed wrong procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is crucial that community groups such as the Tasmanian Conservation Trust retain the opportunity to hold ministers to account and to challenge them in the courts of Australia. Because of this belief and because my colleague Senator Spindler adheres to that belief, we have established a woodchip licence fighting fund which has received very strong community support to enable community groups to continue to challenge ministerial actions where they have prima facie evidence that such actions were faulty. That fund is being used at the moment by three groups to challenge licences that have been granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier we debated the need for the order that we have in front of us. I was assured that such an order would serve only to clarify the consequences of the EPIP Act so that all Australian exports would not be unintentionally frustrated. That sounded reasonable to me. If the order had just done that, it may have been supported. But that is not what it does. In fact, as Senator Coulter rightly pointed out, it has far greater consequences. It changes the environment impact assessment role in export licensing, and it reduces the capacity of the environment minister to discharge the duties required of the environment minister, which is to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we accept this, we will be creating a situation which will provoke more controversy, more extreme reactions and more uncertainty for Australia's exporters. I think that is a matter which the minister for the environment asserted would not be the case. We will continue that uncertainty, which has provoked so much political polarisation in our past. The fact is that the government has baulked, it has panicked and it has introduced a proposal which will not resolve the controversies in Australia's forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise other matters which deserve urgent attention and which are related to this issue. I remind the Senate that, for many years now, I have been pursuing the very poor level of compliance with forest management and timber harvesting practices. This is an area that I am greatly concerned about. I am greatly concerned that the minister for the environment seems to have little power to actively supervise licence conditions, and the Minister for Resources has little reason to supervise those conditions. As Senator Coulter has said, this order will change the balance even further. It will change the balance to favour more the action minister and will reduce even further the opportunity for the minister for the environment to pursue resource users who have not operated within the environmental requirements of licence conditions. It is that aspect of this change that concerns me almost as much as the constraint on the community's opportunity to initiate legal challenges to licences that have been granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to pursue and take up the Senate's time any more rehearsing the arguments which have been so coherently and cogently presented by Senator Coulter, other than to express my own personal interest in this area. I cannot let pass the statement made by Senator Faulkner at the end of his contribution about the review process which is taking place.

These changes are a direct response to the protection of the environment being upheld in the Federal Court which found that the 1994 Gunns woodchip export licence had been approved illegally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that, although the government talks of coals and other minerals, the changes are clearly targeted at woodchip export licences. Having found that it has been acting unlawfully for 20 years, the government has resolved the issue by changing the law. This chamber has witnessed many repeated instances of this kind of action by the government. For example, when the application of migration law was found to be illegal by the courts, legislation was pushed through this parliament to make illegal conduct legal. It is a very objectionable procedure, and that is why it deserves the serious consideration that this debate gives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in section 4 of the amendments extend the powers of the action minister and weaken the assessment procedures by allowing new projects to be excluded from assessment. The term `fully examined' appears to be redefined to mean, in some instances, examination by a minister without the necessary expertise and with a primary interest in allowing the proposal to go ahead, to determine whether to refer an operation to the environment minister for assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the previous regulations, the action minister decided whether a proposed project was likely to affect the environment to a significant extent. The minister for the environment then investigated the nature and extent of that impact and what action was required. Now the action minister is required to make specialised decisions on whether the impact on the environment is of a significantly different nature or significantly adds to the effect of the impact of a previously assessed operation. It is a bit like putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now the potential for each incremental change not to be significant but for the overall effect to be as great as the initial action. The changes in this section would permit the Minister for Resources to do what he did in granting an export woodchip licence to Gunns. In this instance, the minister granted a woodchip licence to a new company for an additional amount of woodchips on the basis that this was covered by the 1985 Tasmanian woodchip environmental impact statement, even though the environmental impact of the required additional logging was not assessed in this EIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in section 6 of the amendments legitimise a practice which has been occurring for some time&mdash;that is, allowing development to take place before environmental assessment. This is the case both for the extension of existing operations and for new proposals. The Sackville ruling was that the resources minister, as the action minister, failed to follow proper process when Gunns Ltd applied for a woodchip export licence. The resources minister did not consider, as required under the act, whether the proposed action affected or was likely to affect the environment to a significant extent; he decided that this impact had already been taken into account in an earlier environmental impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the Sackville decision is that, whenever a proposed action is likely to have a significant effect on the environment, it should be referred to the environment minister for assessment. It would seem to me that, if there is a significant environmental effect, the environment minister is the proper minister to assess this impact and determine what action should be taken. If the proposed action is part of an ongoing operation that has already been assessed, the environment minister is still the appropriate minister to monitor the effect of this subsequent action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Gunns case, Justice Sackville found that the Gunns proposal for the production, transport and export of woodchips had not been previously proposed by Gunns or any other company. This means that the Gunns proposal was unrelated to earlier environmental assessments. The danger of these proposed amendments, which are being allowed, unfortunately, by the Senate's failure to disallow them, is that of an unqualified, less interested action minister not fully examining the environmental impact of proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major drawbacks to the current Commonwealth environment impact assessment is the lack of ongoing monitoring and evaluation of environmental impacts. Following the procedures as ruled by Justice Sackville would allow for this and for the primary assessment role to be taken by the appropriate minister&mdash;that is, the environment minister. However, this does not have to be an involved or complicated procedure. Not all referrals to the minister require the preparation of an environment impact statement or a public environment report. A letter to the environment minister is all that is required. The minister is then kept informed of operations affecting the environment. Should the impact be such that further assessment is required, then this should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Senator Faulkner was pointing out that it involved a much greater workload, the point we are making is that it will be a less risky process if the environment minister has it because he will have the best information to determine the level of assessment that is required. In a media release, Senator Faulkner stated that these amendments would not remove the need for a fresh assessment where there is an environmentally significant change in circumstances since the last assessment. He outlined the circumstances as possibly being an increase in the scale of operation, the introduction of new technology or a change in geographical location beyond what had previously been assessed. Another consideration is the length of time since the previous assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these changes are not spelt out. If the action minister is to make the decision as to what is an environmentally significant change, then this needs to be clearly stated. The proposed new paragraph 1.2.2 should expressly outline the factors the action minister should consider. To ensure proper protection of the environment, section 6 of the amendments which allows permission to be given to perform ongoing operations before complying with the procedures needs to include a caveat to limit when this can occur. An operation should be allowed to continue only after it has been designated, if it has been properly assessed and the operations being carried out are limited solely to those approved under the assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his media release announcing the changes, the environment minister said that the changes will not remove or weaken the opportunity for legal action in relation to previous environmental decisions. This is not the case. I know of at least one instance in which a case has not been proceeded with because of the changes, and probably there are and will be others. The one I know of is the Tasmanian Conservation Trust's challenge to the North Forest Products 1995 woodchip export licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad indictment on the federal environment minister that he has supported this whittling away of environment protection and what is clearly a move by his government to give primacy to development over protection of the environment. As Senator Faulkner pointed out&mdash;and he noticed my interjection&mdash;the major aim of allowing this regulation to go through is to avoid disruption to industry. It comes as no surprise to find that he finds himself in total agreement with the opposition and wants to congratulate Senator Kemp for supporting the government on this. It is worthy of condemnation that an environment minister should thus comply with a limiting and weakening of his own power, and, more than that, the actual responsibility that he holds within the community towards environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, these changes do not provide certainty. In giving the action minister even greater discretion in determining whether to assess, uncertainty is created&mdash;for industry, with the possibility of favoured treatment for political reasons; and for the community, which has a right to know that environmental protection is assured. The current environmental assessment procedures are far from perfect. However, these changes pre-empt a review that is currently being conducted and has been under way for some years now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes should be disallowed, and the purported concerns they are said to resolve should be addressed as part of the review that is already in place. The Commonwealth environmental impact assessment is currently a sham. The government is to be condemned for its latest step backwards from its obligation to ensure the protection of the environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with the impact of competition policy reform on a key area of concern to consumers, which is health and community services. There are very few savings to be made in most states in this area. Budgets have already been slashed, cut and trimmed year after year. Indeed, in most states, services have been pared back to the bone. They have endured cut after cut dressed up in various guises: efficiency premiums, productivity savings, enterprise agreements to reduce staff and&mdash;this is the latest one announced in this year's budget&mdash;changes to indexation arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This all means that less and less funding for services is available and that more and more stress is placed on fewer and fewer people who are employed to operate and provide these services. What fat there was has been well and truly cut away, exposing many people in need of services to long waits, or reduced or more expensive services. The message does not seem to be getting through to either the federal government or the state governments. They are all hell-bent on reducing expenditure so that they can go to the next election offering more tax cuts or promising that there will never be another tax increase. To them, selling apples and oranges or cars and lounge suites is similar to selling health services. I can assure them that it is not; it is very different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other countries have found out to their cost, markets or quasi-markets simply do not work in some areas. Unfortunately, we seem to be unable to learn from the mistakes of others. Even where competition does work to a limited extent, you end up sacrificing equity, quality or choice, or all three. You end up with access to services limited to the well-off or the very poor, and those officially described as such. Those who miss out particularly are the workers on low incomes&mdash;precisely those battlers about whom the government and the coalition profess to be so concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules have to be different for these sorts of basic services. Governments these days are so dominated by their obsession with the bottom line that they will quite happily shift the provision of an essential service to whoever will take it on. They also think that they can get rid of the responsibility along with it. Someone else will be blamed when the wheels begin to fall off this brand new vision. All that matters now is price&mdash;service is cheap and gets cheaper. Forget about equity, standards and quality. I have to ask: where are the clauses in this bill that deal with any of these issues, that will guarantee that service quality will be maintained? They simply are not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to look now at some specific examples of what is happening in Victoria. At the outset, everyone gives lip service to the idea of quality. Local councils&mdash;if we have any real local councils in Victoria these days&mdash;say that they are determined to maintain quality. When maternal and child health care services are put out to tender, we initially see a genuine effort to ensure that fully trained staff are still required; that those winning tenders are those offering a good service and are not for-profit bodies; that outreach programs, extra visits, preventative care, connecting services, and so on, continue to operate fully. But how long can they hold out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you talk to people working at ground level in these sorts of community services, they will tell you the same thing: with more and more government cuts, with government intervention insisting on cheaper and lower quality tenders, with the acceptance of these tenders, and with more financial pressure to cut costs even further, local councils will not be able to continue to deliver quality services. This is already happening. In Victoria, the state government funds only 40 to 50 per cent of services through the healthy futures program but one council reports that its staff spends 80 per cent of its time dealing with that very program. The pressure is now on to reduce that level of staff commitment to these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As services are being contracted out, skilled staff are being lost. It is cheaper to employ unskilled or partly skilled staff. Meanwhile, the incomes are being reduced for those employed in what are in many instances some of the lowest paid but most important jobs in the community. This is not about efficiency, productivity, choice or benefit to the consumers. This is about reducing the government's costs in the name of competition and to hell with the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another front in Victoria, nurses' case loads are increasing substantially. The Victorian government rewards case loads of 180 birth notifications per nurse. One council area is just managing to make 140 birth notifications per nurse but the stresses are increasing enormously. That council's commissioners believe that 150 birth notifications per nurse is possible, but many other councils report that they are nowhere near those figures and that their nurses are already working to absolute maximum capacity and are showing early signs of burnout. How could that possibly be described as economically efficient? How will nurses possibly meet the targets that the government is setting? We have to recognise that the free market simply does not work. It certainly has not worked in other health and community services areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another good example is pharmacy. Government and industry have combined to draw up an industry plan that restricts the location of businesses and reduces the number of outlets able to dispense medication. That came about because everyone was forced to acknowledge that letting the market operate unrestricted had resulted in increasing pressure on prices as costs increased because many businesses and operators were struggling to survive. There was an agreement to rationalise the number and distribution of pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement struck between the government and the industry has seen a 10 per cent reduction in the total number of pharmacies throughout Australia. In areas where too many pharmacies were operating&mdash;there were so many that most, if not all, were unprofitable&mdash;pharmacists have been paid to move out of the industry. Meanwhile, special support is available for rural and remote areas to ensure that services are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are facing the same lesson in the area of child care. As we rely on market forces there is a clear maldistribution of centres, and this has occurred particularly following the extension of public subsidies to private centres. In many coastal Queensland cities and on the north coast of New South Wales there is a huge oversupply of child care places. There are centres half full and centres that have already gone bankrupt. Meanwhile, in Melbourne, when a parent has a job it is impossible in some areas to get access&mdash;even priority one access&mdash;to any child-care centre whatsoever. Indeed, people are being forced to leave the work force or not take up work options. That is how the free market in child care is operating. There may be some competition but it is hardly efficient and, in many areas, it is certainly not of any great benefit to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a classic case of the need for government intervention&mdash;for government to sit down with industry, as it did with the pharmacies, and look at the best way to ensure that competition actually benefits consumers. If that means, as it did for the pharmacies, that some centres have to close down so that others can open, surely that is better than the current situation. There are many areas where competition should not be the overriding feature for the delivery of services. These are the areas where we, as a community, decide we have priorities over competition. We decide that we are putting access or equity considerations first. This goes across a range of areas&mdash;education, health, community support services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say that competition does not matter or is a secondary consideration because our first concern is to see that low income earners or people with disabilities, for example, get priority access to a particular service or that a particular service is shared out equally amongst all of us. That is what communities do. That is why we have governments. We have priorities beyond competition&mdash;priorities which we look to the government to uphold. If competition becomes the be-all and end-all, not only do consumers lose out but we also abrogate those community priorities and responsibilities. That is what is wrong with this bill. That is what is wrong with this ideology-driven approach to competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, competition is generally a good thing but the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 is not just about competition. It could end up being about creating another bureaucratic empire which will be unaccountable to the people and outside the control of the parliament. It could end up saddling businesses and family consumers with high utility charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For decades, especially since 1932, this Senate has scrutinised delegated legislation. We should never tolerate the elimination of parliamentary scrutiny through the creation of new bureaucratic structures. Only last Friday, at the National Conference on Microeconomic Reform and Federalism, the chairman of the Western Australian parliament's standing committee rightly attacked the creation of authorities and commissions, the edicts of which are beyond parliamentary scrutiny. This bill has no provisions for parliamentary scrutiny of access, pricing or dividend policies of semi-government bodies in control of billions of dollars worth of taxpayer funded infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Ted Kolsen of the University of Queensland has described the new competition policy as naive. He has criticised its failure to take account of what is called in the jargon `second best realities'. He has pointed out that open access regimes can lead to inefficiency and the imposition of user charges in excess of economically efficient and marginal cost pricing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Huge changes are being proposed to the financing and charging of public utilities; yet the impact on rural and regional Australia&mdash;such as my own state of Tasmania&mdash;has not been studied. The bill does not lay down any guidelines regarding pricing principles for access to public utilities. Professor Kolsen and the Business Council of Australia have questioned the extent to which the interpretation of the access provisions will deter investment in facilities open to others on uncertain terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's own Economic Planning Advisory Commission on almost the last page of its interim report on infrastructure has acknowledged that there is a conflict between private property rights and the requirement that a private owner can be forced to make his infrastructure available to users. Its response has been that `only time will tell' whether the Competition Commission gets it right. This is simply not a satisfactory basis for any law, let alone this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has increasingly raided public authorities for revenue: for example, forced dividends from selling off the Reserve Bank's foreign exchange reserves. It has reaped in hundreds of millions of dollars from Telecom in this budget. Users of infrastructure need protection against exploitation of natural monopolies by greedy treasurers. The bill should, at the very least, be amended so that in regard to Commonwealth statutory authorities and business enterprises parliament can disallow any dividend to the Commonwealth and thus ensure that parliament retains control of the purse. I will have potluck in that attempt, might I say, because both major parties will deny that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition bill implies the pursuit of full cost recovery from the users of public utilities. The Prices Surveillance Authority in its submission to the review of national competition policy did not question full cost recovery from users; yet the PSA pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">prices charged by state authorities have increased much more rapidly than CPI. In the two years ending December 1992 selected state and local government charges (including water, gas and electricity charges) increased by 10 per cent&mdash;over eight times the increase of the CPI of 1.2%, excluding those charges.'</PARA>
<PARA>The PSA even suggested that `public authority prices are often too low rather than too high'. Now there is a warning of price increases to come! Yet infrastructure by its very nature often confers external benefits on non-users such as landholders and governments which gain increased value or taxes from the economic activities which infrastructure supports. The correct economic principle is that of `beneficiary pays', not `user pays'. Neither EPAC nor the Industry Commission have satisfactorily explained how these external benefits can be properly taken into account in determining when and where infrastructure should be created and at what cost it should be made available to users. For example, the Industry Commission argues for imposing user charges for water supply instead of land rates, but then it admitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, commercial land prices would tend to rise if this tax on business users were eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the actual production of goods and services, as opposed to landholding, would gain nothing. Business and consumers would not gain: they would be subjected to new user charges and no reduction in rents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made of the extra national income that can be gained from increased productivity and the shaking up of inefficient public utilities, but the $64 question is who is getting the gains. The Australian Automobile Association in January 1995 pointed out the massive increase in indirect taxation that is taking place in Australia under the guise of user charges. The association stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the commercialisation and privatisation of Government business enterprises such as communications, electricity, water and sewerage have been accompanied by State and Federal Treasuries transferring existing funded public assets to GBEs at replacement value and imposing spurious `dividend' requirements on Government business enterprises which in turn must be recovered by `user charges'.</PARA>
<PARA>The result has been a recent meteoric rise in indirect taxation in Australia disguised as user charges. This form of tax has increased by 650 per cent since 1987-88 from $400 million to $3 billion. Nor is it likely to decrease. South Australia has just doubled the value it puts on its electricity and water assets and announced that it is looking for a six per cent return on the doubled asset base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has questioned Victoria's electricity reform and points out that increased competition in the electricity industry may lead to rises in prices as public investment is wound back. Not only have businesses and families had to pay for spuriously valued assets&mdash;assets that they owned in the first place&mdash;but they have also been denied the lion's share of efficiency gains. In a media release of 26 July 1994 EPAC admitted that labour shedding has been important in increasing the productivity of government business enterprises. EPAC also admitted that many of the benefits of increased productivity have been passed on to governments in the form of increased dividends. In plain English, the Commonwealth has cut the states' share of income tax so that it can use the money on its spending programs to buy votes. </PARA>

Meanwhile, businesses and families pay twice over. Their utility bills are much the same as they were before, but they now have to pay more tax to support the unemployed. Meanwhile, the public utilities show spurious productivity gains by deferring necessary maintenance. It is a scheme of `off-balance-sheet' financing to arouse the admiration of the most sophisticated corporate financial adviser. It allows the government to claim credit while picking people's pockets on the sly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am all in favour of free and fair competition. I am all in favour of efficiency and productivity. But I am not so naive as to believe that this is all that is behind this bill. From the point of view of revenue greedy treasuries this bill is as much about setting the stage for `off-budget' revenue raising. Governments want to spend money buying votes so they turn every water and electricity bill into a tax. They sell off every asset they can find, from airports, to the Commonwealth Bank, to foreign exchange reserves, and now our airline, Qantas. When governments find out that they have no infrastructure left, or they need to invest more, they implement a compulsory superannuation levy to force workers to pump money into superannuation funds which will build or buy the airports, the electricity and the water infrastructure and what have you. The funds will be guaranteed full cost recovery and a guaranteed profit on their investment. </PARA>

The only problem is that like the more spectacular entrepreneurial plays of the 1980s it will all come unstuck. Workers will see superannuation levies as taxes.

<PARA>No wonder states are rushing to revalue their utility assets! The Treasury has glossed over the problem of natural monopoly and the fact that pricing above marginal cost is simply another form of indirect taxation. The Treasury has admitted that it has not undertaken an examination of the income redistribution effects of changes in charges for public utility services resulting from these reforms, and that is where I come in. I am concerned that they will adversely affect low-income workers and regional Australia, including my state of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury has not even denied that user charges in excess of marginal costs could not be rebated without breaching the GATT subsidy code. In other words, exporters would be better off with overt indirect taxation which could be rebated, instead of disguised indirect taxation through user charges which cannot be rebated. When all our competitors rebate their indirect taxes through VAT refund arrangements, it is more than a little silly for Australia to pursue infrastructure pricing policies which will hamstring exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury has failed to answer questions on the impact of full cost recovery on rural and regional Australia and the implied bias towards excessive metropolitan urbanisation. That is very important. I asked this question, I think, of the Bureau of Immigration Research. I asked whether the bureau had done any study about the effect this would have on the increased urbanisation of Australia. But no; it had not even thought of it. The Treasury has not done it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the whole scheme of access is designed to end up in the High Court if infrastructure suppliers are compelled to make infrastructure available at loss-generating marginal cost. The imposition of third party access on private owners of infrastructure could amount to a taking of property without just compensation, in which case the taxpayer will have to bear the cost. In other words, the taxpayer may end up having to pay for infrastructure which he or she does not even own. Before the parliament legislates to impose such a contingent liability on taxpayers, taxpayers are entitled to have some idea as to what the potential liability will be. If the taxpayer has to bear the cost of providing infrastructure, it is reasonable that the infrastructure be publicly owned and available to all. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">1.What, if any, criteria are set out in the Bill to establish pricing guidelines for access to declared essential infrastructure where a determination is made (see s44R)?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part IIIA, Division 3 of the Trade Practices Act, as established by the Competition Policy Reform Bill, contains provisions relating to access to declared services. Section 44R provides that determinations on access made by the Commission may deal with any matter relating to access by the third party to the service. Accordingly, a declaration may specify the terms and conditions of the third party's access to the service. Section 44S deals with restrictions on access determinations, while section 44T lists matters the Committee must take into account when making determinations including the legitimate business interests of service providers, the costs of providing access, the public interest and the interests of all persons who have rights to use the service. The Commission may also take into account any other matters that it thinks are relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 3 does not set out specific pricing guidelines for the Commission to follow when making determinations on access. This approach reflects the fact that there is no single economic pricing model which is applicable to any infrastructure facility in all circumstances. Accordingly, a negotiated outcome agreed between the provider and the third party is seen as being desirable&mdash;such that determinations can only be made if negotiations have failed. When making a determination the Commission will take the matters specified in section 44T into account on a case by case basis being guided by the appropriate pricing model in the circumstances. An appeal against Commission determinations will be to the Australian Competition Tribunal to guard against demonstrably inappropriate pricing decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">2.Is it intended that access to essential infrastructure will be guided by marginal cost pricing principles or by full cost recovery through user charges?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">See answer to question 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3.If it is intended that access to essential infrastructure be governed by full cost recovery through user charges how does that improve the efficiency of the economy given that the Industry Commission has conceded at p180 of its 1992-93 Annual Report that public utility monopoly pricing above marginal cost "is simply another form of indirect taxation"?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">See answer to question 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The access regime contained in Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act is relevant to certain services provided by both public and private facilities. The regime establishes two mechanisms for the provision of third party access:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a process for declaration of services which provides a basis for negotiation of access on a commercial basis. This is backed up by provisions providing for compulsory arbitration if agreement cannot be reached by negotiation; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a procedure whereby service providers can offer undertakings which set out terms on which a provider will grant access to third parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both circumstances, the intention is to achieve an outcome consistent with normal commercial practices, which seeks a return on fixed assets. The access regime will promote economic efficiency by encouraging competition in markets upstream or downstream from infrastructure facilities. Efficiency will also be encouraged through increased utilisation of infrastructure. Furthermore, these outcomes are not necessarily dependent upon short run marginal cost pricing of infrastructure. The quote from the Industry Commission 1992-93 Annual Report relates specifically to Government Business Enterprises operating in uncompetitive markets. In such markets there are limited pressures to operate efficiently and in some cases capital investments have not always been undertaken on a commercial basis. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authority for the Commission and the State Governments to raise revenue through taxation is provided under a number of sections of the Australian Constitution. As a matter of law, the definition of whether revenue raised by governments in Australia is, or is not taxation is therefore a matter for interpretation by the High Court. The High Court has previously defined taxation as, `. . . a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes . . . and is not a payment for services rendered.' (Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board (Vic) (1938) 60 CLR 263, 176 and 190). Section 53 of the Constitution also distinguishes between taxation and `. . . imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties or fees for services'. Because access charges will be set by reference to the service provided, it seems unlikely that they could be construed as a tax.</PARA>

If on the other hand, the need for compensation is avoided by allowing access to infrastructure only on a full cost recovery basis, is not economic efficiency damaged by charging more than marginal cost?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The access regime in the Competition Policy Reform Bill has been developed and drafted in accordance with legal advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department, and the Government is satisfied that it is valid under the Australian Constitution.</PARA>

It ensures that access legislation is valid by creating a liability to pay compensation. Provisions similar to section 44ZZJ appear in a number of Commonwealth Acts, and they are sufficient to fulfil the requirements of `just terms' in subsection 51(xxxi) of the Constitution (see Minister for Primary Industries and Energy v Davey (1994) 119 ALR 108).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the short answer to all five questions is that to this point in time no research on these specific questions has been carried out, the Department is currently developing the capacity to handle such research. In the first instance, the data for answering such questions is not yet completely available. Although we have personal income and business income details, these are not sufficient and they are on a taxable income basis not gross, nor is information available on the prevailing tax incentives for attracting businesses to regional locations. Moreover, when the data does become available it has to be reconfigured into a usable format at the regional level. This is currently taking place within the Data Section of the Department. The Department is also commissioning ABS to review the regional expenditure of the Commonwealth which should improve the capacity to examine public expenditure flows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To answer these questions satisfactorily also requires the development of a modelling capacity to use the data. The development of an in-house capacity to model such questions is currently taking place within the Economic Analysis Section. For example, a Regional Economic Modellers Reference Group has been convened to advise on which models should be used. It is expected they will give their recommendation in a few months time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is perhaps also worth noting that regions as defined by the program cover both urban and non-urban. Moreover, many factors combine to effect regional competitiveness and the program attempts to look at the question more broadly than simply what the cost structure of non-urban enterprises might be. Leadership, skills, market awareness, opportunities for value-adding, infrastructure, specific funding for projects and so on, comprise the package of measures and approaches advocated by the program. For example, through the provision of infrastructure funding this seeks to improve the cost structure of enterprises in regions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some may argue that the move to cost recovery will impact adversely on the cost structure of some enterprises within many non-urban regions, but on the other hand the removal of resource allocation distortions will improve the business environment and cost structure of others. This would occur as a result of microeconomic reform and outcomes would also depend upon the level of competition generated within a region. The net result will vary from region to region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, the point I was making earlier was that the federal system is a system that requires agreements between governments. The fact that you have to get agreements between governments makes the role played by parliament less than it would be if this legislation had to go through this parliament only and was concerned with this jurisdiction only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there has been debate on this issue, as has been proved by those who have gone before me and who will come after me. It is also clear that legislation like this, which is going to become more and more frequent, is largely determined by what state, territory and federal governments do. I do not have a great deal of difficulty with that as long as people keep in mind the ultimate purpose of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate purpose of government is to have a community which enables all its members to live in peace, freedom and security; properly fed, clothed and housed; well educated and provided with good facilities for the recreation of their mind and body; and with decent health care available to them. Government must ensure the integrity of society and its capacity to accommodate all within it fairly, having proper car for their well-being and dedicated to their happy future both short- and long-term. Government must employ all legitimate means, including social, cultural, economic, legal and environmental, to achieve its ultimate purpose. It should not allow the use of one or more of them to usurp the right role of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition does much for the good of the community. That has been stated again and again in the debate. In so far as it does, government must nurture it. It is most beneficial where it operates in its proper place among other forces. It seems to me that we have to bear in mind that competition is only one of a number of instruments that are available to governments and the community to produce a good society. If competition gets out of its proper place and starts to do the things that Senator Lees, Senator Harradine and others have suggested, then it ought to be brought back and put in its proper place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees and others have talked about community service obligations and certainly, at times, the force of that community service obligation should predominate over the force of competition where it is appropriate in terms of the sort of society we want and which I have described. If such things as water and electricity and gas, those essential provisions for a decent life, are not available, and competition is not making them available, other forces should come into play. Government should see to it that people are properly provided with those things. If government does not do that, government is not living up to its duty. That is not an argument against competition; that is an argument in favour of society and in favour of using a range of tools to get to the result that we want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation that we are dealing with at the moment&mdash;it has been criticised by Senator Harradine, and he repeated the criticism of others&mdash;must be read with all of this in mind. This legislation will work well if the competition it promotes is kept within the context of the range of tools that are needed to develop the sort of society Australia wants. Clearly, there are cases where competition must be put down and must be subjugated to other forces. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that expression does remind me of horses, Senator Calvert. It is probably an apt phrase to use because there is no doubt that competition can get out of control, can gallop away, if the proper restraint is not applied to it. That is what we must be careful of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came across an example in this very building today, where competition forces and often its twin, market forces, have to be restrained. I do not want to go too deeply into this, because I have to get the full details. I do not know whether you know, Senator Calvert, but the nurses at the station in Parliament House are now in some difficulty. If you accept what they say&mdash;and I have at this stage an inclination to do so, although I am always subject to correction&mdash;in the interests of the money that is available to management, and no doubt in the light of the general thrust of what we are talking about today, they will have their wages reduced from 1 July without proper consultation. There was, as I understand it, an enterprise agreement, which may not be persisted with&mdash;not as a result of what they want, but as a result of what management wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is a consideration that should be taken into account in the sorts of things we are talking about. People who are working should not be subject to a particular force that is let loose blindly, but there are other matters that should be taken into account, such as the need for people to have a proper wage, for people to be consulted on what they are going to be paid and for a true enterprise agreement to be broken only by consultation, and so on. These are the sorts of things that, if kept in mind and taken along with competition forces and with market forces, will make this legislation good legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is not applied with the proper attitude, with the proper community interests kept in mind and with the proper tools used in addition to this particular tool, there can be trouble. But if it can bring good, together with these other things that I have spoken about, we will get somewhere. Competition, like all good things, may be loved too much, to paraphrase a famous judge, and may be embraced too closely. Good things must be taken in moderation, and I am sure that if we do that in this case this legislation will do much for the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is easy to forget the significance to the Commonwealth public sector of the legislative changes that the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 proposes, particularly their significance to government business enterprises. The Industry Commission in its report estimated that about $4 billion of the $23 billion estimated savings would come from Commonwealth level GBE reforms, particularly to Telstra and, to a certain extent, to Australia Post and the airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Associate Professor of Economics at James Cook University, Dr John Quiggin, points out that the commission has significantly overestimated the benefits which flow from Commonwealth GBEs under the new competition policy. He showed that the Industry Commission had mistakenly double counted the efficiency reforms already under way in Telstra, in Australia Post and in the airports. He writes that the Industry Commission makes very dubious assertions about potential benefits such as claiming that Australia can reach the productivity levels of Sweden, ignoring basic factors such as our very different geography and our different population densities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission also assumes that the abolition of the existing duopoly in the larger telephony market will result in substantial price falls, when evidence from within Australia, from the United States of America, and from elsewhere overseas suggests that the impact on Telstra's dominance of the market&mdash;in the medium term at least&mdash;is unlikely to deliver the massive gains claimed by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of airports, the Industry Commission's analysis becomes even more difficult to accept when it assumes that all Australian airports can reach the capital productivity of Sydney airport. It is unfortunately very obvious to anyone monitoring the attitudes of both the government and the opposition to the leasing of Australia's major airports that no airport is likely ever to have anything near the same throughput as Sydney. The only one which may come anywhere near close in the medium to long term is Sydney West, if and when it is built and fully operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all that, this Industry Commission report has been trumpeted as conclusive evidence of the benefits of competition policy and as the final word on whether these reforms are necessary at all. That is a great pity because the reform package has very significant ramifications at the federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade Practices Commission Chairman, Mr Alan Fels, has described the new rules for access to essential communications facilities as `the most important amendment to the Trade Practices Act' in this bill, but the debate about this has been quite minimal. Shared use and interworking both fall within the scope of this legislation we are talking about today. Those two categories encompass, amongst other things, the situations where two or more pay TV services use the same infrastructure and the problems arising from the use of a publicly-switched network service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The access to infrastructure services provisions in the bill provides for conciliation and arbitration of access disputes. That sounds fine in theory, and it is, but in practice it could prove very difficult to administer. For a start, the processes in the bill are not at all transparent. The users and consumers of a service are given minimal opportunity to influence decisions on whether a new operator should be allowed to access the service and on what conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This could become a very serious problem where the would-be competitor wants access only to the profitable part of the service, leaving the existing operator to run the non-profitable bits. In more general terms, competition in a market does not necessarily translate to greater benefits for consumers or meet public interest concerns. It does not automatically meet non-economic objectives and community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to facilities in the telecommunications field is vital for the provision of a diverse range of services and should promote diversity of ownership and control. The bill does not recognise diversity as a key objective; rather, the objective of the bill, the measurement of the benefit of competition, is primarily, of course, an economic one. Unless measures are put in place to ensure that access to distribution systems is not controlled by the few or that there are guaranteed rights of access for all, there will, in all probability, be no real diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will not achieve this end. By its very nature, and as Professor Fels concedes, it encourages agreements on access outside its provisions. This could mean that there is no scrutiny of whether the public interest is met in such arrangements. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for public comment and consultation before services are declared. The Democrats will be moving amendments to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the communications industry, the generic regulation provided by the Trade Practices Act will probably prove inadequate in dealing with the policy challenges thrown up by convergence, or the satisfaction of social policy objectives that are currently enshrined in the regulation of the communications industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Communications Law Centre, in its submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill, argues that because of the special status of the communications industry, there is a need for some industry specific regulation within the competition policy framework. But the entire policy push implicit in this bill and the COAG agreements is towards less regulation rather than more. The centre is convinced that competition will not deliver on content and diversity matters in the converged telecommunications industry, particularly with the emergence of strategic alliances between existing players. Encouraging of diversity could mean mandating anti-competitive behaviour such as the United States practice of requiring cable television operators to allocate one-third of air time to local broadcasting stations to maintain their audience penetration and, therefore, their viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that this package does not provide an adequate scheme for a transparent public interest driven access to an infrastructure services to services regime. We foresee serious problems in the future that the new ACCC will have insufficient power to police. We are concerned that the competition policy reform could lead to a lack of interest in the equally important need to regulate aspects of specific industries to achieve social policy objectives, particularly where such regulation could be perceived to be anti-competitive. In the vitally important communications industry, the Democrats need to be assured that the inadequate framework established by this bill will not be the beginning and the end of the policy push to provide a comprehensive, competitive, diverse and culturally constructive communications industry base which will be available to all on an equitable basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to various aspects of this debate on the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. Senator Kernot and Senator Coulter, and just more recently Senator Harradine, have stressed the momentous nature of this piece of legislation. Senator Bourne has just reminded us that there are serious problems in particular areas. She spoke of the telecommunications industry and the inadequate framework that this legislation delivers in that area. Even though those serious problems have been mentioned and even though speakers such as Senator Harradine have stressed with great sincerity the importance of this legislation, I am certain, from listening to other contributions, that none of those contributions have been taken seriously because attached to this legislation is a great deal of dogma and a great deal of party political commitment without a lot of thought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those who have allowed their parties to be committed had actually taken any trouble to listen to those who would be most affected by this legislation, we might have heard a little more concern, such as has been expressed in some areas by the National Party. I have certainly heard Senator Boswell express concern about the implications that this might have for rural Australia. That concern may have been translated into a little more than the rhetoric that we hear coming from so many of the other contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is based on a wing and a prayer. It is a dogmatic belief that the positive aspects of the Competition Policy Reform Bill can be delivered without any downside. This is how it has been sold to the Australian people. I recall a figure of $1,364&mdash;not $1,365, not $1,000 or $1,500, but $1,364&mdash;mentioned as the dollar benefit that Australian citizens would enjoy per person as a result of the passage of this legislation. Anybody who can confidently introduce such a precise benefit as a result of such a complicated and comprehensive piece of legislation such as this is really shooting into the wind because that so-called benefit cannot be demonstrated. I defy anybody to come in here and quantify it with such accuracy and then stand by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of the bill are vague and I do not think they can stand the scrutiny of comparison with the downsides which definitely do exist. The same argument has been used to justify free trade and lower tariffs to the Australian people in terms of allegedly lower prices from higher competition. In the end, the big retailers have got most of the benefit in higher profit margins while we see the unintended consequences far too often. Hundred of thousands of workers in the textile, clothing and footwear, and car industries have lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I predict that competition policy will work out in a similar way. Consumers may get some benefit in terms of some lower prices but the big winners will be big businesses and the treasuries of state and federal governments, perhaps. The losers will be displaced public sector workers. We will lose quality of the delivery of many of our public services such as education. Residents of regional Australia will be losers in this area. The local government sector, to which has been paid far too little regard, will be another loser in the wash-up of what we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look at the education sector. In his second reading speech the minister sought to claim that it was not the intention of the government that competition policy should relate to the core business of education. What is the core business of education? How far do you take that core business? Should schools be forced to contract out their resource needs? Should schools be required to lease their premises on a competitive basis? Should schools be forced to compete in the provision of extracurricular activities or non-core subjects? What are they&mdash;computer literacy or music? How far should schools be forced to go on sponsorship and user pays charges? None of these questions are properly addressed by this legislation and these are the questions that the people of Australia deserve to have answered before we allow this fait accompli to take effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One private sector submission to the current Industry Commission inquiry on contracting out argues that the core business should be limited to policy and service design and that all government services can be delivered by contractors even if the services are of a social nature and involve activities that are hard to specify in empirical terms. That is a possible interpretation of what is up for grabs under this bill. Imagine what radical reform of education such an approach can potentially open up, especially when you tie in the other elements of the Hilmer package, including requiring repeal of anti-competition regulations, even if they serve a social purpose and a requirement for competitive neutrality for non-core government business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The push towards corporatisation and privatisation is an inevitable part of competition policy. Several states are already seeking to move the TAFE system towards a corporatised model, with full fees and full commercial considerations. Education quality, access to free education and community involvement become inferior to the pursuit of the dollar under such corporatised models. Then we have to ask ourselves: what is education all about? Is it about making a dollar or a service to the community and an obligation of government? We find those words very hard to find in proposals such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process of corporatisation, jobs in the public sector will be lost. The Democrats are not opposed to the achievement of genuine efficiency in government, but this must not be at the cost of lower quality, fewer services, less universal access to a quality service and less accountability by the service provider to the public. None of this is guaranteed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government has ridden roughshod right over its own constituency by riding this competition policy. The Australian Education Union, the Community and Public Sector Union and the ACTU have all expressed extreme concern about the impact of this bill on their members. The job security of their members and the continuation of the services provided by their members are also matters that concern the unions I have mentioned. The government has ignored the concerns of those unions and the welfare lobby, the parents lobby, the consumer lobby, the local government sector and the environment movement. It has continued. That is why I mentioned this idea of dogma right at the beginning. I see government members who have a twinkle of concern but they are overwhelmed by this dogma and this inexorable push, ploughing on with reforms of dubious benefits and definite cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulation review process in particular has the potential to bring into question the maintenance of education standards. For many years in many states various groups have been trying to get around rules in the education area on teacher registration or examinations or curriculum or facilities, or whatever&mdash;trying to go for the lowest common denominator. Potentially, thanks to competition policy, such regulations, which have been the one protection of a child's right to education irrespective of the beliefs of the parents, should be struck down as anti-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be moving amendments later in the debate to make it quite clear that the delivery of education services is regarded not as a business activity but as an obligation of government and a right of Australians; and we will make sure that the education sector is, therefore, excluded from the operation of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other sector I want to address is local government. The local government sector has been downgraded by this reform. The sector has not been adequately consulted, and the government should be ashamed of that fact. It is a fact that the local government sector has not been adequately consulted on the implementation of the competition reform agenda, as evidenced by the fact that the original bill did not even exclude the core services of local government from being divided up and forced on to a competitive neutrality basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has since partly corrected this oversight but has not gone anywhere near far enough. The current provisions in the act will leave local government open to possible litigation under the competitive conduct provisions while state governments performing identical tasks will not be open to such litigation. Local government is clearly seen as the poor third cousin. This could leave it open for an unscrupulous business to try to use the Trade Practices Act to argue that local government fees were excessive or anti-competitive. It could severely restrict the ability of local government to use its full range of powers to protect the considered interests of local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later, in the committee stage, I will be moving amendments to the bill, as requested by the Australian Local Government Association, to ensure that local government is treated exactly the same as state and federal agencies under this bill. It is an important part of our political system. It is about time we acknowledged that and acknowledged the effect of such propositions on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To allow the potential for local government services to be challenged, to be split up and to be opened up for competition would be to mandate the export of the incredibly anti-democratic Kennett local government reforms to all the Australian states. In Victoria we are now seeing the contracting out of local government taken to an extreme extent, with community services like the running of libraries and health and recreation services being put out to tender. Quality and the concept of community service are being sacrificed in the pursuit of the holy dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government stands to pay a large part of the cost of implementing the Hilmer reforms, yet it has not been to date included in the sharing arrangements of the speculated dividend&mdash;I repeat: the `speculated' dividend&mdash;from the reforms. Competition policy could also involve higher costs for local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The water industry, for example, is one expected to be a major target of Hilmer-style reforms. This has the Australian Conservation Foundation very worried and concerned that it could lead to utilities trying to make money by selling as much water as possible while any conservation and education programs and regulations drop off as anti-competitive. Also, we are particularly concerned that the stopping of the supply of water, seen as a social need, could well proceed and people could have their water deliveries&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner suspension I mentioned that local government in Australia will continue to have problems with the proposals that are before us for a competition policy. In particular, I was making the point that the obligation to deliver water to communities throughout Australia has been previously met by local government bodies. That could well end up being a significant problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen some of the ramifications of privatising the water supply in the United Kingdom. Those in this chamber and others interested in the area who have been previously involved in local government would be horrified to learn that on some occasions the supply of water has been denied to people who cannot afford to pay for that water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the obligations that local governments have met in Australia over many decades has been to take care of the health of their residents. A significant part of the health of the nation is ensured by a reliable supply of fresh, clean water. It would be one of the potential crimes of this Hilmer concept if that supply is denied because the user cannot pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local governments, as many senators would be aware, for many years have been able, through many courses, to meet their obligations to supply water. One is that when the cash is not there to pay for the water rates, or even local government rates, there has been the capacity to make a charge against the property. They have continued to deliver the water, collect the rubbish and clear the sewage&mdash;and that charge is recouped when the property is sold. Those are the sorts of community service obligations which local governments have been able to deliver, by taking payment by methods that can be very difficult to come by when we look at the user pays and privatisation concepts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Buy-local programs by local governments could be regarded as anti-competitive as could arrangements for preferred suppliers to councils or councils being preferred builders for state main roads departments. Such arrangements ensure the integrity of some local communities and make sure they can maintain a strategic capacity to build or repair, or meet many of the needs that a local community needs to retain to call itself a community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure senators from remote areas of Australia appreciate that when the threshold size of the community declines, those sorts of things are most important. Local government is waking up to what Hilmer means to this sector. We need to ensure that the negative impacts are minimised. I hope that in the committee stage, the government and the coalition will join with us to provide a fairer deal for local government by supporting the amendments we will move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to foreshadow those amendments in a way. Senator Kernot received a letter from Mayor David Plumridge, the President of the Australian Local Government Association. He enclosed a copy of the letter that he addressed to Mr Costello, the shadow Treasurer for the coalition. With regard to the amendments that the Democrats intend to move, in the letter to the shadow Treasurer, Mr Plumridge wrote:</PARA>

<PARA>Further in his letter Mayor Plumridge wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are . . . deeply concerned that those responsible for this legislation have confused Local Government, which is just that&mdash;government, with the trading authorities of the States. The correct comparison is with the central departments of the States. This is made clear in the definition of "local government body" in proposed section 2(D)(2) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important clarification. It justifies the amendments that are being sought by the ALGA. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is quite significant. It is a major plank in the government's agenda for micro-economic reform. This bill is aimed at creating greater efficiency in the operation of the Australian economy, saving taxpayers money, creating new jobs and improving household savings. While there is contention as to the measures of savings, the numbers of jobs and the improvement in household savings, and whilst there might be some argument at the margins about how much, none of the serious commentators question that those savings will be significant and that they will be a major spurt in improving the efficiency of this economy. They will make it more globally competitive and, as a consequence, create a much better platform for Australian business to succeed in the world. They will become more competitive and thus be more effective at winning contracts, growing their Australian businesses, increasing more employment for Australians and contributing to the greater economic strength of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am one who has long held the view that the greatest and most complex difficulty in Australian politics is not the adversarial parliamentary system that we have, in which Labor and the coalition face one another for honours as to who will run the country as government, but rather the management of the Commonwealth-state relationship. We have governments with legitimate constitutional responsibilities at a state level, a Commonwealth government with its legitimate constitutional responsibilities and conflict between Commonwealth and state as to cooperation and a national view of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So strong is the basic premise for this legislation that the most vexed problem in Australian politics&mdash;the management of the Commonwealth-state relationship&mdash;is in good repair. We have a situation in which the Commonwealth and the states agree about the need for this legislation, and not only agree about it in principle but have gone a huge way down the road to putting the flesh around the bones of that agreement to make competition policy a real biting economic tool for improving the efficiency of the nation. That in itself says that the principles we are seeking to enshrine here have huge power right across the political spectrum&mdash;certainly, Labor-Liberal and National Party-Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been criticisms of this legislation in this debate by the Australian Democrats and by the Greens, who have raised serious doubts that they hold as to whether this legislation in any form should go ahead. With any major social change of the sort that we are now talking about, there are of course critics. But the level of criticism that comes forward is criticism at the margin of the principles that we are involved with here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission, in assessing the impact of this legislation&mdash;these reforms arising from the Hilmer report&mdash;estimates that, as a consequence of this legislation, national savings would be improved by $5.5 billion; 30,000 jobs would be created; it would lead to greater prosperity in the nation, pushing wages up by three per cent; and disposable income per household could rise by $1,500 per annum. They are the estimates of the Industry Commission. People criticise those estimates. No-one has been able to come forward with a better model of what they would be. But even if they are wrong and only half right, they are still, as I have said, significant changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone wishes to try to oppose this bill and knock it off the agenda paper, they are saying to Australian industry&mdash;and their voices are quite clear&mdash;`We do not want a competitive economy and you will have to fight in Asia for your markets with one hand tied behind your back.'</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that I am interjected upon. Let me complete the point. The interjection is really about the degree of reform, not the need for it. There are different views between the major parties about what constitutes the degree of reform and how best to manage reform. With the greatest of respect to you, Senator Panizza, there is no difference between the major parties about the need for it. We just do it better than you do and the community recognises that in the ballot box, and you resent that idea. Nonetheless, there is a congruence of perspective about end outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let it just for this moment be recorded that, if you are opposing this bill, neutering this bill or trying to reject this bill, then you are saying clearly to Australian industry, `In the world competitive market, you have to fight with one arm tied behind your back.' I do not think any Australian wants to see that occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition senators have recognised the fundamental importance of this bill&mdash;the substantial gains in prospect for the economy as a whole and the substantial gains in prospect for ordinary Australians. As I have said, that goes to more jobs, higher wages, lower inflation and an improved fiscal position for the governments in the states as well as for the Commonwealth. This bill has been subject to one of the most exhaustive public consultation processes ever. No-one can say that what lies before the Senate chamber tonight has not been through the mill at all levels of consultation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A public inquiry that was conducted by the distinguished Professor Fred Hilmer&mdash;the report bears his name&mdash;lasted for over a year. There was the release for comment of the exposure draft of the bill and the intergovernmental agreements last September, which attracted over 70 submissions in all. There have been numerous individual approaches by interested parties to Commonwealth and state ministers. This issue has now been centre stage for comment and debate within the Australian polity for well over a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that the package now has widened community support because of the consultation. Every state and territory government, consumer groups and the business community broadly endorse and support the package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have opposed the bill have not been able to sustain their criticisms. That is an important point. There is an obligation of rigour. Certainly criticisms are welcomed, but criticisms are tested to see whether they can be sustained. In this case, they have not been, and they have failed the test of rigour. Basically, this reflects a lack of understanding about what the bill itself does do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also reflects baseless fears about what the bill might do. It does not attack, as has been suggested in this debate, our humanity, for example, or community service obligations, as has also been inferred and suggested. That is a matter that governments will decide individually, as they do now. So this bill does not seek to change those arrangements. It was for each of the state governments as well as this government to decide what the right balance of community service obligations might be and for the democratic process to inform their decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flowing from all this are those who would want the bill to do what it was never intended to do and what it is not appropriate that it do. That is an important consideration leading into the committee stage here. We cannot hang off this bill other pieces of legislation that are not appropriate to its purpose and to try to reconfigure this bill to make it do things that it was never intended to do. I suggest with the greatest respect to honourable senators who intend to move them that some of the amendments are of that character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill cannot be used as a vehicle to promote, for example, environmental objectives above other objectives of the bill. The bill is not the appropriate vehicle for separate proposals that will be set in a broader policy context. The bill is not a vehicle in itself to promote the interests of, for example, small business. The bill is to ensure that there is genuine competition which creates an efficiency from which small business can benefit. It is not a small business policy piece of legislation in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, this bill represents the result of wide consultation, unprecedented agreement between the Commonwealth and state governments and the prospect of delivering significant reforms to benefit customers, businesses and the Australian economy as a whole. With those words, I commend this bill to the Senate and wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall do that. In doing so, I will indicate to the committee that there are two aspects to the amendment. I would like to address what is listed on the running sheet in Senator Kernot's name as amendment (3). In particular, I draw the minister's attention to part (a)&mdash;the imposing or collecting of taxes, levies or fees for licences. I do that, hoping that the minister is paying attention, because I want to indicate that they are legitimate activities of local government which are not included in the `definition of government business' that the government has moved as part of its amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would be very interested to hear the minister's justification for not accepting at least part (a) for inclusion, even if it was included in the government's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice to Senator Bell is that we have already covered what he is trying to do by the provision we have put in headed `Exemption of certain activities of local government bodies from Part IV'. If you have a copy of the amendments that appear under the government's name, as circulated in the chamber, Senator Bell, you will see that they read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2D.(1) Part IV does not apply to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)the refusal to grant or the granting, suspension or variation of, licences (whether or not they are subject to conditions), or by a local government body; or</PARA>

<PARA>It goes on to define the meanings of licences and local government bodies in this section. In short, I am saying that the amendments that appear under Senator Kernot's name&mdash;the ones to which you have just referred&mdash;are amendments with which we have, in principle, no difference. The issue is: what is the best way of expressing that objective? It is the government's belief that the drafting officers who have prepared our amendments have done so more effectively, but they do not in any way contradict or try to deviate from the same principle that Senator Kernot is trying to implement. We do think that Senator Kernot's amendments, with the greatest respect to her, are not as sharp in their drafting as ours. For that reason, we prefer our own. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, you may be advised of that, but I am advised by those who would be affected by this&mdash;that is, the Australian Local Government Association&mdash;that your amendments are just a little too sharp in that they do not include taxes, levies or fees for licences. They include the licences but not the taxes, levies or fees. I am advised of this in the full knowledge that the Local Government Association has attempted to point this out to the government and has had its requests ignored and is not convinced by the amendments that have been promoted by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received correspondence from the Australian Local Government Association. I do not apologise for reading to the committee the content of the argument, because I think that if I do that at least it will make it plain and clear what it is that local government expects from this bill and how it has been disadvantaged, at least to the association's knowledge. In relation to clause 76 of the bill, the Australian Local Government Association refers to the proposed addition of the words `imposing or collecting taxes, levies or fees for licences' to the definition of activities exempt from part IV. The minister will note that that is precisely what is before us under Senator Kernot's name. The Local Government Association tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will place Local Government on the same footing as the States/Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to Part IV of the TPA will open up all Local Government activities which could be construed as "business" to possible litigation under the competitive conduct provisions. However, the Act contains no definition of business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States/Territories considered it necessary to make it clear that activities associated with imposing taxes and levies and licensing are not to be considered "business" and the Commonwealth agreed. Hence the provisions of 2C(1)(a) and (b).</PARA>
<PARA>The advice from the Local Government Association to us reads further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Government is in exactly the same position as States/Territories. Councils issue a wide range of licences (shops, advertising, use of public places, building and planning approvals etc) for which fees are charged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Government also imposes and collects taxes or levies in its own right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Past experience and ALGA's legal advice points strongly to the potential for aggrieved applicants for licences to use the new TPA to argue that the Council's behaviour was anti-competitive in that excessive costs or conditions were imposed or a licence was refused. Similar arguments might be applied to the imposition of local rates or levies (eg development contributions for open space).</PARA>
<PARA>I will add my own example to that&mdash;one which Senator Gibson may appreciate. It concerns a levy for the Hobart Central Heart Association. It fits into precisely that sort of definition. I continue with the advice I have received from the Australian Local Government Association, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such litigation could be extremely costly, lead to unwarranted delays and frustrate proper government. No doubt the States were motivated by similar concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the current wording remains, it would appear to a potential litigant that the Parliament intended the granting etc of a licence by Local Government to be exempt, but not the charging of a fee for that licence. This is plainly untenable.</PARA>
<PARA>I think those words are quite clear, and I will continue with similarly clear objection with regard to the proposed protection of local government against prosecution and pecuniary penalties. The document reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Government is currently effectively exempt from the provisions of Part IV by virtue of the `Rockdale' case, which indicated that general-purpose Councils would rarely if ever be classed as financial or trading corporations. Hence Councils would not at present be liable to prosecution and pecuniary penalties under the TPA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This protection is comparable to the shield of the Crown and reflects the fact that Councils are government entities, not business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Councils are not equivalent to State authorities established primarily to undertake business activities. They are equivalent to central government departments.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Local Government Association therefore argued that the primarily governmental activities of councils should continue to be protected against prosecution and pecuniary penalties in the same way as the crown in right of a state or territory. We should note that the protection being granted to the crown does not include some business activities. The proposed amendment would not extend to identifiable local government business enterprises, as they are excluded from the definition of `local government body' in proposed section 2D(2). This is again directly comparable to the position in respect of states and territories. The advice concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Councils should not be exposed to the potentially large costs involved in defending prosecutions and payment of fines. These would simply amount to a further tax on local communities and an unwarranted intergovernment payment. Other sanctions are available to ensure that Councils meet their obligations under the new legislation, including direct intervention by the State/Territory Governments. Local Government's competitive conduct will be ensured by rules adopted by the State/Territory Governments pursuant to the Competition Principles Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>That concludes the advice. I find that perfectly plain and clear. I cannot see why what you are proposing should not include the definition at least of part (a) of the proposed amendment under Senator Kernot's name, because that was, of course, provoked directly by the advice that we received from the association. </PARA>

A community sector, which I might add, has annual budgets in the billions of dollars if we take into account the churches and other community players in that sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;History. In the face of no perceived or heard objection from the major parties, I think that obscurity is perhaps where they would like it to go. I want to insist that the implications are recognised. The minister introduced this section of the debate by telling us that there was a weight that must be recognised behind the agreement that had been reached by the state governments and the federal government; and that this was being brought into this place for endorsement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am getting a little tired of executive government's actions, of COAGulation's actions and of some ministerial councils' actions being brought before us for endorsement&mdash;not for challenge, consideration, debate or amendment. I would like to ensure that the Australian people are aware of how far into the realms of sophistry the real debates have been taken. If we had debates in the 1950s and 1960s about faceless men governing Australia, surely we ought to look now at how far away from real debate we have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Food Authority was mentioned by Senator Harradine. I recoil from my memories of that because that authority brought about the lowest common denominator in the levels of food authorities in Australia. I also recoil when I remember what happened during a debate, in which the minister in the chamber participated to some extent, about the National Registration Authority. The federal government had reached agreement with state governments about chemical residues and how things ought to be monitored. It was about agricultural and veterinary chemicals. It was all hunky-dory and we had to pass the legislation without amendment because, if we did not, it would all fall in a heap, state governments would demand that it all be taken back again&mdash;and this neat little deal could not possibly be challenged by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was sucked in; I believed that. Although there were some protestations from the Democrats, that legislation went through. Two years later we had to amend it because none of the state governments had come to the party. They had all worked out that it was a little suspect and that it did not need to be followed through. I am never convinced by these arguments that there is a weight behind the agreements reached by the Commonwealth government and state governments. Far too often we see examples of where the cosy deals suit the administration of government, but not the people of the states of Australia; and certainly not the other bodies that are affected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are right, Senator Harradine. Far too often, even ministers and elected members who are supposed to be putting the point of view of the people have been hoodwinked by deals which have been stitched up by the bureaucrats. I am reminded of a particularly famous example in Tasmania involving the Tasmanian Government Insurance Office, one of the few qangos that paid any sort of dividend to the Tasmanian people. Year after year, a couple of million dollars came back to the Tasmanian people. It was sold for peanuts to some foreign body and the Tasmanian population now pays through the nose for its insurance. Only last week we heard that teachers are not covered by workers compensation insurance or by any other insurance when travelling on school excursions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the result? Do the people of Tasmania benefit? Do the kids of Tasmania benefit? Does the community of Tasmania benefit? No. Eventually there will be no school excursions or interschool competitions because the staff will not be able to take the personal risk of being involved in accidents. Where in those economic rationalist driven figures are those community activities recorded? Nowhere. The events do not happen. The community is the poorer, but it cannot be calculated. No-one ever wrote that one down. It just means that life is not so rich anymore. How do we measure that? We cannot. The economic rationalists have not invented an index for that one yet. I do not think they ever will because they do not have the nous to see what it is to be alive. It is just a question of graphs and numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues may seem slightly irrelevant, but I see this as one final opportunity to put in an envelope and present to the minister exactly what is upsetting people about this cosy deal that has been arranged by some of the representatives of the Australian people but not all. Those who are concerned about this are starting to realise what qualities of life will be compromised by these theories. That is all they are; they are theories. The minister cannot demonstrate to me how the figure of $1,500 that he quoted to me as the benefit to each individual in Australia will arrive in my pocket. I am a person in Australia, and I will believe it when I see it. I make a bet with the minister: I think we will both be long dead before we get any of that money. I think it is a case of a figure being plucked out of the air, a figure which cannot be delivered and a promise which will be haunting those who endorsed this program for a long time to come. </PARA>

They relate to unconscionable conduct, and I am seeking to move these amendments to those sections in the bill which deal with the Trade Practices Commission amendments. By and large, small business has not been able to access unconscionable conduct as a remedy because of the way in which the unconscionable conduct provisions are drafted in the Trade Practices Act. That has been a matter of contention for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, in this very chamber during the last 24 hours, say that he attended a conference where this matter was discussed and that he gave an undertaking to small business that the government would attend to this matter by amending the conditions of unconscionable conduct so that, at long last, small business could get a fair deal. After Senator Schacht provided that information, I challenged him, saying, `On that basis, Minister, you would be supporting my amendments.' He seemed rather reluctant to commit himself to that, saying that a lot more work needed to be done before he could agree. I would have thought that the issue is fairly clear: either small business has access to this remedy or it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment I am moving adds a new subsection to Part IVA of the Trade Practices Act to provide that a corporation must not, in trade or commerce, engage in any conduct that amounts to economic duress within the meaning of the unwritten law of the states and territories. I am advised that that would do what the minister has suggested should be done. It is rather odd that the minister does not wish to take this opportunity to provide small business with that particular remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment relates to clause 13B and it seeks to provide an action for damages under section 51AA. It is an amendment to rectify what appears to have been a legislative oversight when amendments were made to the Trade Practices Act in 1992. It amends section 82 so that a person who suffers loss or damage by virtue of Part IVA&mdash;unconscionable conduct&mdash;may also take action to recover the amount of loss or damage caused by the contravention of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, section 82 of the Trade Practices Act provides that if conduct contravening Part IV causes loss or damage, those persons affected may recover the amount of that loss or damage by taking action against the person or persons involved in the contravention if it is with reference to restrictive trade practices or consumer protection. I believe it should also be available for damage suffered as a result of unconscionable conduct and I would call on the government and the opposition to support that particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment deals with Part IV and it seeks to insert into section 87(1B) a provision that allows representative actions to be taken on the basis that contraventions of Part IVA or Part V&mdash;that is consumer protection&mdash;have occurred and that damages would need to be obtained under that section. There would be many cases where individual consumers simply cannot afford to run actions on their own behalf. However, where many consumers are affected by unconscionable conduct or by contraventions of consumer protection legislation a representative action would provide justice for a lot of people.

This arises from a report prepared by a working party of the Small Business Forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that, while ministers will respond to departmental advice, I see a great deal of merit in what they say in the advice offered to me now. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have briefly examined the Democrat's proposal and, noting that there is no existing concept of economic duress within Australian common law, we believe it will not work. The provision as drafted is also technically flawed and potentially opens up legitimate business and business contracts to scrutiny of the courts.</PARA>
<PARA>With the greatest respect, the advice that I have before me is that, while the idea is correct, the drafting of the idea in the amendment before us opens more problems than it solves. The note goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Democrat proposal is unlikely to be effective, there are sound legal and economic policy reasons for the government to utilise the concept of economic duress to address small business concerns about business to business conduct. However, because the regulation of business conduct can impact on the competitive pressures of a market, an imprecise provision prohibiting certain activity can have significant adverse economic impact. The department is working closely with a range of business groups representing both large and small business to ensure that any response to the small business working party report both addresses small business concerns and does not provide significant distortions to the competitive operation of the market.</PARA>
<PARA>I read that into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to show that there is a strong body of advice coming to us in government to go down this track, but to do it with greater precision and accuracy. Therefore, for those reasons I do not support your amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also say that the report of the Small Business Forum that has focused on this issue is the subject of a working party and is being progressed. The government, in the context of responding to the working party report, is considering potential applicability of economic duress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) said the other day that his strong determination is to press ahead in this area and bring in the proper amendments; that the government is currently consulting with a range of business groups on this issue; and that we should offer to consult with the Australian Democrats about that as we continue down this course and get their response to the working party outcomes so that there can be, if you like, an effective remedy in this area. What I am saying in short is not that we oppose the concept; rather, we are actively involved with the small business community in trying to find the best way of implementing the principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a clear reading of what is before us now, firstly, it is not the appropriate way to amend the bill, in our view; and, secondly, the amendment as drafted does open up problems which we think ought not be opened up. With respect, it is not the most precise way of fixing this issue. It is for those reasons that we oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the minister and Senator Gibson have said, there is certainly an emerging consensus in Australia, particularly among small business, that this is an area that needs policy action. All of us know, from sitting through question time, that Senator Schacht, who is the minister currently responsible for small business, has made it quite clear that the government is committed to achieving progress in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a look at this matter, as Senator Spindler knows, only briefly. That is not to say that these matters have not crossed my mind. I have had a long, enduring interest in small business, from the day I left school and entered small business to the day I came into this place. I know from personal experience that there is a significant problem area in Australia between the perceived benefits of big businesses and, particularly, small business who see that in many circumstances they do suffer some duress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair to the minister and the government&mdash;and it is not very often that we seek to defend them or even be fair to them&mdash;I think it would be fascinating to create either a quasi-judicial tribunal, such as the Trade Practices Commission or another body, or some other judicial body such as a court, to determine exactly what unconscionable conduct might be in relation to someone who has suffered loss or damage as a result of some form of price fixing, for example. The minister has informed us that the term `economic duress' is not an area where there is any body of either statutory law, as you would call it, or common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that if we were to appoint you, Senator Spindler, when you retired from this place, and a couple of other people to some body that was to determine what economic duress was in relation to a number of business transactions, and you, as a commissioner, tried to determine what economic duress was case by case in relation to small businesses, the lawyers who would appear before you would all do very well, but the small businesses concerned, and possibly the consumers concerned, may not be the winners. So I, having just looked at this matter, and based on my own experience in small business, would say that the answer the minister has provided, supported on behalf of the coalition by Senator Gibson, is a sensible one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a multipartisan commitment in this chamber to addressing this area of policy, even though Senator Schacht keeps saying that we have no small business policy. I know this is an area of policy that our shadow minister and other ministers in finance related areas are looking at. It is an area that we think should be the subject of reform. It is a very genuine concern of the small business community and something that we take very seriously. But as the minister said, it is not the appropriate place or the appropriate time&mdash;and that sounds like Sir Humphrey talking. To almost omnibus this into the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 here tonight is not the best way to handle policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say, on behalf of the coalition as the spokesman on small business in the Senate, is that we are committed to looking closely at how you address this. It has enormous ramifications in terms of existing state legislation for things like trading regulations, trading hours and a whole range of other business law areas that cannot simply be waved away with the magic Democrat wand with a page and a half of amendments tonight. </PARA>

<PARA>This group of amendments should be uncontentious. I cannot understand why any senator here would not support them. The amendments seek to include public and community protection as an object of the act. They seek to have existing agreements between federal and state governments acknowledged and considered. They seek to explicitly include the issue that some ways of providing services have significant contingent benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I noted in my speech on the second reading, this bill is actually an empty vehicle, a vehicle of considerable power to change the face of Australian society. Senator Harradine has mentioned the concerns about the level of control that has been donated by us to perhaps faceless bureaucrats in this manner. It changes relations between levels of government, but is empty of content just the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act will have an objective. Clause 3 of this bill will insert the objective as section 2 of the principal act, the Trade Practices Act. It is this objective we are seeking to change with our amendment No. 1. The Trade Practices Act does not currently have an explicit objective. It is an act about trade practices. It is not a social agenda. We are turning it into a social agenda with an objective. We are creating a powerful and relatively autonomous body with a social reform objective and an unspecified agenda. It is crucial that in such a case we get the objective as near right as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Democrats have also proposed to amend this with their amendment No. 4. I note that our two amendments are compatible and move the objective in a similar direction. The objective of this act proposed in this bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of this Act is to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an assumption that promotion of competition will enhance the welfare of Australians. Is this so? It was not the case in the United Kingdom. Worse than that assumption is the directive that the object of the act is to enhance welfare `through' competition and fair trading. Any other method of enhancing welfare&mdash;cooperation, regulation and so on&mdash;will not be considered. In fact, a major objective of this act is to deregulate, to take away all those provisions made by society, mainly for its protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major objective is to privatise, to get rid of those public endeavours to enhance public welfare to create pressure for efficiency through competition. Our amendment here is minor. It has to be since we are given nothing but an almost empty shell. We seek to change the definition of the object of the act. We seek to extend the object beyond competition by changing it to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of this Act is to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for protection of the consumer and the community.</PARA>
<PARA>It is ironic that often the consumer is used to promote such changes, a la free market. If you ask those people involved with consumer protection, you will find that they are the most concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are proposing is not a big change, but it would give a bit of a different direction to the commission. The consumer protection part proposed by government seemed minimal, but it is the slight concession to community interests government seems willing to make. It is not enough. The consumer is only one of the parties that needs protection and consumer protection is liable to be interpreted as ensuring the lowest cost through dubious measures of economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a specific economic sense, the consumer is also part of the market transaction. It is assumed that by allowing consumers choice they are protected and they will make free and unencumbered choice based on enlightened self-interest. Economics also notes what are called externalities. This is where the results of a market transaction affect parties outside the transaction and where the effects are negative. There will be no reason for those in the transaction to consider them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of this is a bartender selling drinks to a customer. The bartender may decide that the customer is not drunk enough to cause a problem in the pub, so she or he sells the customer another drink. The customer is happy, but on the way home the customer runs over a child. The death is related to the sale of the drink, but is external to the transaction. It is an externality. In the same way, when a British coal fired power plant sells power to a town, the acid rain that kills rivers and lakes in Norway is an externality. It never enters into the transaction in Britain and people go on buying and selling as if Norway did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumer protection can also be seen in a narrow way in the health example. If the hospital is understaffed and has huge waiting times even though there are empty beds, the establishment of a private hospital protects the consumer. It is assumed that if people do not like waiting they can go to the private hospital. If they do not, they have made the free choice to wait. In all this economic language, the interest of the public&mdash;the fact that people may not have that much money and the fact that there may be community ethic&mdash;gets lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The community ethic may say that we should have decent health available to all without excessive waiting times. That will be lost in competition policy. The interest of the non-consumers who feel the impact of consumption&mdash;the externalities&mdash;will also be lost. The interests that would be otherwise lost under the proposed definition need to be considered. Our amendment says that the commission must consider and protect the community not just the consumer. This is the least we should include in an objective for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 13 seeks to ensure that all the hard work&mdash;work done in the public sector in developing flexible, responsible and responsive community service provision&mdash;is not simply thrown away. It will protect and have the commission recognise agreements made expressly in the interests of the public between federal, state and local government. It recognises agreements made over many years with a wealth of experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition is not only the objective of this act but it also becomes the underlying objective of society with all other agreements assessed in the light of their potential competition impact. All other values become subject to the supreme value of competition. This is not acceptable. Agreements like the water resources policy were made for explicit goals outside the formal economic framework and outside considerations of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are strong reasons for such an agreement and that is why the federal and state governments all agreed to the establishment of the Council of Australian Governments. There are other similar agreements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government put up amendments to extend the claim that competition policy is the only issue. In its own amendments&mdash;Nos 13, 14 and 15&mdash;the government sought to establish that the only criteria by which any party, minister, commission or council can make an agreement is by a competition principles agreement. None of them is allowed to consider wider impacts unless those concerns are included here or in the agreement. The pertinent section of the government amendments reads:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)must not consider any other matters.</PARA>
<PARA>These are indefensible amendments designed to exclude social and environmental considerations of existing agreements that might be in conflict with so-called pure competition.

<PARA>I will be speaking to the more extensive amendments in amendment No. 2. They are definitions and some effective changes to be included mainly in the intergovernmental agreements. Amendment No. 11 puts some similar definitions in the principal act where it was necessary for other amendments. Amendment No. 12 makes a very short addition to the definition of `service' in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition policy, with its intergovernmental agreements, forms a basis for action unprecedented in Australian history. As we noted in relation to our last group of amendments, the commission, council and minister are being asked, not legislatively ordered, in compelling terms to consider in their deliberations the agreements in only the competition principles agreement. It is therefore these measures which give initial direction to the bodies which we are now establishing. The Greens (WA) believe that it is imperative we send some message embodying some indication that a narrow economic focus is not the basis we want for all future decisions to be made upon. We have attempted to embody some other consideration in the definitions included in the draft agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 2 includes a definition of `efficient resource allocation'. In economic jargon, this often means that resources are available at the cheapest price or that they are available in the market, with the assumption that Adam Smith's famous invisible hand will automatically allocate resources efficiently as long as people can trade freely. This ignores the fact that choice is not the only factor at play. There are also necessity and market dominance. The analogy of a 17th century market where most people are effectively self-sufficient and trade in surplus goods is not a good analogy for today's economic sphere. Companies with more profit than many nations have gross domestic products can use their power to maximise return. People who must buy have choice available only at the prices offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are alternative definitions. Some believe that efficient resource allocation means the most socially beneficial and most sustainable allocation of physically scarce resources. This judges efficiency in terms of outcome, in terms of net social benefit weighed against net social cost, including environmental costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of this term is of particular concern in relation to plans to privatise utilities. We seek basic protection for the growing recognition that conservation and technical efficiency are often better methods of providing power, water and other necessities at least cost and with the least negative impact on the environment and society. It seeks to embody the fact that while private utilities can go broke, sell up and move away&mdash;and end up increasing charges due to poor management&mdash;the interests of the community are served best by providing a service that takes a long range perspective and recognises that it is society that pays the cost of mismanagement and loss of efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Utilities do not mind this kind of inefficiency, at least in the medium term, because they are in the business of selling power and water. It does not matter to them how much those things are used and inefficiency may increase sales. This is no longer an adequate approach and society has regulated to prevent exactly this kind of short-term, profit-centred gain to a few individuals in the unbridled competition that this is likely to lead to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why competition was bridled in the first place. It is a horse, a vehicle to get us somewhere; but there must be controls to ensure we can direct it&mdash;and there must be some kind of direction provided by an agent other than a horse. If we want a sustainable, just community which provides for all of its members, there have to be clear goals and controls. Otherwise, how do we know when we have reached them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second definition that we have included is that of least cost. This might seem simple to some people but, obviously, it is lost on a lot of people, especially those in government. The definition is crucial, because one based purely on bottom-line figures will never take in the wider range of values and goals we have for society. We are creating a vehicle that will largely dictate the society we will have. It is a partisan organisation pursuing goals and objectives. We need to ensure that those objectives are those of the community and of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those objectives are not always framed in dry, technical terms. They are often not capable of being framed in such terms but are able to be expressed and described; and we should be able to pursue them. The sense of least cost that we are defining explicitly considers long range costs and opportunity costs. Those costs which result from using resources one way instead of another are also considered. The cost to one industry of the actions of another is also considered. These are not normal market transactions but could be calculated on a balance sheet as costs to the community and to society; as costs to one sector of the economy due to actions of another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our definition of cost goes beyond economic costs and includes such costs as the depletion or degradation of resources. This is important. It includes non-pecuniary costs such as the loss of amenity, the loss of access to services, the loss of quality of life&mdash;and I mean quality rather than the level of consumption&mdash;and the cost to future generations. It means costs such as despair, emptiness and the feeling that life is getting worse and not better. It includes the cost to our children, the cost to our sense of the community and the cost of restrictions in the ability to pursue values, including through legislative or regulatory means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of regulations in law is not evidence of the meddling of politicians; it is evidence that people want to pursue their values. We are not suggesting that no decision should ever be made. We are suggesting that, if a body is set up to reduce and take apart regulations, to inhibit regulations, to inhibit the ability of the community and to pursue its interests&mdash;be they one price for all on electricity or whatever&mdash;it must consider all costs. We are saying that, if this body will review laws and regulations in the interests of society, it must take the interests of society into account. When the cost is considered, it must go beyond simple bottom-line figures and even more complex economic calculations and address the broad range of interests. All costs must be considered and judgments made on the basis of the best result in relation to these costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we define public interest or public benefit. This follows through with the other definitions and says that it is not up to the Industry Commission to say that the public will benefit from increased gross domestic product, even if the increase is gained by higher charges, reduced access, social upheaval or dislocation. It is ultimately up to the community to determine what it needs and wants. Amendments 2(b) and 2(d) extend into the agreement itself to embody the recognition of relevant agreements already made between governments, usually with a lot more public consultation than this measure. Agreements like the water resources policy reflect the wants and needs of the community and the public interest and should be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amendment 2(c) seeks to provide explicit consideration of public and environmental effects of prices and changes to prices. It is important to extend this, since it is easy for economists to consider punitive benefits to the economy and attribute benefits to the community without considering the actual mechanisms or impacts of a change in price. For example, a reduction in business costs in power with a small increase for domestic consumers may be seen as negating the impact of large increases on rural users. There may be many social and environmental ramifications of such a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 2(e) seeks to assure that the public has strong input into the process of breaking down public monopolies. Many have social functions well beyond the apparent economic ones, and the nature and importance of these must be identified. Amendment 2(f) seeks to extend the very limited perspective to include a far broader range of considerations. This is essential in many public monopolies that have functions which include environmental management. Amendment 2(g) replaces a subclause which demands that only the merits of privatisation and fragmentation of utilities be considered. We believe it is more appropriate to consider both benefits and costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 2(h) is an insertion of the two sections into requirements for a review of proposals to reform public monopolies. It seeks specifically to ensure consideration of sustainability and to assure that there will at least be consideration of the option of a flat charge rate or levy which means that all people have access to a service at the same cost. Amendment 2(i) tries to make explicit some of the issues consumers have about practices which they feel result in higher prices for them. All in all, it seeks that people know and understand what they mean by these considerations. When we talk about such things as least cost, we seek to make sure that people understand that least cost can mean real least cost, not just least cost for some. </PARA>

When they do agree, there is great force behind that agreement. What causes them to agree usually is a matter of great moment. That is the case here. Competition policy is a matter of considerable moment offering greater efficiencies to the community and greater competitiveness to Australian industry. </PARA>

However, we are here, we are debating it and we are being asked to ratify it. We have a great deal of sympathy with the points that have been made previously by Senator Margetts and Senator Harradine about the growing trend to go outside government.

Unless we can split parts one and two of the amendment, I would need to vote against it. But as it is going to be lost, we probably do not need to waste the time of the committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asking what is estimated to be the contingent liability of the Commonwealth as a result of this particular clause?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But I am looking ahead. Consider the case where a state government privatises a particular road and there is a payment made by an entrepreneur for that road. What is envisaged under this legislation is that that infrastructure comes within the scope of this legislation and a particular user may demand access to that road. The private entrepreneur could say, `You will have to pay commercial rates'. Those rates will be determined on the basis of the usual guidelines that determine commercial rates. The user objects and says that he is denied use of the road and takes the matter to the Competition Commission. What will the Competition Commission do in those circumstances? The Competition Commission might say, `Yes, maybe the private owner of that road has a point'. The Competition Commission might agree that what the owner has said about commercial rates being applied for the use of that road are just rates. But those rates are impossible for the user. In other words, the user should have been able to expect to use that road without having to pay these commercial rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, can the competition commission say that these roads normally would be subsidised roads; it is subsidised infrastructure; therefore, the user should not have to pay commercial rates? Under those circumstances, the infrastructure owner would have a claim against the commission. Under this provision there could be a claim on the Commonwealth or the state, whoever previously owned the road. Is this provision likely to mean that there will be substantial moneys awarded in respect of the acquisition of property, as I indicated, or is it envisaged that commercial rates will apply for access?</PARA>

There will also be an obligation for the state governments to consider what the community service obligation might be. If it were to privatise, how does it meet that type of criteria for the privatised item of infrastructure? Obviously, anyone who purchases it does so against a knowledge of the conditions of this bill. By doing so against the knowledge of the provisions of this bill, it seems to me that there is no claim of compensation for them if they believe that somehow or other, by their ownership, the property has been reduced in value. </PARA>

<PARA>I do need to speak to these amendments, so I will make a start. On amendment No. 2, I make the point that this is an amendment that the ACTU originally raised with the government. We have had a look at it because we think it makes a couple of important points. It seeks to broaden the exemptions on what constitutes government business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is important because anything which does not fall within this exemption will, by virtue of this bill, be expected to move to a competitive neutrality basis, and that means it will be open to competition. Competitive neutrality, the way it is defined, will, in our view, hamstring public sector organisations. As I said in the second reading debate, public sector organisations will be expected to assume the same full cost basis as the private sector, with the same rates of imputed taxation and the same imputed cost of finance and no advantage from any so-called anti-competitive regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, public sector agencies will still be expected to be accountable for their decisions&mdash;politically, through the parliament; financially, through the Auditor-General; and, legally, through the administrative tribunals. As we have seen in this place, accountability comes at a significant cost, and this is a cost which the public sector has to meet in a democracy, but which the private sector largely does not have to meet, other than a limited accountability to shareholders for performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So competitive neutrality really does have the capacity to hamstring the public sector, and that is why I think it is important that we seek to ensure that the exempt activities cover as many of the vital core pieces of government where accountability is a vital and necessary component. This amendment seeks to exclude from activities which can be deemed to constitute a business service in education, health, welfare, community support and labour market assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), in his second reading speech, sought to assure public sector unions and workers that competition policy would not mean wholesale dismantling of the public sector because, he said, competitive neutrality would only apply to significant business activities. What does that mean? What does `significant business activities' mean?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say that in sectors such as health and education competition would be limited to enterprises engaged in a business activity, which might be a small part of their overall role or ancillary to their core activities. Maybe the Assistant Treasurer is right. I do not think&mdash;and I think Senator Margetts has already alluded to this&mdash;in this brave new world we are launching into that we should underestimate the pressure that governments will come under to allow the private sector into a whole range of activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One private sector submission to the Industry Commission contracting out inquiry argues that the core business of government covers only policy formulation and analysis. Everything else, the submission argues, is ancillary and capable of being competitive and being contracted out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee tabled its first report in relation to soccer. Contained therein was a dissenting report. Senator Carr spoke to it earlier today. I felt compelled to make some response to the comments made by Senator Carr at the time of the tabling of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that one of the fundamental rules of soccer is that you play the ball and not the opponent. Senator Carr's attack on the integrity of the committee is such that a red card should have been shown to him and he should have been sent off. Indeed, I have never seen or witnessed a person so offside on so many occasions as Senator Carr in relation to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I defend the integrity of the committee on which I had the privilege to serve. Senator Coulter, as chairman of that committee, dealt with absolute proprietary, as I would suggest did the other members. The committee had its genesis in the allegations circulating within the media, which then led to the Australian Soccer Federation establishing the Stewart inquiry. Justice Stewart's so-called findings then became known as the Stewart report. That report was leaking everywhere. As a result, a lot of people became concerned that only elements of it were being leaked and allowed into the hands of the media, whereas other parts were not. There was concern within the soccer community as to whether or not the whole truth was being revealed or whether the public was being subjected to subjective leaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People's reputations had already been maligned prior to this committee embarking upon its inquiry. For Senator Carr to suggest that that is what the committee did&mdash;namely, malign people&mdash;is, to say the least, disingenuous and flies in the face of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also noteworthy&mdash;it is shown in the front of the report&mdash;that Senator Carr did not serve on this committee for the first four months of its operations and Senator Wheelwright, who joined in the dissenting report, was only a member of the committee for one month. So they cannot approach this topic with any degree of expertise or knowledge as to what the committee did throughout its duration. Indeed, the only Labor senator who was there for the duration was Senator Margaret Reynolds. I note that she has not made any comments. I am disappointed that she lent her name to the minority report because I believe it is out of character with her usual style of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this chamber know that Senator Carr becomes vitriolic when cornered. His ferocious attack on the integrity of the committee has no real basis in logic. It may have been foundered on his concern at what we might discover. Senator Carr headed his minority report `In defence of civil liberties'. I am still waiting to hear from the left faction leader, Senator Carr, about his writings on the defence of civil liberties in the old communist bloc countries. There has been not a squeak out of him and it sounds very hollow that he should now try to start building a reputation on civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am astounded by Senator Carr's comments. Other members of the committee will confirm this&mdash;and I have to be careful that I do not divulge what happened in the private meetings of the committee: I can assure this Senate that I was one who absolutely ulcerated over whether or not the Stewart report ought be released under Senate privilege. Senator Ferguson nods his head in agreement confirming that. I can assure this Senate that I was very concerned about the implications for people and their civil liberties. That was at the forefront of my mind. However, I was persuaded on balance, given all the leaks that had occurred, that this needed a complete and open airing such as has been given by the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot comment on what happened at the private meeting about whether or not the Stewart report ought be released, but let me simply say that I gave that matter a great degree of attention. My initial thought&mdash;when I was advised that I would have to consider it&mdash;was against releasing the report. But, on balance, I was persuaded to alter my state of mind in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to two sections of the dissenting report to which I take quite considerable umbrage. I refer to paragraph 1.6, in which Senator Carr and his colleagues state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the course of the Committee's inquiry, the civil liberties of individuals were trampled on by a gross abuse of the processes of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carr is very fortunate that he did not try to identify those that he alleges were responsible for this alleged trampling. I believe that a lot of people were allowed to put on record their genuine concerns about soccer in a situation where they did not have to fear the possibility of defamation proceedings. I realise that that has difficulties in that people can make unsubstantiated allegations and are clothed with privilege in doing so. But I believe that, in general terms, the committee and the witnesses that appeared before it were genuinely concerned about soccer and its future direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 1.7 is grossly offensive. I should indicate to the Senate that we on the committee were not given the courtesy of being allowed to read the minority report prior to it going to the printers. Therefore, we were not aware of its contents. Paragraph 1.7 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition sought to sensationalise the inquiry in the media by encouraging witnesses to come forward and present unfounded allegations and malicious hearsay as evidence . . .</PARA>
<PARA>To make the assertion that any single one of my colleagues on that committee sought to try to get people to the committee hearings to present unfounded allegations and malicious hearsay is a reflection that defies any basis in logic. Indeed, it imputes a grossly improper motive on my colleagues and me, and indeed on Senator Coulter who chaired this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that we were actively encouraging people to make unfounded allegations and to make malicious hearsay assertions just cannot be sustained in any shape or form. The only quote that is put into this report in support of that outrageous assertion and allegation is Senator Carr quoting himself. What a dynamic piece of evidence to support an argument! It was just self-serving nonsense about a drunk driver who allegedly knocked somebody over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have to wonder about the state of sobriety of Senator Carr when he wrote such an outrageous allegation. I completely reject it. I know that my colleagues do. I do not think Senator Carr has served himself or, indeed, the committee process well by his outrageous activities in relation to the dissenting report on this soccer inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rarely rise to speak in the adjournment debate, but I felt compelled to do so this evening. I wish to speak on exactly the same matter as Senator Abetz. I commend him for the comments he made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today saw the tabling of the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Soccer: A first report</EMPHASIS>. I think it is important that we realise this is a first report. Although it was not highlighted today, the reason it is the first report is that we determined we would put down a report prior to the finish of this session of parliament, purely in order to help the Australian Soccer Federation. The federation had some decisions it wanted to make and we promised it that we would have a report down by the end of this session of parliament although there were many matters that were still under consideration. Certainly, all those people who had been adversely commented on in evidence have not had a chance to reply. I anticipate that at some stage in the future the committee will be hearing from many of these people. What actions will need to be taken once that happens remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did make some comments in the short time available this afternoon. It was a short time because of the restriction of time that now applies to the tabling of committee reports. Invariably that means that one government senator, one Democrat senator and one Liberal senator can speak, and that is it. I was courteously given some three or four minutes and I may repeat some things I said this afternoon, but I think it is absolutely important that what I have to say is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start by dissociating myself completely from the comments by Senator Kim Carr this afternoon. I would describe him as, and he has proven to be, an inquiry wrecker. I believe that the minority report, which I gather was formulated by Senator Carr but signed by other government members on the inquiry, was an outrageous attack on a committee that has at all times tried to act with the utmost propriety. From the time Senator Carr became a member of the soccer inquiry, he has sought to do nothing but destroy the workings of the committee by taking sensational stands and seeking to publicise himself for political ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr also appears to have defied the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, who stated that the government would cooperate with the inquiry and not stand in its way. This was said at the time the terms of reference were first put to the Senate, when matters had been aired, the Stewart inquiry report had been brought down and many people were very concerned about the state of soccer and the direction things were going. There were also hints of corruption in that sport. Senator Faulkner himself said that the government would cooperate with the inquiry and not stand in its way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr in his report has accused the committee of sensationalising the inquiry by encouraging witnesses to come forward to present unfounded allegations and hearsay as evidence. Nothing could be further from the truth. At every stage, the committee conducted itself with propriety and I resent the implications contained in Senator Carr's minority report. In fact, it is a matter of regret for the majority of the committee that potential witnesses, particularly soccer players who had previously provided information in many cases to the media, did not come before the committee to repeat those assertions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Carr had bothered to regularly attend committee meetings and public hearings and to keep an open mind, he might have been able to contribute something to the benefit of soccer. But he did not even have the courtesy to attend the final meetings where we discussed the content of the committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Instead, Senator Carr assumed the role of the wrecker and did not make one contribution to the final report, which is in the best interests of the people we are trying to help&mdash;that is, the entire soccer community of Australia. My interest in this inquiry was to make sure that the thousands of Australians who play this sport could do so without fear or favour, under a sound administration and in the knowledge that there was no hint of corruption anywhere within the sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I am not totally convinced that there is no hint of corruption, but I hope that this report will help the federation in its efforts to make sure that soccer in Australia is in a far better state than it was prior to the inquiry by Justice Stewart. It is a great pity that Senator Carr was unable to put aside his desire to wreck the workings of the committee and make a positive contribution to the development of soccer in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, all he has demonstrated is that he will do and say anything to try to discredit Senate inquiries, even those which his own minister has stated the government will cooperate with. It is obvious that Senator Carr does not have the slightest interest in the future of Australian soccer, and his minority report should be treated with the contempt that it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the minority report he has written is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In defence of civil liberties</EMPHASIS>. I wonder where on earth Senator Carr actually chose the title for his minority report. It would seem to me that by his actions he has done anything but defend the civil liberties of people involved. I am wondering whether it might not have been better called `Protect your mates', because I believe Senator Carr had no concern for soccer. His only concerns were politics, his political mates and people he knew were actually involved in the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that in the minority report there are a lot of quotes, most of which are Senator Carr's. If we take into account the number of days and hearings he attended and the number of times he actually spoke during those inquiries, the minority report probably has just about all the things he said during the inquiry in it. His only concern was to make sure that he stage managed a particular point of view that was well written up in the media so that the headlines could read `Victorian senator slams Senate committee', or words to that effect. I do not know if that is the exact headline, but it is very similar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the minority report there is actually a quote from Senator Wheelwright&mdash;and I do not want to criticise Senator Wheelwright. He attended only the last day of our inquiry. But Senator Carr chose to use a comment that Senator Wheelwright made at that meeting when he had very little to say. I do not think it is fair to criticise Senator Wheelwright, because he became a member of that committee only at a very late stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reynolds attended very few meetings&mdash;only two or three and then only for a short time. In the minority report we also find quotes from Mr David Hill&mdash;a very late appointment as Chairman of the Soccer Federation. I should say that the Soccer Federation itself welcomed the Senate inquiry, which enabled many people to clear their names from any innuendoes that may have been brought about by the publication of the Stewart report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to remember one thing. We want to remember that the Stewart report, which was the basis of this inquiry being called, was commissioned by the Australian Soccer Federation. The Senate had nothing to do with the Stewart report. The Senate certainly suggested in June 1994 that it did not believe that all was well in soccer and that an inquiry might be necessary, but it was felt that the Soccer Federation  should first have the option itself of trying to do something for its own sport&mdash;and that was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Stewart report was brought down we all know what happened. Some people leaked some of the contents of the Stewart report before the Soccer Federation had published it. The Senate then believed that, as a result of that, people needed an opportunity to clear their names. I believe we have done that. I think Senator Carr's unwarranted attack on the attitudes of the committee and its report does not do him any credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to comment on the fact that Senator Carr put in a minority report. I do not want to comment on the fact that he did; he is quite at liberty to put in a minority report. But I believe that there ought to be some courtesies observed in this place. When a minority report is written, having the full facts available in a majority report&mdash;where all the amendments are shown&mdash;I think it is only a common courtesy that a minority report should be shown to members of the committee prior to that report going to print. It is certainly a matter that I will be asking the Privileges Committee to take up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that I think that signifies just how Senator Carr felt about his report. He did not want anybody else to see what he was saying before it went to the printer. The first thing we knew about the contents of that report was when we received it some time after 4.00 p.m. today, which I think is disgraceful. I thought it was only right that I should put those feelings on the record. I thank you, Madam Deputy President, for your indulgence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to again draw the attention of the Senate to a race discrimination complaint lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by Canberra public servant John Bell against his then employer, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, on 4 March 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case received notoriety almost five years later in February 1995 when the full bench of the High Court upheld a constitutional challenge by one of the guilty parties, Mr Harry Brandy, against the powers of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to enforce the federal government's racial discrimination legislation. There is no doubt that this emasculation of the authority of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission can be attributed significantly to the efforts of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following Mr Brandy's attacks on Mr Bell in the workplace on 16 February 1990, Mr John Bell approached the then chief executive officer of ATSIC, Bill Gray, with a request for a handshake apology from Mr Brandy. When Mr Gray refused the request, Mr Bell was obliged to lodge a formal complaint against ATSIC with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the next 2 1/2 years, Mr Bell and HREOC made attempts to resolve the matter with ATSIC, but to no avail. A formal inquiry into the complaint was conducted under Mr Ron Castan QC in August 1992. Mr Castan had been legal counsel representing Eddie Mabo in the High Court Mabo land rights case; therefore, one would think that his credentials at this inquiry would stand detailed scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this inquiry, Mr Bell presented his own case without legal assistance because of the costs involved. Although Mr Bell won the case on 2 October 1992, ATSIC successfully had it reopened, causing Mr Bell to incur substantial legal costs. Several reconciliation meetings convened by HREOC followed, at which Commissioner Castan indicated there was a prime facie case against ATSIC. These matters drew little support as ATSIC refused to accept Mr Castan's advice. Subsequent to these hearings, Mr Castan brought down findings unfavourable to ATSIC on 2 October 1992, finding ATSIC guilty of breaching the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief executive of ATSIC Mr Peter Shergold was successful in having the matter reopened, despite the fact that ATSIC had been given every opportunity to resolve this racial matter before it went to a formal hearing. By 22 December 1993, nearly four years after Mr John Bell lodged his original complaint with HREOC, Ron Castan QC found that an Aboriginal officer of ATSIC, Harry Brandy, had on at least one occasion attacked Mr Bell in a racist and offensive manner in the ATSIC workplace. In a 60-page document, Mr Castan was critical of ATSIC management practices and the sworn evidence of several ATSIC senior managers, including the chief executive officer, a general division manager, branch heads and a number of section directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is history that Mr Harry Brandy, in a case funded by ATSIC through the Aboriginal Legal Service, was able to destroy the federal government's discrimination legislation. I have grave concerns that Mr Brandy's High Court action would not have occurred if Mr Gray from ATSIC had taken appropriate disciplinary action in February 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I take the opportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate that the innocent victim of this matter, Mr Bell, has suffered considerably during the last 5 1/2 years. During this period Mr Bell has been subject to extreme harassment and victimisation by elements within ATSIC, with the result that on 13 June he was forced to leave ATSIC and the Public Service after a 27-year career working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Mr Bell, a victim, has received no support from ATSIC, nor from the Public Service Commission through the Public Service Merit Protection and Review Agency. The actions by the Merit Protection and Review Agency in the Bell matter demonstrate that it is clearly unable to service the needs of its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC, throughout this case, made several unsuccessful attempts to discredit Mr Bell as being an individual of unsound mind. On each occasion these allegations could not be substantiated. Mr Bell, the complainant, was forbidden to enter ATSIC premises and to contact ATSIC staff. He was eventually arrested and placed in gaol at the instigation of ATSIC. Mr Bell made numerous attempts to resolve this matter, including a personal approach to the chief executive officer of ATSIC Ms Patricia Turner. At the end of the day ATSIC indicated that it would negotiate with Mr Bell only on the basis that he accept a redundancy package. I have advice that the chief executive officer of ATSIC Pat Turner advised the Racial Discrimination Commissioner that there was an element in ATSIC totally out to destroy Mr Bell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now must acknowledge that Mr Bell, the victim of racist allegations, has suffered ill health and has been financially destroyed by legal costs and litigation as a result of ATSIC failing to support his genuine concerns. His 27 years in the Public Service and in the Aboriginal community have been destroyed. At the end of the day, under considerable duress Mr Bell was forced to sign an agreement with ATSIC which terminated his services. Mr Bell's treatment in this whole affair as the victim raises serious questions concerning current workplace management practices in ATSIC and the Public Service. I think we also need to ask why neither Harry Brandy nor any ATSIC senior manager has ever been disciplined for proven breaches of the Public Service Act and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must acknowledge that at a farewell luncheon recently organised on behalf of Mr Bell by rank and file ATSIC staff, many of whom were Aboriginals, his service and dedication to the Aboriginal community were widely acknowledged. Tributes were received from eminent Aboriginal sporting identities, administrators, academics and the author Professor Colin Tatz. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that as a Senate there should be an obligation upon us to re-examine the circumstances which have befallen Mr Bell as a result of the claims which he made and which were legitimately proven to be correct. No individual who comes forward in honesty to report a matter of racial discrimination should suffer loss. The actions of ATSIC to date provide little comfort, and Mr Bell has received no justice whatsoever. </PARA>

My first involvement directly with him in committee work was on the ABC select committee.

The witness came before the committee and was asked whether he spoke to Senator Alston before the inquiry. He said he had never, in his life, spoken to Senator Alston. Quite incredibly, Senator Carr persisted. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record will show that I interjected, `Quit while you are behind, Senator Carr,' but he persisted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often have an opportunity to produce reports that are critical of the Australian government. Senator Carr came up with an approach where he was going to be critical of the Victorian government. When Labor had the majority on the committee, before the committee structure was changed, we had a situation where Senator Carr was quite prepared to set up an inquiry into Commonwealth-state relations with the intent of bagging the Kennett government and the Western Australian government in particular on their accountability for spending federal money. Unfortunately for him, that backfired. It showed, largely, that Commonwealth mechanisms are greatly deficient in accounting for the expenditure of public money. I felt it was an interesting irony that that is the way the report turned out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this disruption that has occurred over the last few months, we have managed to come up with a report that is almost unanimous on that inquiry. There were a few dissenting points from the Labor members of the committee on the Austudy report, which we have now completed and which will be tabled tomorrow.

It has fulfilled a longstanding pattern where Senator Carr has been extremely disruptive in a number of committees. We have yet again today from Senator Ferguson the example of how that has happened with the Senate soccer inquiry. We have had the previous example with the ABC committee. That particular final report was most outrageous because Senator Carr was not even prepared to look at the majority report.
