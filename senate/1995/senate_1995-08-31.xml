<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Petition to Senator Gareth Evans, to urge strong trade action against the French Government, in response to planned nuclear tests in the South Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the children of the Upper Mt. Gravatt Kindergarten think that you should not explode any bombs because it will hurt the animals, the environment, the people and could put cracks in the earth. We want to grow up in a safe, healthy bomb-free world, so, for the sake of all the children and our future, PLEASE THINK AGAIN.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the undersigned students and staff of Forster High School, believe that in making plans to undertake nuclear testing in the Pacific, the French Government is acting with a high degree of irresponsibility. The American Government, by endorsing French policy and undertaking its own nuclear testing is acting equally irresponsibly, if not more so. The actions of these two nations will not only threaten world security, but destroy millions of organisms and their habitats.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The staff at the Grampians Community Health Centre support the recent expression of concern and disapproval on the part of Australians over proposed French nuclear testing at Mururoa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The possible leakage from the test site of radioactive material would promote cancers and permanent genetic damage in present and future generations of human and all other life forms. The secrecy surrounding some hospitals in French Pacific colonies suggests that this has already happened locally. As health workers, we see the extensive and costly social problems produced even by remediable health impairment. Finally, it is well understood that the announcement and carrying out of tests damage the support for the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing actions in protest at the French decision, such as the disallowance of refuelling of French aircraft in Darwin, should be continued. Exportation of uranium to France should be ceased. It may be in Australia's interests to consider extending some form of aid to the Pacific nations currently dependent on French administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We urge you to continue efforts to facilitate a position by which the French government might reverse its decision without losing face, or even one by which it might gain in respect.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator the Hon John Faulkner, of 1 June 1995 concerning the Applied Laws (Implementation) (Amendment) Ordinances 1995 for the Territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I am replying, as this matter comes within my portfolio responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ordinances reinserted the Financial Institutions Duty Act 1983 (WA)(CI)(CKI) (the FID Acts) into the list of suspended laws in the Applied Laws (Implementation) Ordinances 1992 for both Territories. They had been inadvertently removed by the Applied Laws (Implementation) Ordinances 1994 for both Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ordinances were gazetted in April 1995 and were expressed to operate retrospectively from 1 January 1995. In effect, financial institutions duty became due and payable in that period. The Commonwealth has entered into an arrangement with the State Taxation Department of Western Australia to assess and collect taxes in the Indian Ocean Territories on behalf of the Commonwealth. However, the powers in the FID Acts, which are vested in the Minister in accordance with sections 8G of the Cocos (Keeling Island's, Act 1955 and the Christmas Island Act 1958, were not delegated to the WA Commissioner of Taxation to authorise the collection of the duty. As the administrative arrangements to collect the duty were not in place, no duty was collected.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted your advice that as the administrative arrangements to collect the duty were not in place, no duty was collected, and decided to remove the protective notice of disallowance on the ordinances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also noted, however, your advice that under the ordinances financial institutions duty became due and payable retrospectively and would be grateful for your confirmation that such prejudicially retrospective legislation is not void under the two parent Acts.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Determination No.2 of 1995 made under section 356 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 which was before the Committee at its meeting on 1 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Determination purports to revoke Determination No.1 of 1995 and determines Guidelines for the exercise of the Secretary's power under section 355 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee draws your attention to the fact that it did not receive copies of Determination No.1 to scrutinise. Further, although a notification of Determination No.1 dated 6 January 1995 was published in the Gazette on 9 January 1995, Determination No.1 does not appear to have been tabled in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. If Determination No.1 was not tabled, then, under the provisions of subsection 48(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, it would "cease to have effect" on the expiration of 15 sitting days from its commencement date which would have been 9 March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the Explanatory Statement for Determination No.2of 1995, the Department operated under Determination No.1 until it was revoked. If so, then the Department may have been acting without the authority of any Guidelines from 9 March 1995 until the commencement of Determination No.2 of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the instrument deals with the release of private information, the Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether the above matters as outlined are correct. If so, the Committee would also appreciate your advice as to whether any information was released in reliance on the Guidelines after the date of expiry and the legal consequence of releasing personal information without legal authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Determination No.2 of 1995 deals with the release of sensitive personal information the Committee would be grateful for your confirmation that the Privacy Commissioner was consulted during the process of developing the Guidelines.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 1 June 1995 concerning Determination No 2 of 1995 made under section 356 of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 which was considered by the Committee on that day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9 January 1995 Determination No 1 of 1995 was notified in the Gazette. It took effect from that day. My Department has informed me that, regrettably, no action taken between 31 January and 9 March 1995 (the next fifteen sitting days after the signing of that Determination) to table that Determination in both Houses of the Parliament in accordance with paragraph 48(1)(c) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of that breakdown in procedures within my Department that Determination was not scrutinised by the Committee, and it ceased to have effect, under subsection 48(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, on 10 March 1995. I regret that this has happened. I have been informed that procedures are now in place that should ensure that such a situation will not happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has informed me that information has been released between 10 March and 12 May 1995 (when Determination No 2 of 1995 took effect) in conformity with the Guidelines set under Determination No 1 of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has been advised that the absence of Ministerial guidelines under section 356 of the Act does not mean that there is no legal authority for the exercise of powers under section 355 of the Act during that absence. The provisions, in section 355 that refer to `guidelines from time to time in force' mean, according to that advice, that, if there are Ministerial guidelines, they must be observed but, if there happen to be no Ministerial guidelines, then the statutory power may continue to be exercised. In any event my Department acted as though the Ministerial guidelines were in force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has confirmed that both sets of guidelines were prepared in consultation with and cleared by staff of the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That instrument amends instrument No.99 of 1995 which determined a Statement of Principles relating to chronic myeloid leukaemia. The amendment replaces the word "acute" with the word "chronic" in clause 1(a). The Explanatory Statement notes that this amendment reflects the correct decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority. Instrument No.99 of 1995 was, however, part of the legal process reflecting that decision, and the decision was not accurately reflected in that instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be grateful for your confirmation that no person other than the Commonwealth has been prejudiced by the making of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instrument No.125 of 1995 made under section 196B(3) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 was also before the Committee at its above mentioned meeting. That instrument amends instrument No.6 of 1995 which determined a Statement of Principles relating to opisthorchiasis. The Committee raised the inconsistency of the spelling of the disease by letter dated 6 March 1995, and as a result, instrument No.125 of 1995 has corrected that spelling error. The Explanatory Statement, however, does not mention the role of the Committee in identifying the error.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you point out, Instrument No 126 amended Instrument 99 which was about `chronic myeloid leukaemia'. The inclusion of the word `acute' was inappropriate since both the Statement and the factor were talking of the `chronic' form, a different medical condition. There was already a Statement of Principles for `acute myeloid leukaemia', Instrument 35 of 1994. No disadvantage occurs to the sufferers of that condition since the same factor appears in that Instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I therefore give the Committee the assurance that no person has been prejudiced by the making of the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No.86, and the Sales Tax Procedure (Old Laws) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No.87. These instruments are presently before the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These two sets of rules make an almost identical amendment to the respective principal regulations. The following comments of the Committee, therefore, apply equally to both instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement for the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations (Amendment) states that the regulation in force prior to the making of the current amendment, regulation 18, "requires the Commissioner to certify [in the evidentiary certificate] that an assessment of sales tax payable by a person was made against the person in respect of the year set out in the certificate". This amending instrument, which removes the reference to a particular year from the Commissioner's certificate of assessment, is made retrospective to 16 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has considered the explanation for the amendment in the Explanatory Statement, being that as the Act does not refer to a year, the amendment is removing an inconsistency from regulation 18.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not unusual, however, for regulations to set out the details, manner and time frames within which fees, levies and charges or other imposts are to be collected or other matters complied with. That is, the delegated legislation sets out the details after the head legislation has set out the general principles. In order to be satisfied that regulation 18 is not, in fact, valid law, the Committee would be grateful for your advice as to the need to amend regulation 18.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would also appreciate advice as to whether there were any evidentiary certificates issued during this time, being 16 June 1994 to present, which did not mention the year and, if so, whether such certificates were used in any actions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 8 June 1995 concerning the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No. 86, and the Sales Tax Procedure (Old Law) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1995 No. 87. These statutory rules amend the regulations which specify the information which must be shown on evidentiary certificates for use by the Commissioner of Taxation in proceedings to recover unpaid sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statutory rules under consideration make identical changes to the Sales Tax Assessment Regulations and the Sales Tax Procedure (Old Law) Regulations. In each case the amendments remove the need for specifying the year in respect of which tax has been assessed in evidentiary certificates used by the Commissioner of Taxation in sales tax recovery proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You seek advice on the need for the amendments. You also seek advice as to whether any evidentiary certificates issued after 16 June 1994 (the date on which the requirement to include a reference to the year of assessment was included in the regulations) did not mention the year and, if so, whether such certificates were used in actions to recover unpaid sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first point to note is that the amendments operate retrospectively to correct an error made by amendments to the regulations which took effect on 16 June 1994. The two offending amendments were part of a package of changes which included the standardisation of evidentiary certificates for recovery of several kinds of taxes including sales tax. Part of the standardisation of certificates was a requirement that the evidentiary certificate should include the year in respect of which the assessment of tax was made against the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 and Sales Tax Assessment Act (No.1) 1930 (and other sales tax assessment Acts affecting dealings with goods before 1 January 1993) do not impose a liability to taxation in respect of a year or any other period. Accordingly, a regulation containing the requirement to specify, on sales tax evidentiary certificates, the year in respect of which an assessment was made is inconsistent with the principal Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given this inconsistency, the reference to `year' in sales tax regulations on evidentiary certificates could cause confusion amongst taxpayers, and the courts and tribunals that deal with sales tax matters. The amendments effected by SR86 and SR87 of 1995 are therefore necessary to remove the possibility of such confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 16 June 1994 the Commissioner has issued 6 evidentiary certificates in court proceedings to recover unpaid sales tax. Generally, the certificates are used in court in contested actions against individuals for recovery of unpaid sales tax. None of the 6 certificates specified a year in respect of which unpaid sales tax had accrued. The requirement to specify the year was disregarded because of uncertainty about the meaning of the requirement and because there is no power under the principal legislation to issue assessments for sales tax in respect of a particular year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust the above is of assistance to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>It gives me pleasure today to table on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the results of the committee's 338th report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accrual accounting&mdash;a cultural change</EMPHASIS>. This is the result of the committee's review of two reports presented to the parliament by the Auditor-General in 1994. Those reports were Auditor-General's report No. 32 of 1993-94 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency audit, accrual reporting&mdash;are agencies ready?</EMPHASIS> and Auditor-General's report No. 16 of 1994-95 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Follow-up audit, accrual reporting&mdash;are agencies ready?</EMPHASIS>. These audit reports contained an assessment of whether Commonwealth agencies were adequately prepared to meet their obligations to report on an accruals basis for the 1994-95 financial year. Prior to this, the majority of Commonwealth agencies had been reporting on a cash accounting basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accrual accounting has been with us for a long time and is the basis for accounting in the private sector and in government business enterprises. Accrual accounting recognises revenue and expenses in the accounting period in which they occur. This contrasts with cash accounting which records transactions when cash is exchanged. Accrual accounting therefore aims to match the costs incurred during a particular reporting period with the benefits earned in that same period. It also segregates capital transactions from operating transactions. It is a commonsense approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's interest in promoting accrual concepts has a long history. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 34, The Trust Fund</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in 1957, the committee argued that Commonwealth bodies operating on a trust account, rather than from the consolidated revenue fund, should keep a profit and loss account and a balance sheet which should be certified by the Auditor-General. Later, in 1982, the committee recommended that cash based accounting should be eliminated as the primary basis for financial reporting by Commonwealth authorities and, instead, that accrual accounting should be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also became clear in the committee's recent inquiry into the commercialisation of public sector operations that many Commonwealth agencies, particularly those which had moved to adopt a more commercial approach to program and service delivery, had found accrual reporting and accounting to be a valuable management tool. For this reason, the committee broadened its inquiry beyond the assessment of the readiness of Commonwealth agencies to produce reports on an accrual basis for this last financial year to the uses of accrual information&mdash;by the government, by agency managers and by external reviewers&mdash;to facilitate better judgments about operating performance, economic impact and the stewardship of public resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the review, the committee received evidence at public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, at which the experiences of agencies within the Commonwealth, Victorian and New South Wales jurisdictions were canvassed. As well, information was sought from other states and territories and from New Zealand, which has been at the forefront of introducing accrual accounting for government agencies in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report No. 338 considers at some length the uses to which the information in accrual reports can be put. In particular, information can be used to make comparisons between reporting periods and between agencies. Such information has the potential to be of great benefit to the parliament, to which agencies are held accountable, and to the public through media commentators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To assist those interpreting accrual based financial statements, the committee has recommended that the Department of Finance should develop a professional marketing strategy directed at the potential users of agency financial statements and also that the Department of the Senate and Department of the House of Representatives develop information and training packages on the new financial reports for members of parliament and parliamentary staff. For its part, the committee intends to write to all parliamentarians and party whips informing them of the type of accountability and performance information that can be derived from such reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that accrual information is an essential tool for modern public sector day-to-day management. Without regular access to accrual information, it is not possible to make accurate assessments of the cost of service provision and thereby the efficiency of program performance. It is of concern to the committee that, as yet, only a few agencies have recognised the value of accrual information, and even fewer have taken the initiative to explore the full potential of accrual information. The committee believes that, at agency level, accrual based financial management systems should be introduced and more should be done to educate managers in how to make best use of accrual information. There should also be incentives to encourage agencies to adopt the reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee makes a specific recommendation in the report that the government should make a statement stressing the value of accrual information as an aid to effective management of public resources and supporting the move towards full accrual accounting for government agencies. Recommendation No. 11 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All agency heads should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) commit themselves and their agencies to the implementation of accrual management systems and practices . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee intends to review, 12 months after the tabling of this report, a sample of agencies to test their performance in implementing accrual accounting systems and accrual management practices.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee notes that there is a basic incoherence in the Commonwealth's financial management system&mdash;funds are appropriated on a cash basis, but end of year reports are now made on an accrual basis. In the committee's opinion, this is not only inelegant but also sends mixed messages to managers. Managers are inclined to focus on cash&mdash;it is cash they have been appropriated&mdash;but the end of year accrual reports mean that they are held accountable for more than just managing cash. Such a system is likely to undermine the potential of the reforms undertaken to date. The committee has recommended, therefore, that there should be a major review of the Commonwealth's system of budget appropriations to consider the merits of requiring that budgets be prepared and appropriations made on an accrual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 338 concludes with a discussion of the next major accounting reform for the Commonwealth&mdash;whole of government reporting. The committee believes that preparing such reports on an annual basis would provide information of great value to cabinet, to the government's key economic advisers, to parliamentarians and to many other external users. Whole of government reports would help inform strategic decisions about government priorities and policies and would enable the government to better account for its use of public resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much work needs do be done in teasing out the issues surrounding the preparation of whole of government reports, and the committee has decided to maintain its involvement in this area by conducting a separate and more detailed review of the issues involved. The committee intends to report on these matters during the course of the current parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise that the recent introduction of accrual reporting across the Commonwealth public sector should be seen as only one step in the reform process. The committee has found that the core sector area still retains a cultural attachment to cash accounting, and the committee believes there is a danger that the reform process will stall unless the government sets new targets beyond just accrual reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should articulate a clear vision for the future of financial reporting in the Commonwealth, incorporating whole of government reporting, accrual management and, possibly, accrual based budgeting. A statement of direction from the government would give great impetus to the tentative steps now being taken by agencies toward accrual accounting and accrual management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to express our thanks to the people who contributed to the review by preparing submissions and by giving evidence at public hearings. I would also like to thank the staff of the secretariat for assisting the committee in preparing the report, in particular Laura Gillies, Donna Christophers, Jennifer Hughson, John Carter and Grant Harrison.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1990, the Veterans' Entitlements (Rewrite) Transition Act 1991, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992, the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Act 1994, and the Military Compensation Act 1994. The bill will also repeal two obsolete War Service Homes Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains a number of minor policy and technical changes to Veterans' Affairs legislation. The amendments improve readability, correct imperfections in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 rewrite, and correct typographical errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill rectifies anomalies in certain assessments of service pension and income support supplement. These include the calculation of child-related payments and of rent assistance for certain blind pensioners, and also for certain war widows and war widowers who receive a "frozen rate" of service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the changes to the provisions for service pensions have been made to bring consistency with the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow people participating in local exchange trading systems to do so without their non-cash credits being taken as income in the assessment of their service pension or income support supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carers of service pensioners who accompany the veteran overseas will be able to continue to receive their carer service pension for up to three months of their temporary absence from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also extends eligibility for a remote area allowance to service pensioners and income support supplement recipients who are residents of Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. A remote area allowance is to help compensate residents for the higher than normal costs associated with living in a remote area of Australia. Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island are acknowledged as remote areas for taxation purposes, and the extension of eligibility for a remote area allowance under the Veterans' Entitlements Act to residents of those islands will remove an anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President,  the period for which Somalia is an operational area for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act is to be closed as from 30 November 1994. Somalia has been an operational area under the Veterans' Entitlements Act since 20 October 1992. All Australian personnel serving in Somalia were withdrawn by 30 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two acts to be repealed are the:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">War Service Homes Agreement Act 1932; and the</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">War Service Homes (South Australia) Agreement Act 1934.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These acts approved agreements between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Commissioners of the then State Savings Bank of Victoria, and between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of South Australia, to arrange the transfer back to the "War Service Homes Commissioner" of the Bank's or the State's interest in certain war service homes. If there was any continuing Commonwealth interest in the properties covered by those agreements it was transferred to the Westpac Banking Corporation when it took over the Defence Service Homes mortgage portfolio in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The War Service Homes Agreement Act 1932 and the War Service Homes (South Australia) Agreement Act 1934 serve no further purpose, and their repeal is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, Mr President, this is a bill without financial impact that will put into place a number of minor changes. An outcome of the changes is improvement in the administration of benefits for veterans and their dependants.</PARA>

<PARA>Notice of motion No. 1 has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice paper</EMPHASIS> for a while. It has been there because it has been of importance to listen to the various arguments that have been put to us in relation to this matter. I was offered and received a briefing from the government on this matter. I understand the matter has been looked at on several occasions. However, recent freedom of information data has revealed that there are matters that have not been dealt with, and it would seem that there is sufficient prima facie evidence for the matter to be looked into by an inquiry. No matter how much the matter has been dealt with in the past, there has not actually been an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make it clear to the Senate that the wording in my motion is conservative. It is conservative in relation to the fact that it asks for matters to be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry as to whether an independent inquiry is justified into the conduct of the Commonwealth's actions in relation to Ryker (Faulkner) v. the Commonwealth and Flint, in particular into the reasons for severe limitations being imposed on the management of Mrs Faulkner's case and the evidence at the trial. That means looking into whether or not the Commonwealth is suggesting that Mrs Faulkner's case was weak because it was unsubstantiated, whether or not the right thing was done in not allowing witnesses to substantiate the case, or whether or not there was any interference with evidence. It is important to establish whether there are issues that remain unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what the history of the case may be from years and years ago, if there are relatively recent events which appear to require investigation, that is what the committee is being asked to do. The committee is not being asked to sit as judge and jury, it is not being asked to sit as lawyers, but it is being asked to look at the evidence presented, especially in light of recent freedom of information-obtained data to find out whether, on the face of it, there seems to be the need for an independent inquiry. As this has never actually happened, that is why the motion is before the Senate today, to make sure&mdash;no matter what we think about what has happened over time&mdash;that the Commonwealth acted in a correct and proper way in its dealings in all ways in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter has been ongoing for some time. Without pre-judging the matter, I will acquaint the Senate with some of the details. Reg and Sylvia Faulkner ran an engineering company back in the 1960s called Trisal Engineering. There was a period of negotiation of some four years with the Department of Army, as it then was. As a result of those negotiations the Faulkners thought they had a contract, that the Army would be taking on their Trisal clip. The Army thought otherwise. As a result of representations the Faulkners say that Army made to it, they then acted to their detriment, and subsequently Mrs Sylvia Faulkner went bankrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a writ issued against the Commonwealth in the High Court jurisdiction, I think it was in 1974. That was subsequently transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The matter was not resolved until 1987. In other words, the proceedings had been ongoing for some 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of those proceedings it became apparent that a key witness to both sides, a Brigadier Flint, was a main player in the evidence in the case. This reference seeks to look at the Commonwealth's conduct during those proceedings and, in particular, in relation to the evidence produced at trial. The Faulkners say that Brigadier Flint in a letter to the Defence Ombudsman, I think it was, had said that he had acted with authority in the representations he made to the Faulkners, that is, that when he spoke to the Faulkners about whether their clip would be purchased by the army he had authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At trial Brigadier Flint said that he did not have authority. So there was a change in the evidence. The question is: how did that come about? Through freedom of information applications it became apparent that there were various notes of conversations made by Commonwealth officers whereby certain statements were made and Brigadier Flint's evidence was discussed. It is in relation to this aspect of the Commonwealth's approach to that matter that part of this reference relates. Among other things, there is a notation that Brigadier Flint should be required to say that he acted without authority, which was contrary to his previous statement. That is an aspect which needs looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are comments about Brigadier Flint's pension&mdash;that he should be told that he does not have to worry about his pension. Brigadier Flint had retired. It is alleged that he was worried about his pension and that the Commonwealth had raised this as an aspect of relevance and that it should be brought to his attention that he did not have to worry about his pension, the presumption there being that if Brigadier Flint was worried about his pension his actions or evidence might be flavoured in some way. I do not make any judgment either way in this regard. It is simply a question of whether this merits further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as this, the Faulkners did have legal aid to conduct their case. However, this was limited before trial and they were denied legal aid for the purposes of obtaining witnesses who they say were essential to their case. These witnesses were overseas. There was the question of the cost involved and the question of relevance. Nonetheless, they say that they could not conduct their case in a proper fashion without a full grant of legal aid. That is another limb, if you like, of the reference&mdash;the Commonwealth's actions regarding the limiting of legal aid to the Faulkners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are questions of vital importance not just to the Faulkners but generally in regard to how the Attorney-General's Department conducts itself in litigation. We know that in past years the courts have said from time to time that the Attorney-General's Department should act as a role model litigant. I think that would go without saying and the people of Australia would expect that to be so. That aspect needs the general attention of the committee in this reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee might well make some observations one way or the other about this. Nonetheless, after looking at the aspects of this case, the coalition and I believe that it does merit the attention of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. Some of the terms of reference have been altered so that the issues have been distilled. Other issues were raised in relation to this matter, but the mover of the motion, and I support it, has seen that it is best to concentrate on the nub of the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is not prejudging anything. It is merely bringing to the Senate's attention a situation which has cause for concern. I am not saying that it is a case which has been made out. We are certainly not at that stage. That is a case for the committee to decide. But, in the first instance, after having met with the officials from the department, who have been most helpful, I believe, and the coalition believes, that there are questions which remain unanswered and which should be answered in the interests of justice and to ensure that we, as protectors of the law in this country and as legislators, question the system of justice and question how the government involves itself in litigation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the referral of this matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I will make a few explanations as to why we do oppose it. Having looked at the matter overnight, I cannot remember a matter which had been dealt with so comprehensively so long ago being brought to the attention of this parliament. I cannot think of a matter which least deserves the amount of time that has been planned for it to receive through this process than this one. I hope Senator Spindler, Senator Ellison and senators from the Greens listen to some of what I am about to say, because I think it needs to be placed in the context of the history of how this matter has been dealt with to explain why the government opposes it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a matter which arose in the 1960s. I am advised that Mrs Faulkner's company invented the Trisal clip, which, I understand, is a haulage clip for securing tow ropes. Mr and Mrs Faulkner sought to sell the clip to the Australian Army. In attempting to do so, they had many dealings with the then engineer-in-chief of the Australian Army, Brigadier Flint. Over a period of years, the relationship between Flint and the Faulkners turned sour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1974, therefore, proceedings were instituted against the Commonwealth and former Brigadier Flint. In those proceedings it was alleged that: Brigadier Flint made negligent or fraudulent statements in relation to the army's intentions to buy a large volume of Trisal clips from Mrs Faulkner's company, and to promote use of those clips by the armed forces of other countries; Mrs Faulkner invested in her company in reliance on these statements; orders of the size foreshadowed did not eventuate and the company failed; and Mrs Faulkner lost her investment in the company and also lost the financial benefits she would have derived from exploitation of her patent rights in the clips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in this case we are talking about conduct from the 1960s and proceedings instituted in the 1970s&mdash;matters from 20 to 30 years ago. The matter went to the supreme court. It was dismissed by Mr Justice Allen of the New South Wales Supreme Court in 1987. It is a 71-page judgment. The judgment, I am informed, was a comprehensive rejection of the allegations made by Mrs Faulkner, based on what was clearly a very thorough examination of the documentary and other evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at the judgment of the judge in 1987. As I say, we are talking about actions that happened in the 1960s and 1970s and a comprehensive court appraisal in 1987. From the judgment it appears that Mr and Mrs Faulkner set up Brigadier Flint to make the representations of which they complained and that, to the extent that any representations were false, the Faulkners were not misled&mdash;and this teems out of the judgment of the supreme court. Rather, the representations were made for the purpose of the Faulkners passing them on to others such as financiers, potential purchasers. One only has to look at page 26 of the judgment to get that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that Senator Ellison understand that the judge found that Brigadier Flint had engaged in unacceptable behaviour, and that is acknowledged. The judge was satisfied that it suited the Faulkners very well that Brigadier Flint had compromised himself&mdash;and that is in the judgment at page 44. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining whether we take this matter on it is important to note the comments by the judge, having rejected the Faulkners' evidence, and findings as to credibility. They are in the judgment and they are worth placing on the record in this place so that we can appraise the people who are producing this information and the information they are producing. A judge that I have no knowledge of, but in court in 1987, an eminent judge in New South Wales, Mr Justice Allen, had this to say about credibility:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Analysis of Mr Faulkner's conduct, however, reveals that not only was he grandiloquent but that he was one who deceitfully manipulated others to his own selfish ends, who played upon their own weaknesses of character, who lied when he thought that it was to his advantage to do so and who lashed out in a frenzy to get even with those whom he had considered had let him down.</PARA>
<PARA>That is telling in itself. But he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Underneath the veneer was a ruthless and amoral man. . . the basic personality remains&mdash;and the basic attitudes remain.</PARA>
<PARA>This is page 7 of the Supreme Court judgment. It is neither I nor the government saying it. This is what the judge who heard the case said about the credibility of those who are now seeking this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not come to this issue with any degree of background other than having read a brief overnight. But it is important to keep in mind the judge's assessment of the proponents in this matter. At page 63 of the judgment he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I forebear from going into detail as to the conduct of the Faulkners after they found themselves to be financially destitute. The wildness and the vindictiveness of the accusations contained in the written material which is in evidence speaks for itself. It reflects no credit upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent that in so far as the plaintiff's case must depend upon the reliability of the evidence of Mr Faulkner as to conversations involving the brigadier it is an edifice without foundations. The brigadier emerges with damaged credibility but Mr Faulkner emerges with no credibility.</PARA>
<PARA>So this is the judgment of the court, having heard all the matters, having adduced all the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that judgment&mdash;I think Senator Ellison picked up on this&mdash;the Faulkners have made a number of allegations of which two are probably pertinent to this particular motion. One assertion is that limitations were placed on the management of Mrs Faulkner's case. In matters such as this there are two questions to be determined: liability and the quantum of damages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset it should be made directly clear that the Commonwealth did not directly impose any limitation on the management of the Faulkners' case. Rather, after Mrs Faulkner's bankruptcy&mdash;which was another complicating circumstance in this complex tale&mdash;the Commonwealth was providing legal funding for her case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 some limitations were imposed on the amount of that funding. Attorney-General Duffy and Attorney-General Lavarch, together with the Minister for Justice, Michael Tate, examined these allegations about the limitation. The reasons for the limitation on funding have been given; they have been justified on many occasions to the Faulkners and others who made representations on their behalf. I must also place on record here that, although there have been allegations of impropriety, no evidence has been adduced to support those allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that in relation to the question of the Commonwealth's alleged liability to the Faulkners, which was the first thing that had to be established by the Faulkners, I am advised that legal funding was continued on terms and conditions consistent with the advice of the Faulkners' senior counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that brings us to another matter. Not only did they lose the case, not only were they slammed in the court but, thereafter, they turned against their senior counsel as well&mdash;and that is something which I think people appreciate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that funding of approximately $550,000 was refused&mdash;it is unfortunate that Senator Ellison is not listening to this&mdash;in relation to the calling of overseas witnesses. I am advised that the plaintiff's senior counsel had described that part of the plaintiff's claim in respect of which the overseas witnesses were necessary as `somewhat speculative'. The Solicitor-General, who had been instructed by Attorney-General Bowen to consider the plaintiff's claim in the context of a review of legal aid funding, described this part of the claim as `entirely speculative and very close to being bereft of any legal or factual justification'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was thus entirely proper, given the advice on the one hand from the plaintiff's counsel that it was somewhat speculative and the advice on the other hand from the Solicitor-General that it was entirely speculative and bereft of any legal or factual justification, for the Commonwealth to decline the funds for the calling of overseas witnesses on the basis that that would have been a waste of public funds. Moreover, it is worth noting that the witnesses related to the amount of damages which they claimed to have suffered rather than the liability. The first question to be tried was the question of whether there was in fact liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supreme Court of New South Wales ordered that the two questions&mdash;that is, the quantitative damages as opposed to whether the Commonwealth could be found to be liable&mdash;were to be tried separately. The liability issue was tried first. The witnesses from overseas&mdash;which involved $500,000 worth of airfares and whatever&mdash;went to the question of quantum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having tried the liability question first, the court found that the Faulkners had not established liability and therefore it did not need to consider the issue of damages. Thus, the limitation on funding in relation to overseas witnesses, even if it was unjustified, did not limit the plaintiff's capacity to conduct their case in relation to the Commonwealth's liability, which they lost. I think Senator Ellison will appreciate that the court said that you have to establish liability first and then you can go to the quantum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you had been listening for the last 10 minutes, you might have understood why all this is relevant. Out of a cooperative arrangement, the Commonwealth was asked to foot the bill for an extra $550,000 to bring in overseas witnesses relating to the question of the quantum, not the liability. They got tossed out on liability in a very comprehensive way by the court. That led to what normally happens in these situations where the clients come to the conclusion that their senior counsel did not understand the nature of their case so they turn on the senior counsel. That is essentially the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a very compelling judgment the supreme court talks about credibility and tosses out this case. I have gone through the question of Commonwealth funding. I am informed that there was no limitation on the funding for the first case establishing the liability of the Commonwealth that went before the supreme court&mdash;the case which was tossed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the other matter which Senator Ellison raised about the Commonwealth's conduct with respect to the evidence. Those allegations have been considered by the Attorney-General and rejected. I am aware that documents have been released under the FOI Act which have been used to support allegations that the Commonwealth, through its senior counsel and officers, took action with a view to having Brigadier Flint give false evidence in the Commonwealth's favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advice is that the material indicates that the Commonwealth had a firm belief that Brigadier Flint had not been telling the truth in relation to his dealings with the Faulkners.

It is apparent that what was being considered were means by which it might be possible to have Brigadier Flint tell what the Commonwealth regarded as the truth. Moreover, there is no evidence that any approach was made to Flint and officers consulted have denied having done so. Taking up your point, Senator Margetts, the problem you have is that you are trawling up a case which relies on the facts of some 30 years ago&mdash;a case which was comprehensively knocked off in the supreme court and a case in which the Commonwealth, particularly on a political level, has acted with total propriety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot think of a matter which has less relevance to current considerations and less substance in terms of arguments about access to justice than this one. You are talking about people who have had their credibility bounced by the supreme court in a comprehensive way. You are talking about people who, like many in this case&mdash;we get them day after day in our offices; I used to get them day after day in the legal profession&mdash;go from one lawyer to another, not being satisfied that the lawyer they had before, the one before that and the one before that could understand their case. As a consequence, they then turn on their lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this case is worthy of any more money being spent on it by the Commonwealth. I do not think it is worthy of getting priority in this place over so many other cases of current relevance to issues such as access to justice. I honestly think this is just a waste of time of this place and a waste of the priorities of senators. The government, having gone back through the evidence on this, would suggest that we have a lot of better things to do with both our time and money.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This case has been dragging on for many years. I remember getting the first submissions on it shortly after I entered the Senate in 1990. I appreciate the comprehensive statement that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has put before the Senate. There is little point served in my repeating the detailed technical aspects of the case as put on record by the minister, Senator Ellison and Senator Margetts.</PARA></TALK.START>

In this case, the Australian Democrats support the limited inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee to establish whether a further inquiry is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hesitate to commit the resources of the committee to a comprehensive inquiry into this case. The decision to support a limited one is made on balance. But it is incumbent upon us in a case such as this to spend a few hours establishing whether or not the case of the individual vis-a-vis the government has been made out or, on the balance of probability, is likely to be made out and whether it should go further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say something about this matter because some grey issues are involved here. Senator Spindler, for whom I have a great deal of admiration, particularly in the field of civil liberties, has said it is always difficult for an individual to get a fair hearing. The inference in that is that our court system is loaded against those who do not have as much money as those to whom they are opposed in the court. Whether judges can adjust that is a matter of opinion. In my view, the courts struggle and, in most cases, succeed in seeing that justice is done. Nevertheless, if it is the position of those who want this to go ahead that justice is not done in the courts of Australia, so be it. But it is certainly not an inference that I want to be associated with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler has said that this will take only a few hours. But what it must be, in effect, is an appeal from the decision that the courts have made. No matter how you try to look at it in any other way, that is it. The Legal and Constitutional References Committee has to inquire into whether an independent inquiry is justified into the conduct of the Commonwealth's actions in relation to Ryker (Faulkner) v. the Commonwealth and Flint and, in particular, the reasons for the severe limitations imposed on the management of Mrs Faulkner's case. I would have thought that a quite nasty reflection upon the counsel appearing for Mrs Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how the counsel conducted that case. I do not know who the counsel was. But it was certainly conducted in a place where privilege is often misused. It is a very interesting suggestion that somehow her case was not conducted properly. I can think of nothing worse than somebody saying about me as counsel that I had placed severe limitations on the way I conducted my client's case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, if the Senate is so minded as to cast those sorts of aspersions on the very terms of the motion on Mrs Faulkner's counsel, so be it. All I can say is that it might have been at least reasonable to hear what her counsel and her lawyers had to say before we brought this sort of motion into this chamber. I would have thought it would be a matter of fairness that a professional person would have been given some warning, and perhaps he was, before that sort of imputation was put upon him or her&mdash;I am not sure of the sex of the counsel or the solicitor instructing the counsel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it to be&mdash;to use the most mild word&mdash;a most ungenerous approach to the lawyers. Maybe I am not taking that properly. Perhaps that particular section is referring to the severe limitations on the judge. If that is so, again it seems to be a most nasty and unhappy aspersion on the justice who was listening to the cases, Mr Justice Allen. In any event, the Senate seems intent upon pursuing that course. I suppose there is not much that we on this side of the chamber can do about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the evidence of the trial. I think Senator Bolkus said this trial took some considerable time. So the Legal and Constitutional References Committee has to look to see whether an independent inquiry is justified into the conduct of the Commonwealth's actions in relation to the case, and in particular to the evidence of the trial. That will involve looking at all the evidence that was put before the trial. We will have no assistance, as I take it, from counsel. We will be getting, as I understand, the views of one side and then making a decision which is very properly a decision that should be made in an appeal court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, if the Senate is so disposed to ignoring and setting aside what I call a very good system in Australia of original hearings and a whole series of appeals to the High Court, and if it is so disposed to setting up an inquiry as to whether an inquiry should be held, so be it. I certainly see all sorts of problems with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee then has to suggest whether an independent inquiry can be set up. At least one of the litigants in this case was unhappy with the independent inquiry that has already been held into this matter by the courts. This is an aspersion on the Supreme Court of New South Wales, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What evidence is there that any independent inquiry we set up is going to satisfy those particular litigants? How long will it take us to look at all the evidence of this trial to see whether or not some part of it was not fair? Are we as senators better placed than the courts themselves to decide what is fair and what is not fair? Unless we have a vigorous inquiry into this matter through adversarial means, inquisitorial means or both, how can we say we are going to be in a better position than the courts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I do not like about this procedure is this: many people have difficulties in the courts and feel that they do not receive justice. Is the process going to be established whereby if you lobby people in this chamber you can go behind the judicial system&mdash;that is what is happening here&mdash;and get an inquiry? What about all the other people who are disappointed and who say they get unfair hearings when further evidence arises later on? Why should they be excluded from this process? Why should these particular people&mdash;I do not know who they are&mdash;be blessed over everyone else? Why do other people have to go through the judicial system to get results when these people can lobby so successfully? More than half the Senate is now going to vote for a process that other people in the same or a worse position cannot achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the people who have been gaoled? What about the people who have received bad results from the perjured and false evidence from the police in New South Wales? Why are we not doing something about them? The instant case is a civil case, but for some strange reason we are going to enter into the field of the judicial system, extrapolate one case, and say, `We are really doing justice.' The only connection that this matter has with the Senate is that one of the litigants was the Commonwealth and the other was Flint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Commonwealth is a litigant does it have to be treated differently in the courts? Does that mean that the courts are not going to administer fair and equal justice? Does it mean that the courts are going to administer one sort of justice for BHP and all the other big companies and some other justice for the Commonwealth? Are we going to say that there is equal justice for all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not persist because clearly the numbers are against us on this side of the chamber. I was pleased to hear Senator Bolkus's contribution in opposition to this proposition. This measure is going to produce the problems I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great pride in the committee system in this place. Over the years the Clerk has worked quite magnificently for the committee system. This action throws an awful strain on the system. In this situation people's reputations are being put on the line and their credibility is tested. The members of the committee might have quite different views about the evidence put before them. The committee will, in effect, become something of an appellate court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action is really asking for leave to appeal to another body outside the judicial system about a case that has already been decided within the judicial system. I do not believe that type of exercise is good for the committee system in this chamber. We should be looking at such issues as drought. Senator Ferguson has conducted inquiries which I believe should be the business of these committees. But in any event, it is no good rabbiting on. I have indicated my attitude to this and, in those circumstances, I will, sadly, take my seat. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very saddened to hear Senator Bolkus, on behalf of the government, suggesting that the character of a person should be important in deciding whether or not we are careful or particularly careful as to the actions of the Commonwealth in dealing with that person. If we are talking about characters and credibility here, I am horrified to hear a minister getting up and suggesting that the character of a person should determine whether or not we look into whether the Commonwealth has acted correctly. Does that mean somehow that justice is more important for nice people than it is for people who might not be as likeable? I do not know, but I would be horrified if that were the basis upon which we are acting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the reasons we are acting today. It is not necessarily about what happened back in 1964&mdash;there are aspects of that, of course; it is about the actions of the Commonwealth and it is about protecting the system.

There is notorious exploitation principally of migrant outworkers who often do not have a facility in English, who work under a naked light globe in a back room in suburban Melbourne or Sydney more often that not and who are paid usury wages.

Obviously we are opposed to that type of exploitation which falls outside of the reach of the industrial relations system in this country and, therefore, should be properly addressed. Secondly, there are a number of employers in this industry who are respectable and honest employers. While the issue of outworkers remains ill-defined as to who are the culprits, the honest employers get labelled as bad employers while the bad employers tend to get off scot-free. This inquiry will identify who are the baddies and who are the goodies, exonerate the goodies and condemn the baddies. That is an appropriate thing to be done in the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was somewhat surprised to hear Minister Cook talk about the outcome of the inquiry before we have had it. Last Thursday, when Senator Spindler raised this matter in the Senate, both Senator Childs as deputy chair and I as chair of the Senate Economics References Committee indicated that we would oppose the motion put forward by Senator Spindler. I want to make it quite clear that our opposition to that motion was purely the procedure that had taken place for the raising of the matter in the Senate. Senator Spindler, as a full member of the economics committee, had not raised the matter at a committee meeting where it could have had proper discussion by all members of the committee. In that way there could have been some input from all members of the committee into the devising of the terms of reference. That consultation has taken place this week with Senator Spindler, Senator Childs and me and then later at a full committee meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were never opposed to the concept of the inquiry because we believe it to be a very important issue. As the minister has said on behalf of the government, and as other coalition members have said, we have always thought it an important issue and, certainly, one worth inquiring into. What we were opposed to at that stage was the procedure that had been followed whereby the matter was raised in the Senate before it had been properly discussed by our committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, both Senator Childs and I said at that earlier stage that, if the matter was adjourned, it could then be discussed by the committee. So we have come up with revised terms of reference which I think cover all the aspects Senator Spindler wants to raise in that inquiry, and I think, probably through the input of six or seven people on the committee, we have come up with something that is acceptable to everybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I would like to highlight with regard to the committee, and this also applies to other committees, is that committees themselves at some stage have to have some control over their agenda, the amount of work before the committee and the amount of work put onto the secretariat when there is more than one inquiry proceeding at once. Let me say that the last three references to the economics committee have all been raised in this place before they have gone to the Senate committee for discussion. It just so happens that the last three references have been raised by the Democrats. This has meant that the work the committee wants to do&mdash;whether it is work that government members of the committee want to do, references they may want to bring forward, or references coalition members may wish to bring forward&mdash;has all been superseded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that Senator Spindler did speak to me privately about this at the end of June, but we, both government and coalition members of the committee, have not had an opportunity to discuss it. There are areas that members have an interest in and that they would like to develop references on themselves, but in each case they have not been able to do so because of matters raised in the Senate without consultation with the committee as a whole which have been forced upon the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say that, in the new terms of reference devised following committee discussion, there is purposely no reporting date in this new, amended motion. That is due to the fact that we have had a reference with regard to telecommunications towards the year 2000&mdash;this is the last reference that was generated from within the committee&mdash;which we have been hearing for some 18 months. It has had to be pushed aside for other references which have needed urgent inquiry. Although they have been important references, I concede that, unless the committee has some control over its agenda, the good work done by committees in the past will be in danger of losing some significance. I know that applies not only to our committee. It can be said, because of the change in the nature of committees, that some references have been generated in the same way as Senator Spindler has brought this matter forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, let me say that I certainly support this reference. I think it is a very important one, and there are lots of matters that we need to look into. I anxiously await the evidence that might come before the committee. I certainly will not pre-judge what might happen at the committee because we may find out lots of things we now do not know about. The committee is unanimous in its decision that this reference should now go forward in its amended form.</PARA>

I also thank Senator Chamarette for her comments. I am glad that the discussions we have been able to have in the last week, both outside and within the committee, have resulted in terms of reference which in substance do not differ from the terms of reference I put forward last Thursday, as Senator Ferguson has said.

So I am gratified that we have finished up with the same substance, the same motion, that I moved last Thursday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important reference. It arises from a report by the TCF union into the practice of outworking in the garment industry both in Melbourne and in Sydney. It is an area of our industrial work that we must pay some attention to. We are rightly critical of the working conditions that obtain in some of the countries which are our trading partners in this region and elsewhere. There is some evidence that in our own backyard&mdash;and I use that term advisedly&mdash;working conditions are imposed on people that are anything but fair and just. We must ensure that the conditions for which we have fought for so long in this country are protected. In particular, I have an interest in children under 15 who are being exploited in various industrial contexts overseas. In this case there is some evidence that this may happen in Australia as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was adjourned yesterday I had finished dealing with one of the four main elements of the bills before us, namely, the restructuring of the Refugee Review Tribunal. The second main element relates to the provision in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of all members of the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. Currently, only the principal members' remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. Other members' remuneration details are prescribed by the Migration Act, at SES band 1 levels for full-time members and amounts determined by the minister in writing for part-time members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal contained in the bill is to bring the IRT and RRT into line with the arrangements applicable to similar tribunals such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Veterans Review Board. Giving the Remuneration Tribunal the responsibility to set remuneration because it is in line with other tribunals is, therefore, not objectionable in itself, and the coalition supports that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision in the bill to deny the Remuneration Tribunal the ability to lower the remuneration for members appointed before 1 July 1995 is, however, at odds with the spirit and purpose of the transfer of the determination of the terms and conditions to an independent assessment body. There is no justification, in our view, for prohibiting the Remuneration Tribunal lowering remuneration if it deems that appropriate, especially when most appointments were made last year for a period of five years and many of those appointments, as we have debated on other occasions in the Senate, were obviously political appointments whereby the minister, Senator Bolkus, was favouring his political mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the provision left intact, if the bill goes through unamended, the Remuneration Tribunal effectively only has the power to grant remuneration increases. The government's justification for this no-downward provision is that it maintains equity between future members, if they get paid more, and also fulfils employment and remuneration conditions entered into by those people at the time of their employment. But the government's position is inherently inconsistent. On the one hand, it talks about preserving conditions applicable at the commencement of the employment. If it wanted to do this, it would make the new Remuneration Tribunal provisions only applicable to new appointments and exempt old ones, who would continue under their existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, it talks about equity between all members, new and old, but will not allow the Remuneration Tribunal to properly implement this by reducing remunerations where it is determined to be appropriate. It may be that the Remuneration Tribunal would never want to reduce terms and conditions of employment. Nevertheless, to prevent it doing so in relation to certain of those appointments is, in our view, inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not believe that the government can have it both ways. We come down on the side of equity, with all members being treated equally under the proposed arrangements. On behalf of the coalition I have had circulated an amendment which seeks to remove clauses 6 and 7 of the bill. They deny the Remuneration Tribunal the ability to lower remuneration for existing IRT or RRT members. I hope the Senate will give serious consideration to supporting that proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The third issue involved in the bills relates to investment-linked visa cancellation provisions. The amendment to provisions for the cancellation of certain business skills visas contained in the bill follows last year's recommendations by the Business Skills Advisory Panel, better known as the Deveson committee. In particular, it incudes special cancellation procedures for the new investment-linked class of visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed cancellation provisions, as outlined in the government's explanatory memorandum, allow the minister to cancel an investment-linked visa `where the minister is satisfied that the person who held the designated investment relevant to the grant of the visa has or have ceased, for any reason, to hold that investment within three years of the investment being made'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions provide for notification and also the cancellation of related family members visas. There is also an amendment to make the established business in Australia visa subject to normal visa cancellation provisions rather than under the business skills provisions, which provide for Administrative Appeals Tribunal appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed visa cancellation arrangements for investment-linked and other special business skills visas, as recommended by the Deveson committee, are, the coalition believes, a balance between the need for migrant investors to have a high degree of visa security and the minister to be able to revoke the visa in the event of a failure to fully comply with its conditions. That approach is consistent with that already applicable to other business skills visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to put the government on notice, however, that the coalition will be very closely scrutinising the new investor-linked visa class. We will be watching closely to ensure that this does not become another of those business migration schemes of the late 1980s, which, sadly, were so extensively rorted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The granting of additional statutory entitlements to applicants engaging the Immigration Review Tribunal has been a controversial aspect of this bill. The measures proposed in the bill include: the right to appear before the IRT where a hearing occurs; the right to assistance while appearing; the right to an interpreter; and the right to material submitted to the IRT. These measures are in accordance with the recommendations made in December 1992 by the Committee for the Review of the System for Review of Migration Decisions&mdash;a dreadful name for a committee&mdash;otherwise known as the Macphee committee after its Chairman, Ian Macphee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements applying to applicants before the Immigration Review Tribunal are, according to the minister and his department, all intended to give the applicant greater rights and opportunities at hearings. In line with the Macphee committee recommendations, they are intended to enhance the non-adversarial nature of the IRT. They overcome several concerns and shortcomings that have been expressed about the IRT's present operations. Most of the measures simply represent a codification of current arrangements following a Federal Court decision last year&mdash;that was in the case that has become known as the Tordo case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major exception is the restriction on legal representation. This move has created a great deal of controversy, especially among legal groups, and it was very much the focus of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee's consideration of this bill a few months ago. In that committee hearing, my colleagues Senators Ellison and Abetz, on behalf of the coalition, submitted a dissenting report which, very properly, drew to attention the major concerns the coalition has. The major concern was that we were not convinced that allowing lawyers to address the tribunal would necessarily make it adversarial. As I understand it, that was the essential thrust. But Senator Abetz, who I think is speaking later in this debate, may wish to elaborate on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition shares the concerns of Senator Abetz and Senator Ellison, although on balance we will not be opposing the government's provisions in the bill but we will be watching it very closely. It is an on balance decision and we nevertheless put the government and the IRT on notice that we will be closely scrutinising its operations under these new arrangements. If evidence substantiates that applicants are being unfairly dealt with by the IRT due to insufficient recourse to assistance, then we will certainly review our stance on this matter. But, at this stage, overall the coalition will be supporting the bills before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994: firstly, provides for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of members of the IRT and the Refugee Review Tribunal; secondly, enables the minister to cancel investment linked visas; thirdly, provides that people appearing before the immigration tribunal cannot, unless there are exceptional circumstances, present arguments to or address the tribunal; and, fourthly, provides that certain information must not be disclosed to an applicant to the IRT if the minister has certified in writing that it would be contrary to the public interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal first of all with the question of remuneration of tribunal members. Clauses 7 and 8 of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) ensure that the current remuneration of existing members of the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal will not be reduced when the Remuneration Tribunal gains authority to determine the remuneration of members of the two tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand, and we have heard from Senator Short, that the opposition is voting against these provisions because it believes that you either allow the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the salary and conditions of members or you do not; there should be no half-measures. In turn, we heard from the government in its second reading speech that it would be akin to a breach of contract to allow a possible reduction in the salary and conditions of members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have considered both arguments and, on balance, believe that the government's reasoning is more convincing. On that basis, we will not be supporting the opposition's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of the bill allows the minister to cancel an investment linked visa where the minister is satisfied that the person ceased to hold the investment within three years of it being made. This initiative stems from a review process that found people were rorting the system by transferring funds for a short period only&mdash;in fact, a period only long enough to, in effect, buy themselves a passport. The Democrats welcome this particular measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to what is probably the most contentious aspect of this bill, that advisers of people appearing before the tribunal may not directly address the tribunal or cross-examine witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that, while an applicant before the Immigration Review Tribunal is entitled to have another person present to assist him or her, that assistant however is not entitled to either present arguments to the tribunal, address the tribunal except in exceptional circumstances, or examine or cross-examine any person appearing before the tribunal to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, it is up to the discretion of a member of the IRT whether a representative of the person appearing before the tribunal may in fact address the tribunal. We have had Tordo's case where it was stated that the tribunal shall, in carrying out its functions, pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. However, Tordo's case could be interpreted as saying that a representative of a person appearing before the IRT has an absolute right to address the tribunal and to cross-examine witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the government believes, in view of its interpretation of Tordo's case, that it is necessary to introduce these particular amendments. The amendments attempt to change this situation by removing the members' discretion and by providing that a person is not entitled to address the tribunal unless there are exceptional circumstances&mdash;for example, where the applicant is disabled or mentally ill. That seems to me to be a fairly narrow interpretation of exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the government has introduced a mechanism which allows comments from advisers to be delivered, but insists that these comments will have to be delivered by the applicant rather than by the advisers. Where the concepts are complex, or where the language skills of the applicant are poor, the process could be seriously delayed. The case that is being made out on behalf of the applicant before the tribunal could be seriously disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to the Democrats that the skills of advisers are most useful in casting light on issues. We believe that an applicant or a person without the equivalent experience might not in fact be able to do this. As suggested by the Law Council of Australia, this presently occurs and is of significant assistance to the tribunal. The premise upon which this aspect of the bill appears to be founded is, following Tordo's case, that members of the tribunal will be obliged to allow a representative to address the tribunal even where they consider it to be inappropriate. That is only one interpretation of Tordo's case. Even if that is correct, it could have been achieved with an amendment which has a much more limited effect and which restores the discretion of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have actually visited the IRT office in Melbourne, examined its operation and discussed the issue at some length with IRT members. I have formed the view that IRT members are perfectly capable of appropriately exercising the discretion they have had so far. Therefore, in the Democrats' view, all the government needed to do to respond to Tordo's case was to simply restore that discretion and clarify that Tordo's case does not throw out the baby with the bath water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government has chosen to go the whole hog, as it were. I believe that the amendments deny people a fundamental right, particularly when questions of liberty are at issue. The need for people to be granted full access to representation is made all the more important by the fact that the IRT has a role in determining such issues when it assesses whether bridging visas should be granted. They are similar in nature to bail applications, given that they can result in a successful applicant being released from detention. Not allowing such representation in these circumstances is indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am rather disappointed that the coalition parties have decided to go along with the government's amendments and not take account of that very basic legal fact. I hope that even at this late stage they have a change of mind. I provided them with a copy of my amendments last night. I apologise for the lateness in providing the formal amendments. But the Democrats' position has always been on record. We have made it very clear that we will be moving amendments that will knock out the government's attempt to virtually exclude the discretion of IRT members to allow representatives to speak on behalf of applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us that the government's amendments will disadvantage, in particular, an inarticulate or poorly educated applicant. They also present a backward step in the representation of people from such backgrounds, as argued by a witness before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Mr David Bitel, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applicants before the IRT are generally among the least skilled members of the community dealing with bureaucratic and administrative matters. In addition, the legislation dealt with by the IRT is among the most complex and difficult of any affecting the everyday lives of ordinary people. To deny such people professional assistance in dealing with the tribunal is a contradiction of the government's fundamental commitment to the presence of access and equity for all members of society.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the government's fear that allowing such representation will necessarily make the tribunal an adversarial body is ill-founded. I believe that, apart from Tordo's case, there is absolutely no evidence that the discretion of IRT members in the past has been exercised to make it such. They have had that discretion for years, yet the exercise of that discretion has not resulted in making the IRT an adversarial body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that we are dealing with a massive over-reaction by the government to one particular case. I would be ready to admit that, if we want to treat the tribunal as a non-adversarial forum, there may be some justification for restricting the possible flow-ons from Tordo's case. But I do not think it calls for this sledgehammer approach that we are using here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another reason why these amendments should not proceed. The Administrative Review Council is at present conducting a major review of merit review tribunals, including the IRT. Why do we not wait until we have that review and then decide what measures are necessary? That report is expected to be handed down some time this year. It seems to me that the government could have waited until that report is made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the council `considers that many of the issues dealt with in the bill fall within the scope of the council's report', intervention at this time would seem most untimely. As I have indicated, we will be moving amendments to knock out these items in the schedule to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now move to the non-disclosure provisions of the bill. The Democrats will also be opposing those items in the schedule which provide that certain information must not be disclosed to an applicant to the IRT if the minister has certified in writing that it would be contrary to the public interest to do so. The Democrats agree with the comments in the report on this bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. There is much to be said in providing the IRT with a discretion to provide the information to the applicant if the interests of justice outweigh the reasons stated by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us wrong that the minister should have this unfettered discretion. Accordingly, we believe that the bill should be amended to grant the IRT a discretion to provide the information to the applicant if the interests of justice outweigh the reasons for non-disclosure advanced by the minister. At this stage, we will simply be moving an amendment to take out these provisions which give the minister such unfettered discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill proposes to amend the Immigration Education Act 1971 to provide for the automatic indexation of fees and charges. The amendments replace the current $250 maximum fee that may be charged in relation to English language courses with a fee that is going to be indexed at the beginning of each financial year. Given that the Democrats are opposed in principle to any increase in course fees for English language courses, we will also be voting against these particular provisions and the whole of the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, it is a question that goes to equity and access. We have seen statistics coming out at regular intervals which show that people of ethnic background have to struggle to keep their end up, as it were, in the job stakes and in education. It seems to us that providing the opportunity for newcomers to this country to receive English tuition should not have additional barriers placed in its way. As I said, I will be moving those amendments. Subject to those, the Democrats will be supporting the bill. </PARA>

In addressing only that bill, I will restrict my comments to proposed sections 366A and 366D, which are basically designed to overturn the Tordo decision, or the Tordo case&mdash;a decision of His Honour Justice Keely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That decision was brought down in 1993 and confirmed the procedures that had been adopted that the words `not entitled' meant that members of the tribunal had a discretion to allow an applicant's representative to address the tribunal and even to examine or cross-examine witnesses if this was required to produce a decision which was fair, just, economical, informal and quick. So, prior to the tribunal member deciding whether or not to allow cross-examination and representation to take place, the tribunal member had to exercise his or her mind as to whether or not it was fair, just, economical, informal and quick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say, I am somewhat disappointed that the opposition is not actually opposing this bill. On balance, we have decided to let it go through to the keeper and observe what happens in the future. From my own point of view, as expressed in the dissenting report which I co-signed with Senator Ellison, I am concerned that justice may not necessarily be done because it seems to me that, if a tribunal member comes to a decision that in the circumstances it would be fair, just, economical, informal and quick to allow cross-examination and legal representation to take place, surely justice demands that that be allowed. Unfortunately, this legislation completely denies that, except in very narrow circumstances such as if the person suffers from mental illness or is completely incapable of representing himself or herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice Keely, in the decision of Tordo, considered how the tribunal was to conduct its inquiries. Section 123 of the Migration Act required that the tribunal shall, in carrying out its functions under the act, pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Section 132 provided that a person appearing before the tribunal to give evidence was not entitled to be represented by any other person or to examine or cross-examine any other person appearing before the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So anybody before the tribunal did not have the right to cross-examine. It was only allowed if they were able to get over the threshold of convincing the tribunal member that it was fair, just, economical, informal and quick in the circumstances to allow that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When somebody's liberty or future is at stake I believe it is vitally important that, if the tribunal member so determines, legal representation be allowed. It seems very strange to me that if I am charged with going through an orange light or exceeding the speed limit by 10 kilometres per hour, as of right in this country I am entitled to legal representation to cross-examine all the police witnesses and to fight the case tooth and nail should I so desire. I would have thought that a person's rights under the Migration Act may well be a lot more important than the question of whether or not I ran foul of an orange light or whether I exceeded the speed limit by a small amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good book in Proverbs 18:17 tells us that the first to present his case seems right until another comes forward and questions him. That is the very basis of the right to cross-examination in our legal system: one side always sounds very, very good until the other side questions the person giving the evidence, questions the procedures adopted and questions the rationale under which a certain decision was taken. There are people in the community who are skilled advocates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I can possibly understand why one would not necessarily wish legal representation in each and every case, I would have thought that, if the tribunal member came to a determination that the circumstances of a particular case required legal representation to ensure justice and fairness, surely it ought to be allowed. If the government says that these tribunal members are not fit and proper persons to exercise that discretion&mdash;because they do not really know how to exercise it&mdash;they should not have been appointed in the first place to make determinations about people's future under this legislation. In a roundabout way the government is passing a vote of no confidence in the tribunal members in saying, `We do not think you are fit and proper to determine whether or not the discretion that is afforded to you ought to be exercised by you, and therefore we will take that discretion away.'&mdash;except, as I said, in very restricted circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very disappointed that when the matter came before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee we were told by the assistant secretary of the Legal Framework Branch that the tribunal would have some discretion in the implementation of the section. The majority report signed by Senator Cooney said on page 11 at paragraph 1.23:</PARA>

<PARA>and I want to stress the words `not entitled'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to address the Tribunal unless the Tribunal is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances. . . and the operation of proposed section 363A which apparently removes any discretion.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Spindler, who preceded me in this debate, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It removes the discretion of the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Read said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think so, yes.</PARA>
<PARA>I always have great concern when governments&mdash;and, unfortunately, governments of all persuasions do this&mdash;seek to put in minimum penalties and maximum penalties and do all manner of things to try to restrict those people within the community who have to exercise, for want of a better term, a judicial mind and to try to administer some sort of system of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we remove the discretion of tribunals, really we are limiting the range in which tribunal members can operate and restricting their capacity to deliver justice in each and every individual case. Sure, if you take the broad-brush approach you might say, `Yes, it can be arguable,' but, at the end of the day, justice is not about the broad-brush approach; it is about each and every individual that comes before the tribunal, the court or whatever tribunal or body is to make a determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The views of the Law Council of Australia are fairly clear, as was the view of the Bar Association of New South Wales. I do not wish to take any more time of the Senate in this regard, other than to commend the dissenting report of Senator Ellison and myself, and also those parts of Senator Spindler's dissenting report which deal with that one issue I wanted to address today, because it is a matter which is close to my heart. I am genuinely concerned about the way governments&mdash;might I add, of all persuasions, in all jurisdictions&mdash;seem to be moving in restricting the discretions being given to tribunals and other bodies that are charged with delivering justice and fair outcomes for individual citizens in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994, as the second reading speech by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) pointed out, seeks to make a number of amendments to the Migration Act and to other legislation. There have already been very good comments on, and explanations of, the bill from my colleagues in the chamber, so I will just mention the response of the Greens in relation to some of those. I will start with that part of the bill which, in my opinion, contains the most fundamental aspect of all the measures before us, and it is the one that Senator Abetz has been referring to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to limit the powers of the Immigration Review Tribunal in its ability to set its own guidelines for the conduct of hearings. It seeks to alter section 363 of the Migration Act by stating that, if a person is not entitled to do something, then the tribunal does not have the power to permit the person to do that thing. It will remove the tribunal's power to grant a person leave to be represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is the result of Justice Keely's ruling that the act, while it does not entitle a person to be represented at a tribunal hearing, does not prevent the tribunal from allowing representation. Justice Keely found that the tribunal has wide powers to decide what form of hearing would provide a fair, just, economical, informal and quick review of a case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at section 353(1) of the act, we find that the tribunal was set up to provide fair, just, economical, informal and quick review of immigration decisions. If I recall rightly, at the time I was very concerned about some of those terms which may well provide contradictions in terms. We cannot always find justice from the quickest measures; nor can we always find the fairest means through informal means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting that aside, I cannot help but wonder how the government's aim of hampering the tribunal will assist in ensuring fair and just decision making. Perhaps I am taking too negative a view of the government's motives here, but we are becoming too accustomed to dealing with migration or refugee legislation which is drafted in response to court decisions which the government does not like. In almost every case, the legislation is aimed at limiting the rights of people seeking review of decisions made by government departments. I would have felt more easy if we had been making a change to the law to make explicit that the tribunal should be able to give that leave or allow people to have that leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case, the government's motives must be even further questioned when we note that this restrictive change is not mentioned in the outline of the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Indeed, the changes to the Immigration Review Tribunal's functions are said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to provide the applicant with additional entitlements in relation to the presentation of, and access to, material before the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>While we cannot argue that such provisions exist, the provision to exclude any possibility of representation before the tribunal is conveniently not mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens will move an amendment to this provision in the committee stage. We just seek to drop the clause from the bill. I express my regret at already hearing in the chamber that, on balance&mdash;which is a very useful phrase at the moment&mdash;the opposition will not be supporting that amendment. I acknowledge the comments made by Senator Abetz, and also referred to in Senator Short's remarks, that it is not a consensus position of the opposition. I could wish that conscience voting would allow greater support for the amendment that I will put and that I understand is included in a range of amendments which will be put by Senator Spindler for the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Other matters in the bill which need to be mentioned at this point include the change whereby the Remuneration Tribunal will be empowered to determine the remuneration of members of the Immigration Review Tribunal and of the Refugee Review Tribunal. I understand that the opposition is opposing two clauses which set certain conditions in this area. I can only regard the opposition's stance on clauses 6 and 7 as part of an economic world view which says that, if a salary can be indexed, it must be able to be indexed downwards as well as upwards. It may well be that certain economic circumstances could arise in which such a course of action could suggest itself. However, these provisions apply only to current members, who will not be members forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's reasoning here seems simple enough: that if, by chance, the Remuneration Tribunal's first determination should set the salary for members of the IRT and RRT at a level lower than that at which the current members are appointed, then they should not be penalised. After all, they have accepted appointment to important positions within the community on terms and conditions put to them in good faith and they have accepted them in good faith. Why should the government now be able to change the rules in an arbitrary fashion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, if the current members' remuneration is higher than that provided for in the first determination of the Remuneration Tribunal, then their remuneration will simply stand still until that which applies to later members catches up in future years. Perhaps the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) could reassure me on that point when the Senate moves into the committee stage. As a result of that, we will not be supporting the opposition's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At the end of the bill provision is made for the level of certain fees relating to education services to migrants to be indexed. This is in line with the government's desire to have such fees increased automatically over time, reflecting the increased costs of providing the services as measured by some broad economic indicators. Clearly, this is a government policy decision which covers vast areas of service delivery and is similar to the decision made by this government in the early part of its time in office to index such things as certain excise duties and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of political heat has been taken out of the government's budget processes as a result. It can be seen as a logical and worthwhile move towards predictability for the community. We had not intended to oppose it in this case, at least in part because of the wider context in which the change is being made. But we will listen to Senator Spindler's comments and arguments in relation to this. The Greens intend, in spite of reservations, to support this bill but we certainly wish that our amendment to the schedule in relation to item 25 will gain some support and some reconsideration from the government, as the opposition seems to have made its stand already. </PARA>

The majority of the Senate, in effect, has taken a different view and would, on that view, treat these bills as bills imposing taxation and as therefore requiring requests rather than amendments.

So I ask the government to explain what its motivation is in this regard, because it comes across as highly restrictive of peoples' civil rights; also, it would set a precedent by restricting a tribunal in the powers and the discretion that it should legitimately exercise so as to ensure that the aims of the act&mdash;stated there as fair, just, economical and informal, et cetera&mdash;can be carried out properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have stated in my speech during the second reading debate, this is an amazing amendment by the government, saying to members of the tribunal, `You may not make certain decisions except in exceptional circumstances.' I ask the minister to explain. Although the term `exceptional circumstances' is mentioned in the bill a little further down, this is really the point at which, even at this stage, the government could remedy this extraordinary provision that is being imposed which removes the discretion of the tribunal that has been appointed to deal with applicants who in some cases may simply not be able to represent themselves properly. If the government were prepared to give a very wide definition to `exceptional circumstances' that may perhaps go towards ameliorating some of the still negative effects that this amendment will have. As it stands the Democrats will certainly oppose item 25.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Spindler will anticipate that I cannot give him that assurance. Exceptional circumstances have been mentioned, for instance, in my second reading speech&mdash;and we are talking about exceptional circumstances. I think the opposition agreed with us in respect of this. I recognise once again that Senator Abetz has a different perspective. Our proposal, our structure, is such that it does not embrace the adversarial approach before the IRT. As a consequence, we limit exceptional circumstances to situations where there are physical or intellectual disabilities or psychiatric conditions, for instance. But we do stick to that approach. It has at its roots the profile that we have of an IRT, which is one that does not work on the adversarial approach. So we do have a difference in starting points in a sense. We have a difference at least on this issue, which I am sorry we cannot resolve.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not sure that anything has been put forward by the minister to substantiate that assertion. Secondly, I ask the minister to exercise his mind as to what is the most important thing from the government's point of view.

I would like to hear the minister explain why the government is so concerned that it will turn into an adversarial system, what proof he has of that and, even if it were to, what is more important&mdash;the fairness and justice of the situation or for some reason not having any adversarial situation?</PARA>

All I will say is that we are of the view that once you allow cross examination the system becomes adversarial. Without traversing the whole raft of issues involved in this, let me say to Senator Abetz that the whole structure was intended to be flexible and non-adversarial; one which would allow access to people without their needing to go to lawyers; and one in which the department would not find itself being represented by lawyers before the tribunal as well.

<PARA>Dame Pattie Menzies was a magnificent Australian and indeed a warm and joyous human being. She managed to combine often potentially conflicting roles&mdash;on the one hand as a politician's spouse and a loving parent of three children and, on the other, to maintain an active involvement in a variety of forms of public life and community service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout her long life she never shied away from responsibility&mdash;she was always prepared to put her resources and energy back into the community and the country which had given her so much.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was enormously supportive of her husband's political career. The expression `behind every great man stands a great woman' is no longer particularly apposite in the current age, but the spirit that lies behind that proposition was never more apt than in her case.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie saw both family and community good as very worthwhile aspirations. Her life was devoted to the service of those close to her and those she believed had not been as fortunate as she had. She was therefore prepared on every occasion to make the necessary sacrifices. Those of us who were fortunate enough to see her in action at political functions can always remember the twinkle in her eye and the way in which she was able to make the strategic pause and capture the spirit of the audience. She was not a consummate orator, as undoubtedly was her husband, but nonetheless she was able to read the mood of a meeting. She was able to relate to people both publicly and privately.

She is recorded as saying, `One hears a lot of talk about rates of pension and so on.

I extend our sincere sympathy for yesterday's passing away of Dame Pattie Menzies at the great age of 96. For over 50 years, Dame Pattie has been one of the most admired women in our nation. The reverence in which she was held by the Liberal Party is demonstrated by the standing ovation she received when she attended the Liberal Party's 50th anniversary last year. Liberal Party president, Tony Staley, extolled her great contribution to the party and nation, calling her a great woman, one of our great wives and one of our great mothers. That is a heartfelt sentiment with which we here would all concur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Pattie was born to a life of politics. Her father served as both a state and federal member of the parliament, and when she met Sir Robert at the local Presbyterian Church her fate to hold a central role in Australian political life was sealed. Dame Pattie was a source of great strength to Sir Robert when his early political career faulted with his resignation as Prime Minister in 1941. She provided unstinting support, loyalty and hard work when his career made its magnificent resurgence in 1949. </PARA>

But I think the way this matter has been handled has resolved any of those problems which have emerged.

Our amendments will enable the community to undertake capital works, to protect and conserve natural and cultural sites on Aboriginal land, manage their land, conduct business enterprises and plan their land use needs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I would like to make the point that I share the concern of Senator Kernot that the residents of Jervis Bay, who have come today to listen to this legislation, are not able to see it taken through to finality. It ought to be realised that the reason for that is, given the amendments which have been proposed, that there is an agreement that amendments will not be processed at this time of day, which is principally set aside for non-controversial legislation. Therefore, unfortunately, by the government choosing to bring it on at this particular point, it is unable to be properly processed. It is through no fault of those of us on this side of the parliament. In fact, it should have been listed at a more appropriate time on the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to specifically address those aspects of the legislation that relate to Norfolk Island. There are clauses within this bill that set out to extend new and certain provisions to enable inquiries into the provision of reports to the minister on application made by Norfolk Island to the commission for a grant of special assistance, and any matter relating to a grant, or the making of a grant of financial assistance, by the Commonwealth to Norfolk Island, referred to it by the minister. Secondly, it requires the commission to inquire into and report to the minister on any matter relating to the financing of works and services provided by the Commonwealth, or a Commonwealth authority, to an external territory other than Norfolk Island, referred to it by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to recognise that we have a very special and unique relationship between the Australian parliament and the government of Norfolk Island. This is historical; it is based on a very long and negotiated special arrangement. Anybody who is familiar with the budget appropriations of the federal parliament will know that Norfolk Island makes very little demand and, in fact, operates on special financial arrangements, unique and very different to those that apply at our other external territories of Cocos (Keeling) Island and Christmas Island, where very generous and extensive financing is, in particular, made available. Therefore, the provision of an inquiry in this area must necessarily take into account the needs and the issues of Norfolk Islanders. </PARA>

At that meeting the NIG emphasized that the self governing status of Norfolk Island should be taken into account in any amendments, that the changes should include a clause to permit the Commission to respond to any future application for special assistance initiated by the NIG, and that no reference to Norfolk Island matters will be undertaken without prior consultation with, and agreement by, the NIG.</PARA>

I note that the draft explanatory memorandum attached to your letter still contains this error. Thank you very much for sending this Bill on to us. Although on this occasion there was indeed extensive consultation, that is regrettably not always the case.</PARA>
<PARA>The point I want to stress is the need for consultation and agreement of the Norfolk Island government in initiating any inquiries of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, earlier this year, there was a report by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Delivering the goods</EMPHASIS>. It is an important report which looks at external territories and it covers a number of issues. I am sure that Senator Reid and, I think, Senator Ian Macdonald are very familiar with the report as they were participants in that particular case. The report contains specific recommendations with regard to inquiries into issues arising in the various external territories of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 21 of the report specifically deals with the need to look at the cost of living of residents of Norfolk Island as a remote community and it recommends that inquiries should be extended to look at a number of issues in this area. Recommendation 22 of the report specifically recommends that the Minister for Finance decline to make any loans for transport infrastructure or shipping pending the outcome of an examination of the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island. It is important to recognise that there is a need for further inquiry, and this has been accepted by the parliament of Norfolk Island. However, these inquiries must be initiated only after full agreement has been reached with the local representatives of the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my initial comments, Norfolk Island is a unique place, and I refer to the discussions that the Norfolk Island parliamentarians have had with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon). In reading the report, it is very interesting to note that the residents of Norfolk Island are apprehensive and that they hold reservations. When Mr Snowdon visited Norfolk Island, he raised the hackles of many people there when he discussed the issue of how Australia will proceed with the issue of Australia becoming a republic. Following a report by Mr Snowdon, a local Norfolk Island paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Norfolk </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islander</EMPHASIS>, printed the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conversation with Mr Snowdon the question of the Australian republic was raised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that Australians in Norfolk Island would be involved in the referendums the same as Australians in the mainland and that when Australia became a Republic, which he seems to believe is a foregone conclusion, that Norfolk islanders `would just have to cop it sweet'.</PARA>

As the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) has mentioned, we support this bill. Mrs Gallus has consulted widely with community groups and business groups in the Nowra area. One group wrote to her to say that it sees this bill as a step which will help in the reconciliation process and will provide employment opportunities for the most disadvantaged group in the local labour market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill touches on three of my portfolio responsibilities: firstly, as shadow minister for the environment; secondly, as shadow minister for the ACT; and, thirdly, as shadow minister for administrative services. The bill amends the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986 and the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act is, of course, administered within the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, while the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act is administered within the Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will surprise some senators to learn that the Jervis Bay territory is, in effect, part of the Australian Capital Territory and that the laws enforced in the ACT operate in the Jervis Bay territory so far as they are applicable. A description of the Jervis Bay Territory and the legal regime which applies was outlined in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the sun</EMPHASIS>, which I think was referred to by my colleague Senator Tambling. As mentioned, this legislation enables title to the Jervis Bay National Park and Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens to be granted to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. It will then be leased back to the Commonwealth to be jointly managed as a national park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal on the land grant and lease-back follows the model established for Uluru National Park. This model includes legislative compulsory lease-back whereby the council is obliged to give a lease for continued management of the granted land as a national park. A board of management with a majority of representatives of the traditional Aboriginal owners will be established to oversee management of the park and gardens. Overseeing development of a plan of management to the area will be, of course, a major task of the board. Extensive public involvement in the development of the plan is required under the legislation. The legislation amends the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to enable the minister to establish a board for the national park and botanic gardens if they are declared to be Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal land grant act, and if agreement is reached with the council, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 is amended to extend the functions of the Grants Commission to inquire into the territory, as well as all external territories, and my colleague Senator Tambling dealt with some of the issues in relation to Norfolk Island. The proposed amendments will place Norfolk Island in the same position as the states and territories in respect of the Grants Commission survey. In that sense, the Grants Commission can be said to be an auditor and a determinator of the level of Commonwealth assistance. As mentioned, the coalition will be supporting this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to make only a short speech on this Aboriginal Land Grant and Management (Jervis Bay Territory) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, states that this bill reflects the continuing commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that this bill is yet another sham perpetrated by this government on Aboriginal people. The bill grants title of the Jervis Bay National Park and Botanic Gardens to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council who are then required, under the legislation, to lease their land back to the Commonwealth for the purpose of a national park. Existing legal rights of land-holders and public rights for use are preserved. A management plan is to be prepared under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. As it did over Mabo, the government is paying lip service to Aboriginal self-determination, while entrenching existing land title and placing paternalistic limits on the ability of Aboriginal people to manage their own land and affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) are appalled that the government finds itself incapable of coming to terms with the true nature of self-determination. This bill shows that it is utterly unwilling to return land back to its original owners, full stop. Instead, the land is returned but must then be leased back. Existing titles are maintained and a management regime is established under yet another act. Why is it that the government cannot grant land to Aboriginal people without the spectre of mistrust and suspicion hanging in the background? Reconciliation will never advance beyond its infant stage without non-indigenous people making unequivocal acts of trust in Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill not only fails to give the members of the Aboriginal community control over their land and activities; it also fails to affirm their enormous wisdom and skill in the management of the land up till now. Thus the bill requires a management regime to be established under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. On top of this, the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council's operation continues to be controlled by the act, including the insulting requirement that spending decisions over $1,000 must be approved by the minister. I might add here that this is not money that is given by the government; this is the money they have earned in their own right. They require approval by the minister for any spending decisions over $1,000. Is this what the government means by self-determination? I will be moving an amendment later, in the committee stage, to eliminate this requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have listened to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community and understand that they want to see this bill passed.

The Queensland government has sought this measure to improve the accountability of the QIDC. The bill includes provisions complementary to Queensland legislation under which the Queensland government transferred its constitutional banking power as it relates to the state financial institutions, in this case the QIDC, to the Commonwealth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing this bill but I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the bill is not without some controversy in Queensland itself. The reason is that the Goss Labor government in Queensland, when it passed complementary legislation last year for the QIDC to be brought under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank, gave assurances that the QIDC would not become a bank. However, declaring the QIDC a bank under section 5 of the Commonwealth Banking Act will give it a complete range of banking powers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Marks Bill 1995 repeals and replaces the Trade Marks Act 1995 and the Trade Marks Act 1994. The bill derives from an exposure draft of the Trade Marks Bill 1994 which the government released, and on which it invited public comment, in February 1994. The 1994 bill sought to implement the government's response to the July 1992 report of the working party to review trade marks legislation, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recommended changes to the Australian trade marks legislation</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the results of public consultation could be included, the government decided to introduce the Trade Marks Bill 1994 as part of the package of legislation enacted last December to ensure that Australia met its obligations under the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation. However, in so doing, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) indicated that the government would amend the new act at the earliest opportunity to incorporate the results of that process of consultation. Due to the extensive nature of the changes that would be necessary to amend the Trade Marks Act 1994, the government has decided that it is now simpler and more convenient to repeal the 1994 act and replace it with a new consolidated bill which we now have before us. The Trade Marks Act 1994 has not yet come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a new and wider definition of a trade mark. As a result, it will now be possible to register sounds, smells and aspects of packaging as trade marks provided that all other requirements are met. The bill also streamlines existing procedures under the trade marks system. In particular, it is proposed to introduce a system of multi-class applications which will eliminate the need for separate applications for each class of goods or services for which registration is sought. In addition, the bill includes simplified provisions for recording the assignment of trade marks and a more streamlined method of removing unused trade marks from the register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the 1994 act, the bill proposes that the distinction between part A and part B of the trade marks register be removed. Under the existing system the register is divided with trade marks registered under part B accorded more limited rights than those in part A. There were a number of members of the 1992 working party who recommended retention of a divided register and, according to the minister's second reading speech, a minority of submissions to the working party also supported that view. Nevertheless, the government has opted to pursue a unified register with all trade marks accorded the same level of protection currently afforded by part A registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the bill differs from the 1994 act, mainly in matters of clarity and technical detail, there are two key areas of more substantive difference which are worthy of comment. Firstly, whilst the 1994 act sought to streamline existing provisions dealing with associated trade marks, the new bill proposes to do away with the concept of associated trade marks altogether. According to the minister's second reading speech, this measure is in line with submissions received during the public consultation process and is consistent with the situation in most other industrialised nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of more substantive difference from the 1994 act is that the new bill does not include provisions relating to the registration of the use of the trade mark by a person other than the trade mark owner. Instead, the bill provides for use of trade marks by persons other than the registered owner provided that the owner retains control over the use of the trade mark. According to the government, the World Trade Organisation agreement does not require use under control of the owner to be registered and, consequently, it is said there is little benefit in retaining additional provisions for the registration of users. The change also simplifies existing legislation by eliminating part 11 of the 1994 act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the bill. It is, for the reasons I have outlined, one that we think improves the situation. It clarifies the situation in relation to trade marks and therefore is to be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some very brief comments, not in relation to the technical detail but to the processes involved in arriving at the point we have reached today. In essence, the Trade Marks Bill 1995 is an update of the Trade Marks Bill 1994 which was passed into law by the Senate last December. The bill we dealt with then was part of a very large package of trade bills which were introduced in order to enable Australia to accept the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, which was an agreement to which the government was very keen to be a founding signatory. The Democrats did not agree with the rush to sign the World Trade Organisation agreement because of the blind faith it puts in free trade ahead of fair trade. But that is now a past debate; that is past history. We are in there, although I believe the consequences have not yet been fully felt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 Trade Marks Bill was drafted so as to be consistent with standards and principles prescribed for trade marks contained in the WTO agreement. It replaced the Trade Marks Act 1995 and was due to come into effect on 1 January 1996. However, in the rush to enable us to sign the WTO agreement, the government was actually forced to table and have the parliament pass an exposure draft of the bill, with which we are currently dealing. The exposure draft became the Trade Marks Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we now have, the Trade Marks Bill 1995, is the final, completed version of the bill. It has been updated to reflect the outcome of consultation with the trade marks community, and it will repeal and replace last year's bill. This final bill represents the culmination of a process which began as long ago as March 1989 when the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, authorised a working party comprising representatives of the Trade Marks Office, the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia and the Law Council of Australia to review and streamline the trade marks legislation. That working party released a discussion paper for public comment in July 1991 and its final paper, glamorously called, `Recommended changes to the Australian trade mark legislation', in July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that point, there came the draft legislation. It was widely circulated and an extensive process of consultation occurred under the auspices of the Trade Marks Office. The bill does reflect that consultation. I believe that the government is to be congratulated for the considerable amount of work and discussion and participation that has gone into developing the bill to this stage&mdash;if only it happened all the time. In particular, I would like to congratulate the Trade Marks Office, which made sure that it did happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have 100 per cent agreement on the final bill, but it certainly is very widely accepted. The major problem, as we see it, is the inclusion of aspects of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent in the definition of a trade-markable sign. We understand this is included to make the legislation consistent with what is described to us as international practice. It seems, however, to the Democrats that adding aspects of packaging, shape, colour, sound or scent to the definition of a trade-markable sign only adds to a marketer's capacity to capture market share by gaining control over forms of sensory manipulation, rather than forcing them to provide anything more concrete by way of producing something really new or valuable. Manufacturers and marketeers will have their products protected by labelling and other definitions in this bill. We do not believe that they need any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have arrived at this position because, despite receiving assurances from the Trade Marks Office that they do not intend this bill to be adventurous with new definition&mdash;assurances which we do accept&mdash;the fact is that the final decisions on these matters will be made in the courts and that is a process that we do not particularly want to trigger off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That issue aside, we support the bill. People within the trade mark community are ready to proceed under the new system. We do believe that adequate processes and safeguards are in place to protect both consumers and traders and that, as I said before, the consultation process has been comprehensive. We therefore recommend this bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction of this bill is not opposed by the opposition. It will modernise the trade mark regime. The current regime was enacted in 1955, some 40 years ago. It would be noted by even the most casual observer of trade and technology that there have been significant developments in the intervening 40 years. This bill has its genesis in the research undertaken by the working party to review trade marks legislation. The working party reported in 1992. The government, in response, produced a draft exposure bill two years later which, in effect, implemented the government's response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the public consultation was still in progress, the government decided to introduce the Trade Marks Bill 1994. It undoubtedly did this because of its self-perceived need to fulfil its obligations to the World Trade Organisation. However, the public consultation process resulted in so many amendments that the government, quite properly, decided to, in effect, withdraw the 1994 bill and proceed with this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the welcome features of this bill include: a wider definition of trade marks, to include sounds, smells and aspects of packaging as trade marks; and the streamlining of existing procedures, including a system of multi-class applications. There is other material on the public record about this bill which does not need to be repeated. I note that the bill will eliminate provisions that may have the effect of diluting the level of accountability between owners and other users of trade marks. Time will tell as to how these changes will work in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst discussing the Trade Marks Bill 1995, I wish to express my concern at the way the Trade Marks Office has dealt with a particular constituent of mine in Tasmania, a Mr Roger Coates, who had the name `Tarkine Tours' registered by the Trade Marks Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of answers to questions placed on notice at the last Senate estimates committees, we have confirmation that the Trade Marks Office does not register names that are geographic names, and that geographic names do not qualify as trade marks pursuant to paragraph 24(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no difficulty with that. That makes sense; it is reasonable and proper that that be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I want to raise this matter is that `Tarkine' is not the recognised name of a geographic area within my home state of Tasmania. It was a name invented by certain elements within the green movement to try to establish some credibility for having the Arthur-Pieman region of my home state listed on the Australian heritage list. It clearly was a propagandistic name and had no geographic basis whatsoever. Indeed, the Tasmanian Nomenclature Board did not recognise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Marks Office itself, of course, did not recognise it, and that is why it initially allowed the registration of that name. Indeed, they say that, during examination, the normal geographic references were searched. So all the normal ones were searched and, of course, `Tarkine' did not come up. No entry was located to indicate that `Tarkine' failed to qualify as a trade mark because of its identity as a geographic name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then, undoubtedly, certain pressures were brought to bear, because of the federal government's pursuit of having the Arthur-Pieman region in my home state listed. This region is one where there have been townships of in excess of 2,000 people, and where considerable mining, agriculture and forestry operations have taken place, over many decades. So, to try to beef up the claim to have this listed on the Australian heritage listing, a new name had to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A name was then developed by picking on a version&mdash;not even a proper name but a version of a name&mdash;of the name of an Aboriginal band that lived in the area. They were the Tarkinimma band, and theirs was only one of very many bands that traversed the area which is known as the Arthur-Pieman region. Indeed, they were mainly coastal Aboriginals, only went round to about 10 miles inland and, basically, survived on seafood. But, in insisting that they wanted to get some good-sounding name, the name `Tarkine' was used by those supporting the listing of the Arthur-Pieman region, so they tried to call this area `the Tarkine region'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Trade Marks Office has unwittingly and quite foolishly embroiled itself in a debate that it need not have involved itself in by saying that, just because certain green elements in the community have renamed an area as Tarkine, that, of itself, has some geographic value all of a sudden. The Trade Marks Office people told me in the answer that they provided that information came to light that Tarkine does have geographic value. It is used to denominate an area of wilderness&mdash;once again, they have made a value judgment that it is wilderness; how and why they have done that, I do not know&mdash;in north-west Tasmania between the Arthur and Pieman Rivers. Of course, in Tasmania the area between the two rivers which are mentioned is known as the Arthur-Pieman region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems quite astounding that the Trade Marks Office should involve itself in determining that this area is somehow a wilderness when the area has roads, mines, sawmills and townships in it. The area is not the sort of wilderness that the listening community in the gallery might expect to be described as wilderness when there are all these interventions and human activity in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Marks Office made an unfortunate decision to involve itself in a heated political green debate over the use of a name when clearly that name, as yet, has not been gazetted or placed on the Nomenclature Board listing. The name has no basis other than for propagandistic purposes by those who are trying to list another part of my home state on the Australian Heritage Commission list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope and trust that the experience the Trade Marks Office has had in this particular situation will make it less anxious to adopt propagandistic terms as geographical names and that it thereby cancels trade mark names that they have approved. If the normal research that the Trade Marks Office undertakes does not disclose the name, one wonders why they should then undertake further research only to find out that somebody is now calling an area by a different name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Marks Office could well find itself in great difficulty. All you would have to do is to get a local shire council or something of that nature to start to refer to an area by a different name than that which is on a map or in the Nomenclature Board and then tell the Trade Marks Office, `Look, sorry. The people in this town refer to this area by a particular name and, therefore, this particular trade mark ought be cancelled.' It sets a very dangerous precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope and trust that there was not inappropriate political involvement in the Trade Marks Office when it came to its determination. If there was not inappropriate political intervention, then the officers concerned ought reflect on the way they handled this matter. They ought consider their actions for the future to ensure that genuine people who want to get about their business are not confronted by having their trade marks cancelled simply because certain minority groups within the community wish to rename an area without either the approval of the people of that area or of the state concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This area of trade marks comes under the heading of intellectual property, which has more importance than most people would realise. The question of trade marks is relevant both to the consumer and to the business involved, particularly small businesses which perhaps use trade marks more often in the course of their daily commercial activities. A trade mark is a word or symbol used to identify the trade source of goods or services. Thereby the consumer relies on that, and the vendor or the retailer relies on that mark as being something which is identified in the marketplace and something upon which that business hangs its hat in order to sell its goods. As I said, it is part of the area of intellectual property where you have such things as designs, patents and trade names. Sometimes it is hard to define the differences between them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common law recognised the action of passing off, which is a situation where you pass off someone else's goods as your own. There was an action allowed to an individual, based on either deceit or false pretence, in relation to that. It was allowed for very good reasons, because someone had the thought and went to the effort of coming up with a design or a trade mark and, of necessity, had to have protection for having endeavoured to come up with that. Similarly, the consumer needed that protection because the consumer needed to know that what he or she was buying was in fact that article which was for sale and was not the property of another person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Trade Marks Bill 1995 repeals and replaces the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Trade Marks Act 1994. The coalition is aware of the problems being faced by the owners of registered trade marks and the complexity of issues arising from the sale of Australian products in an ever increasing international market and, therefore, does not oppose the bill. As previous speakers have mentioned, this bill came about as a result of Australia's obligations under the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation and, in particular, the sub-agreement entitled `The agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights'. This is an aspect where perhaps an international instrument is of great value domestically to Australia because, in this sense, it provides a minimum standard for intellectual property protection&mdash;thereby protecting Australian products, I believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition, as has been mentioned previously, has been widened. I understand from the paper done by the parliamentary library that the current definition did have its problems. The present definition which is contained in the Trade Marks Act 1955 has limitations because it does not expressly convey the requirement that the trade mark must be distinctive. Also the definition is ambiguous because it refers to a connection by an infringer with the owner of a registered trade mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, clause 17 of this bill remedies those defects, and allows for signs which can include a shape, colour, sound or scent provided that the identifier can be represented graphically. Under the new definition, these features of a product will be protected, and I think that is to be applauded. The new definition is simple and easily understandable. In fact, I would compliment the drafters of this bill in the setting out of the explanatory guide at the beginning of the bill, and then the flow chart, done by way of an appendix, which sets out how to obtain the registration of a trade mark. I believe that that is an innovation which the Commonwealth is using more and more these days, and it is one which I applaud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill generally seeks to streamline the process for registration of trade marks, and introduces a system of multi-class applications which will eliminate the need for separate applications for each class of goods or services for which registration is sought. That, too, is a good thing. It removes the distinction between types of trade marks. At present, you have two categories A and B, and the bill removes that distinction and accords all trade marks the same protection at the higher level under the old system. That also is a reform. I understand that the financial impact of this bill will not be great by means of implementation, but the gains that remain to be enjoyed by the business community, and the consumers of Australia in general, are very great indeed. I support wholeheartedly this bill, as does the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of those areas where it is simple for a person to become submerged in the complexities of the legislation and find they have accepted the reasoned and basic view. It is useful, from time to time, to surface and look at what the act does and why. Trade marks have one primary function which is to distinguish the product of one manufacturer from the product of others. There are two reasons to do this. One is because a person may want people to know that the product is yours so that, if they like it, they can buy it again. It is a basic method of ensuring that, when a producer puts the time and effort into a product to make it a good product, consumers can identify that product and buy it again. It protects the interests of producer and consumer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fairly simple and straightforward issue. A label or some other identifying mark can be used that means customers can find that product when they look. Note that this is an interactive definition that assumes the customer is an active agent who pays attention to signs and seeks out products they like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for having a trademark is so that a person can take a product which is little different from any other, or of little inherent value, and promote it through advertising using the full range of psychological marketing techniques. This allows those with a lot of money to develop an image which they sell and with which they try to convince customers that they can partake of this image if they buy the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the producer wants to protect their investment in marketing by assuring that no-one with an essentially identical product can cash in on their image creation. The consumer is seen as a passive person to be led and the issue is that the people with big bucks who spend it in marketing do not want other people leading the sheep they have created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to the first case, the one the moral argument for trade marks rests upon, we would have to say that where a product is functionally superior&mdash;whether that means it works better, tastes better, smells better or makes your cat happier&mdash;people will look at that product, identify it for themselves and seek it out. If there is a similar product that is not as good, they will remember that as well. As long as there is a label of some sort, the consumer will do the differentiation. All that is needed is that label. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the marketing tools, specially shaped bottles, scented thread or whatever are irrelevant. The consumer will still look for the label and buy the product they want. All that is required to protect producers from fraud is the establishment of a clear label as a trade mark. The only time consumers will not look for and buy according to quality and price is where they have been convinced that some product is somehow better, cooler or sexier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advertising can override good sense. This is where the image issue comes in. Coca-Cola is often used as the classic example of packaging or shape being used as a trade mark. Coke argues that they have created such a strong identification with the shape of the coke bottle that, if anyone else uses that shape bottle, they would lose business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this says to me is that there is effectively no inherent difference between coke and other cola drinks and that, if someone makes the mistake and buys Pepsi Cola, they would not know the difference. Because they would not notice a difference, they might not pay any attention to whether a thing is Coke or Pepsi. Coke might lose sales. If, Ricardo forbid, it were not Pepsi, but Amrit Cola in Bombay, or Black and Gold from the supermarket sold at half the cost, people might buy Amrit or the generic brand because it is cheaper, as long as they can still partake of the whole hip, cool image that has been marketed effectively independent of the qualities of coke as a drink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong with this? I do not think anyone would argue that because the bottle looks similar, people do not know that they are buying Black and Gold, or that they are buying it by mistake, really wanting Coke. If we assume that the consumers can and do differentiate, then the labels on the front are working. So what is the problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those billions Coke spends to get Michael Jackson or Madonna to do Coke ads is the problem. Coke has gone to a lot of trouble to create the impression, basically a false impression, that Coke is something special, something different, even though it tastes about the same. They have gone to a lot of trouble to make people think that, if they drink this fantastic substance, they will live in fast forward with the beautiful and fit people doing exciting things and dancing all day, that they will be sexy and desirable, socially active and have attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Asia, marketing goes even further, pushing the idea that you will not only do all the things above, but you will live essentially as Americans, and not just any Americans, but like rich people from New York or Hollywood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is that, while a label is enough to ensure that consumers can identify a product, it may not be enough to exclude others from all the benefits of this marketing. But is the reason for trade marks to exclude others from marketing of products, like coke, which are in fact no better than most other products&mdash;products which are unnecessary, unhealthy and which cost a lot? And this is a real issue amongst the poor and among developing countries. There is evidence in many countries that the aggressive marketing of cola drinks has been so successful that people buy these products, which are very expensive relative to their income, and that they buy these products to try to give some part of the image which was created to their children. They buy them at the expense of food. It is a phenomenon known as cola malnutrition syndrome. Another famous case is the marketing of powdered formula by Nestle in Africa, which led to consumer boycotts worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marketing is the sort of thing that lets tobacco companies promote their products as youthful, beautiful, healthy, liberating, sexy. The Marlboro man&mdash;cool, freedom and the ad that tells women `You've come a long way, baby.' A long way, indeed, now you can be targeted for aggressive marketing and psychological image creation, need creation, wrong association, in an effort to sell you something that will empty your pocket and rob you of your health. Marketing is the sort of thing that ensures that teenagers want a pair of $100 Nike or Adidas shoes made in Indonesia for $1 per pair, rather than the virtually identical non-famous brand shoes that sell for a quarter of the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this type of image creation, labels are not enough. Coke wants the shape of its bottle. The image people want to create a multiple level of image and sensory association&mdash;shape, colour, smell, tactile cues&mdash;any hook to get you in. They want to create a complex set of cues and images to push a product more effectively, where effectively there is likely to be no inherent difference in the product, and often no reason for anyone to buy the product, or an entire class of products&mdash;such as cigarettes or cola drinks&mdash;which have no inherent benefit at all. There may be significant health and environmental reasons not to buy the product, which the marketing seeks to override. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But is it not consumer choice? Don't people like things such as coke or candy just because they like them, even if they are not good for them? I am reminded of the joke where a young boy blows out the birthday candles and is asked, `What did you wish for?' `I want to have periods.' `What! Why?' `So I can use tampons and go sailing, mountain climbing, surfing and horse riding!' It is an insight of humour that the needs created have virtually nothing to do with, and will never be satisfied by, the product promoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we want often has nothing to do with what we buy. It has to do with the image and needs that have been created. Not only are the things pushed often bad for you, or for the environment, but the whole push to consume, consume, consume, is inherently bad for the environment. It leads to unsustainable use of resources and an immense social overemphasis on consumption and image, superficial qualities that blind us to the real qualities in ourselves and the people around us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this what parliament wants to promote and protect with this law? There are also other issues in relation to sensory labels, and especially shape and aspects of packaging. Currently, there are other laws addressing intellectual property in design. Where it is inherent as a unique and intrinsic quality of a new product, an innovation, design can be patented. Where it is only a special shape, design law applies. But both of these have limits. Why do we now need to include shape here, in trade marks with an unlimited time frame?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs argues that it is only for the marketing but, currently, there are huge disputes around design laws about the use of design, such as auto parts designed to create effectively monopoly markets in areas such as auto spare parts. The danger I see is that, in extending trademarks explicitly to shape and aspect of packaging, we open the door for claims of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who run trade marks and make the decisions have spoken to us and they have probably spoken to others. I have little doubt that they have integrity, recognise the dangers and will, as they say they will, exclude such claims. But the law will remain and they may not be there forever to make good decisions. Also there will be more and more appeals, where companies with a lot of money can see tremendous advantage if they create monopoly conditions through shape trade marks. </PARA>

The Prime Minister has in the past discussed human rights questions but the subjects that he discusses with him are not set by the media, and the Prime Minister is not inclined to preview the course of his talks in public.

Indeed, it makes a joke and a total mockery of the jibe by the opposition leader, Mr Howard, about five minutes of economic sunshine. We have in fact had many years of economic sunshine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good story here is that the Australian economy is continuing to grow, and grow on sustainable growth paths. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of growth; that is to say, four consecutive years of economic growth for Australia. It equals the record since quarterly estimates commenced in 1959; that is to say, a record not surpassed for 3 1/2 decades. It is a record and an achievement of which Australia, Australian business and Australian workers can be proud. It is a record for all Australians to be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government does recognise that some people are still doing it tough out there, this sort of sustainable growth represents the light at the end of the tunnel for many of them. You can only get rising living standards across the board if you get this sort of sustained economic growth. You certainly will not get it by sitting back and denigrating the efforts of Australian business, by producing artificial rhetoric about the battlers and without any policies whatsoever, as is the case with the opposition, to deliver any sort of economic outcome. You will not get it by the blundering doorstop interviews that Peter Costello, the shadow Treasurer, did yesterday in which he made a complete goose of himself by not being able to answer direct reporters' questions on the state of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the figures in the national accounts and see what we have from yesterday's publication. We have continued strength in consumer demand. Business investment is up 16 per cent in year average terms. Business profits are up four per cent. Household incomes are up six per cent. Inflation continues to hover at a low level, around 2 1/2 per cent. These are all figures and achievements of which Australians, as I said, should be proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of business investment growth over last year has been particularly pleasing. In 1994-95, plant and equipment investment grew by a record 21 per cent and, as Moody's, the international rating agency, has said:</PARA>

It was certainly the case in Tasmania that when Mr Gray went off on a collateral frolic to challenge the jurisdiction of the Rouse royal commission, that tab was picked up by the government in question.

I would presume someone who takes an interest in this matter, like you do, would take an objective interest and maybe take into account the comments made by the federal government's most senior law enforcement officer when he says with respect to Operation Gallon that there were arrangements that governed the release of information there, relations that go very much to the operational processes between law enforcement agencies and, as a consequence, as often happens, some information could not be made available because it would bring into question our relationship with other law enforcement agencies in other operations.

Through the ASC the government has developed a number of participation initiatives that are aimed at increasing participation and indirectly the health and well-being of Australians. In particular, I would like to highlight the Aussie sports program, which has made a significant contribution to the sporting programs and experiences of Australian children at school and in their local school sports clubs. It has an emphasis on fun and skill development, rather than just targeting those children who have particular natural sporting abilities.

I asked Senator Alston at the beginning of question time what the state of play was and what the opposition's intentions were in this respect. He said, `Well, because of what happened yesterday, we reckon that we are entitled to some more questions. We want to ask of you 28 questions, including supplementaries.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Senator Crowley, your government is spending $12.5 million on an advertising campaign funded by the taxpayer to push the benefits of superannuation. Mr Keating has gloated that an average wage earner joining the work force now would retire with nearly half a million dollars in superannuation. How much would the average woman who works for 25 years, not the 39 years of the average man, and at 85 per cent of male earnings, have in her superannuation when she retires? Aren't you simply conning Australian women? Isn't this why Eva Cox has described your superannuation policies as neither fair nor equitable for women? Would you like me to repeat it because you couldn't hear it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. I refer to the release on Tuesday of the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index. I understand this small business index reflects information gained from a survey of 1,000 randomly selected small business proprietors from all metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions of Australia. Has the minister been able to consider the survey results? If so, do the results provide any indication of the strength of the economic recovery?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Childs for his question. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index is a credible index. Every quarter it samples 1,000 metropolitan and regional small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. The one that came out earlier this week showed some very good signs for the economy, which also back up the accounts figures which were released yesterday, as we well know. It showed that confidence remains relatively strong across the sector. Small business confidence is higher in the recreation and personal service sector. Expectations for growth are relatively stable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant to note that interest rate concerns have fallen substantially, with only two per cent of respondents expressing concern, compared with eight per cent in February and six per cent in May. Over half of the respondents expect to increase sales over the next 12 months and expect inflation to be at about four per cent during the next 12 months. They have expectations for employment growth in the current quarter, and that has firmed slightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are, again, a clear sign that the government's economic policies, both at the macro and the micro level, are working very well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. According to the most recent Bureau of Industry Economics report, Australia's waterfront efficiency is at the bottom of the list of 18 when compared with Asia, Europe and North America. The principal Australian ports of Melbourne and Sydney are in fact rated 17th and 18th. Doesn't this make a mockery of WIRA reform, and doesn't this report reflect the abject failure of the government's attempt to reform the waterfront and require Mr Brereton to resign, as you should have in 1992?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it the case that the countries of the OECD, with the exception of Australia and Canada, are seeking to phase out the non-recyclable use of lead by the year 2005, and that Australia and Canada are resisting this proposal? Does the government accept that lead is a cumulative poison that has particularly damaging effects on the intellectual development of children, and that any continuing non-recyclable use of lead adds to the total burden of lead in the environment? Does the government accept that, to the extent that it resists attempts to clean up the global environment, it leaves Australia with an increasingly tarnished reputation as well as outmoded industries which will inevitably become less profitable? Does this move by the government also presage an attempt to maintain the export of lead waste to Third World countries under the pretext of recycling it there?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia, along with other OECD countries, strongly supports cooperative action to reduce the risk of lead exposure. We support a flexible action program, which would include an industry initiative funded by the international lead industry. We proposed a ministerial declaration to demonstrate OECD members' continuing commitment to improving lead risk reduction measures, and to highlight the progress they have made on reducing risk to exposure to lead. There are other alternative policies that have been proposed. I will tell you more about them, in writing, at a later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. The number of Australians holding basic hospital cover has fallen by 98,000 in the last three months, which means only 35 per cent of Australians now carry private health cover. That brings the number of people who have dropped out of private health insurance in the past five years to 1.3 million. It is now predicted that by the year 2001 a mere 20 per cent of Australians will be covered by private medical insurance. Why have the number of people with private health cover continued to decline despite the changes passed earlier this year which you said would stem the flow out of private cover? How low will you allow the number of people carrying some private health cover to go before the public system falls over? What is the government now proposing to do to make private cover more attractive to Australians? Why was the Medicare levy increased in the last federal budget when the government says it is attempting to stem the flood of people leaving private insurance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can agree that the figures from 1991 have fallen from 43.7 per cent to 35 per cent in 1995. You ask why people have been leaving. People have been leaving health insurance for two reasons: one, because of the costs; and, two, because until recently private insurance entitled people to a very big bill. So people who used private health insurance found that it was not much help to them at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation that was introduced in this place has not really had time to make a difference to the private insurance numbers. But already a considerable number of agreements are in place between hospitals and insurance companies which mean that people will have 100 per cent cover for their hospital expenses. And if there are arrangements and negotiations between doctors and the insurance companies, that kind of 100 per cent cover for medical costs may also be provided to the patients who might have to use it. So it depends very much on what happens as a result of the negotiations still under way between the insurance companies and the medical communities. So far the doctors have started a vigorous campaign to reject any participation and, therefore, any opportunity to give patients 100 per cent cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of waiting and seeing how these insurance changes make a difference and bite into the community. The insurance companies are interested, the community is interested and the hospitals are participating on behalf of the people of Australia. Let's see if the doctors join them.</PARA>

Senator Harradine asked me what the government's forecasts for youth unemployment would be in the year 2001 after the Working Nation strategy had run its course.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, youth unemployment has always been higher than the overall unemployment rate because the turnover of young workers is greater than for the overall labour force, resulting in a larger pool of workers between jobs. However, under Working Nation, the government has committed the resources and provided the program flexibility to skew the labour market equation in favour of young people and ensure that they share in sustained jobs growth. The evidence is there. Over the year to July 1995, the number of young people seeking full-time employment fell by five per cent. For long-term unemployed 15- to 19-year-olds, the number has fallen even further by over 20 per cent, and by 30 per cent for the 20- to 24-year-olds.</PARA>

<PARA>The issue of how the ATSIC board of commissioners came to the decision to award $20 million to the Northern Territory for land acquisition over the next two years while $4 million has been kept aside for emergencies or for land acquisition in the states is a very serious matter which deserves the deepest scrutiny of the Senate through our invaluable committee processes. As many senators are probably aware, yesterday the Federal Court in Sydney set aside the decision of the ATSIC board. In doing so, the judge made it very clear that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far from taking into account the Government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister that there not be an inappropriate increase in acquisitions of land in the Northern Territory, ATSIC did the opposite. It embarked upon a course which would ensure that this policy would, at least to the extent of some of $10 million allocated, be frustrated.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter has been the subject of a great deal of debate in this place and elsewhere. It has been raised in several ways, with very unsatisfactory responses so far from the government: during the land fund bill debate; during question time; calls to order; a successful censure motion against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Bob Collins; and in the estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Court judgment adds to the concerns expressed in the Senate and contrasts with the arguments which were raised by the government during those debates. The Federal Court action was taken against ATSIC by the New South Wales Land Council, the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre and FAIRA from Queensland. These three Aboriginal organisations felt deeply aggrieved by the decision of the ATSIC board and their position has been vindicated by the decision of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the decision of the court has far from settled the matter. There are a number of issues which have only been highlighted by the case. These can be summarised in the following questions: if there was a belief within ATSIC that there was an agreement with the government about giving special treatment to the Northern Territory, where did that belief come from? How did the ATSIC bureaucracy come to write the briefing paper on which the board based its decision? How did that briefing paper get the endorsement of the legal section of ATSIC if it was manifestly wrong? How did that briefing paper get the endorsement of the deputy CEO of ATSIC if it was manifestly wrong? How did the board of commissioners of ATSIC come to make such a manifestly unreasonable decision on such a sensitive matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways this is actually a very simple matter. There are really only two options about how this whole affair arose. The first option is that somehow the ATSIC bureaucracy managed to create a briefing paper on a highly sensitive matter which was manifestly wrong. In this case there is serious cause for concern about how such a briefing paper came into existence. The Senate committee should look at how the internal processes of ATSIC conspired to create such a brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second option is that the ATSIC briefing paper was right and there was an agreement with the government that the Northern Territory would be given special treatment for the next two years. In this case there has been gross deception on the part of the government and particularly the Prime Minister; a deception which resulted in the passage of a bill through this place; a deception which would rightly be called one of the most important wrongdoings by this government. I would like to quote from page 46 of Justice Hill's judgment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence before me of any discussions which would lead to the conclusion to which the author of the option paper, upon which the decision was based, came. This is not surprising. For there to have been such discussions and agreement with the Prime Minister, what the Prime Minister said in parliament would have to have been deliberately misleading. I would not lightly infer that the Prime Minister intended to mislead the House in this way. The fact that no evidence was called by ATSIC is also relevant to my conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators may ask why it is that I have continued to pursue this matter with such vigour and why it is that we keep making such serious allegations against this government. Senator Bob Collins and Senator Gareth Evans have accused me of having some kind of grudge against ATSIC or distaste of ATSIC. Far from this: anyone listening to the questions that I have asked will be able to recognise their legitimacy. If you take a close look at the evidence which we have been able to uncover, then this is really the only conclusion which one can honestly draw from the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No, we do not have any evidence which makes it explicit&mdash;not yet. The decision is the strongest evidence that we have. The need for a committee is to establish the basis on which a manifestly wrong paper came to be written. What we do have is a great deal of evidence which alludes to the fact that there was an agreement. ATSIC was a willing party in an agreement which was reached with a handful of people, including the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has a responsibility to look after the interests of all Australians. By setting up a statutory authority with a partially elected board of commissioners, the parliament did not abrogate our responsibility to the Aboriginal people of Australia. Indeed, ATSIC remains accountable to the parliament for its actions, just as it remains accountable to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Federal Court case, ATSIC attempted to argue the point of jurisdiction but failed. It ran its case on jurisdiction and the right of the Federal Court to make a determination. No evidence on merit was provided to the court. No evidence on merit was provided because, if it had, it may have exposed the Prime Minister. `We have no argument for the option paper being wrong' was the statement that was made. We don't have that argument. The inquiry which this motion seeks to set up will allow us to inquire into such matters and the questions I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that the government is still going to endorse this decision that has been set aside by the Federal Court. In order to be brief, I close with another quote from the Federal Court to remind us of the role of ATSIC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC exists to redress the imbalance of the past colonisation of the continent. To this end it is funded to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders acquire land. ATSIC does not exist for the purpose of furthering the interests of Aboriginal persons in a particular place. A decision by it, for example, that it would favour residents of a particular state or territory over residents of another state or territory would clearly be invalid. The residence of beneficiaries is not of itself a relevant factor. Where public moneys are made available for distribution to a particular group in society, in the present case, persons of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, it is necessarily implied that all persons within the class of beneficiary will be open to consideration for that benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that invitation in terms of the pompous self-delusion that you, Senator Chamarette, operate under. You talk about not having an anti-ATSIC agenda and you have prompted me to say that by that pompous interjection. I thought the interjection you made earlier today was quite extraordinary. I put to you today that you have an anti-ATSIC agenda. I put to you today that you have never given up an opportunity to boot ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that ATSIC is the most perfect organisation in the world, but it is the only one at the moment that actually has got a national democratic method of Aboriginal people electing its membership. Of course, as with all democratic institutions, there are many disaffected constituents in the Aboriginal community&mdash;as there are in the community at large with the people who elect these parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the difficulty you have, Senator Chamarette&mdash;and I put it to you fairly&mdash;is that you just cannot handle the concept of independent Aboriginal decision making. You simply cannot handle it. When Aboriginal people, for whatever reason, rightly or wrongly&mdash;I made my disagreement clear; I do not think I could have made it clearer&mdash;take a decision, it is a question of whether they are entitled to take it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I put that to you today and said, `Why are you always booting ATSIC and attacking ATSIC? What is wrong with ATSIC? Why can't people be represented through it?' I wrote down what you said in response. This is what you said in terms of the Greens' role in this parliament: `We speak'&mdash;that is, the Greens&mdash;`for all indigenous people who don't want to speak through this government.' Well, talk about self-delusion!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not presume to even speak about the situation that Aboriginal people are in anywhere else except the Top End of the Northern Territory&mdash;and I am very familiar with them. Senator Chamarette, they do not even know you exist. For you to take the mantle of the Greens in Western Australia and say that you are&mdash;and I quote again&mdash;`speaking for all indigenous people who do not want to speak through this government', just indicates the extent to which you are deluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You keep coming back to the one piece of evidence you claim does exist, and that is the minute. Just look at it through different eyes, Senator Chamarette. Instead of looking at it through your obsession, try to actually consider whether there is another explanation for that reference&mdash;and I know there is. You have simply distorted the words of that agreement. All those words in the minute refer to is the agreement that did exist between the Aboriginal people who met with the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister, which was given effect to in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the ATSIC legislation through here. Originally, the government had intended&mdash;as Senator Evans and I have stated again and again in here, and it was publicly known&mdash;that we would incorporate all of the land acquisition powers into the new body and that we would remove from ATSIC the continuation of the role it has played, and played very well, in acquiring land for Aboriginal people for some years. That was the original intention of the government. There are no bones about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was agreed to at those meetings with the Prime Minister, and I have spoken to the people who went to the meetings, was that the government would change that position; that the government would prevent the new body converting into inalienable freehold title the land that it had acquired but it would allow ATSIC to continue to have land acquisition powers as well for a transitional period. That was the agreement referred to in the minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you like to re-read the minute and cast away your obsessions for just a second, you will see that is in fact the explanation for what the so-called agreement refers to. There is no other evidence, Senator Chamarette. At no time, and you have said it yourself, have you found any. You want this Senate to waste more time on a fishing expedition&mdash;and you have admitted it yourself&mdash;to try to find it, and it does not exist, solely on the basis of what is said in this minute paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is despite the fact&mdash;you have quoted a bit of him, and I will quote a bit more of him&mdash;that, with all of the processes of the Federal Court at play, the judge, Mr Justice Hill, found there was no evidence in his court that such an agreement had existed. We have provided you with endless answers to questions without notice and to questions in the estimates committees. A huge pile of documents&mdash;six kilograms of them, as I understand it&mdash;were given to you, and there is nothing in any of that which indicates that this obsession you have is justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Cathcart is writing a book. I understand the working title is `Mabo: the real story'. Father Frank Brennan has just published a superb book on Mabo. I commend it to anyone who wants to read the best exposition of what the actual judgment says and an interpretation of what I think is a passage for reconciliation in Australia. But I have to say that I get a bit irritated knowing that that six kilograms of paper is going to be used by Cathcart to write his book and that this Senate is to hold Senate inquiries to provide him with a bit more material for his book. If that book includes as its central element the proposition that this deal existed, it will not be the true story at all about Mabo. The story will be false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to draw to the attention of the Senate the comments made by Mr Justice Hill. I read the judgment last night, and it is a very interesting judgment indeed. I will quote from page 46 a little more extensively than Senator Chamarette did. Mr Justice Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC also erred in taking into account what it took to have been the outcome of discussions with the Government and as being the underlying rationale for parallel programs, namely that there should be special treatment for the Northern Territory through grants by ATSIC in the two years before the "sunset" period. There is no evidence before me of any discussions which would lead to the conclusion to which the author of the option paper, upon which the decision was based, came. This is not surprising. For there to have been such discussions and agreement with the Prime Minister, what the Prime Minister said in Parliament would have to have been deliberately misleading. I would not lightly infer that the Prime Minister intended to mislead the House in this way. The fact that no evidence was called by ATSIC is also relevant to my conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems abundantly clear that ATSIC saw its task to be to set aside the maximum funds it could (after providing for land maintenance) and allowing only for $2 million for special acquisitions so as to give effect to a belief that this was Government policy when it was clearly expressed not to be so. In my view, in the circumstances, the Commission erred either by taking into account an irrelevant consideration (the supposed discussions which I infer did not reach the suggested conclusion) or by failing to take into account a relevant consideration (the real Government policy) as well as by coming to a decision that in all the circumstances was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could come to it.</PARA>
<PARA>There was endless opportunity for the plaintiffs to present in the Federal Court the evidence that Senator Chamarette still insists exist, which it does not, but it was not produced. The judge in his judgment clearly said there was no evidence before him that any such arrangement did exist. I must say this: it does not exist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why didn't the plaintiffs produce it if they suggested it existed? It was produced by no-one in the Federal Court. Read the judgment. You can try to politicise the judge's decision all you like, but it is there in black and white. In fact, it could not be clearer. The Federal Court found there was no such conspiracy, but Senator Chamarette still will not agree. I know that she is desperately trying to help Cathcart's book, but I say again, if he wants to call it `Mabo: the real story' he had better not have this as its central element because that will not be the truth, it will be a lie. Those individuals I spoke to confirmed to me no such deal had occurred. The ATSIC board made its own decision about how it would allocate its funds, and the basis of the board's decision was set out in the chairperson's press release on 11 April.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point needs to be made. I said in the Senate when this matter was first raised, when we were taking the legislation through the Senate, that I did not believe that the ATSIC board would actually make this decision. This was to the aggravation of the land council, and I have never ever hesitated to aggravate them if I thought that something needed to be said. They were aggravated by what I said but I made my own personal position on that decision very clear. I was entitled to do that but not to interfere with that decision in the sense of causing the government to direct them to change it. It was open&mdash;and I said this&mdash;to the disaffected people to take action. They have, and they have a judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem you have, Senator Chamarette, is you cannot handle the concept of Aboriginal people, the ones you do not agree with, making decisions and having the right to make them without interference. You wanted them directed to do otherwise by the government. The New South Wales land council took the course open to it. It is a public fact that the decision was a controversial one inside the commission. All that is public. It was a tied vote. It was hotly contested inside the commission. On that day the New South Wales land councils did not get up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made my judgment in here, and it was an opinion I expressed, that it would not happen based on the internal politics of the organisation. What I did not allow for, of course, was the well-known persuasive powers of territorians against the odds. They persuaded others to take a different decision but it was hotly contested and the vote was tied. The New South Wales land council, Senator Chamarette, then took action available to it and got a judgment, and they are entitled to do that. That does not mean we have to interfere in this process at all. That is what you cannot handle, Senator Chamarette. The ATSIC board made its own decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette, I did read this judgment last night. In respect of the central issue that you are pursuing&mdash;a deal which does not exist&mdash;it found very clearly there was not. But there are some aspects of his honour's judgment that I do find curious. If I were a lawyer I would not even hesitate to express this personal view I am expressing&mdash;and I read the judgment last night&mdash;but I am not a lawyer; I am just a mug politician. So any opinion I express on a legal matter is not worth a dam thing. As a mug politician I find aspects of this judgment quite curious. As the person who took the ATSIC legislation through the Senate chamber, one in particular I find very curious indeed, and I will refer to it. His Honour said, starting on page 42, that the applicants had two grounds of appeal&mdash;two. The first was this&mdash;and I am quoting from the judgment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First it is submitted that the decision of the commission to set aside in each of two years $10 million of the $12 million to be allocated in that year for land acquisition to persons seeking to acquire land in the Northern Territory was a decision so unreasonable in the administrative law sense that it amounted to an error in law.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough. He then went on to describe the second ground:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second ground relied upon was the failure on the part of ATSIC to take into account in determining the allocation of its funds government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, at the bottom of that same page, he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view the applicants should succeed on each of the submissions made.</PARA>
<PARA>So the judge found on two grounds: firstly, so unreasonable as to be wrong in law&mdash;fair enough&mdash;but the other, very curious, when he upheld it; that it was wrong because they had not taken into account government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister. The reason I find that curious is this: I took that legislation through the Senate. To the best of my knowledge there are no provisions in it that require ATSIC to take account of determining government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister. Not only is there not in my recollection any requirement of ATSIC to take account of government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister, but their charter, in fact, is to be independent of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an overriding power of direction from the minister to ATSIC to be taken in the last resort&mdash;a power I might add which he has never to the best of my knowledge ever exercised. If we had wanted an organisation&mdash;and I can safely say this in terms of the policy foundation of ATSIC&mdash;to take all of its decisions consistent with government policy announced by the Prime Minister, we probably would have kept the operations entirely within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, where that could easily have been accommodated. The reason the government&mdash;and this is a political point not a legal point&mdash;established ATSIC was deliberately to have a process where Aboriginal people could make decisions independent of the government and indeed, and it is a matter of public record, at times in conflict with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of public record that the chair and the board of ATSIC have on many occasions disagreed with the government, and we have had that out in the public domain. That is something we are very comfortable with. That is one reason why ATSIC was established&mdash;to allow Aboriginal people to express a view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not a lawyer. I might be absolutely up the creek on this one. Just as a lay person reading a judgment, I was fascinated that one of the grounds relied upon was `to take account of the obligation that ATSIC had to have regard to government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister'. I do not believe they have any such obligation. I do not believe there is any provision in the act&mdash;and I will check later&mdash;that requires them to do so. I found that a curious part of the judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, let me say that there is another section of the judgment that attracted my interest, where the judge placed great value on documents talking about ATSIC's obligations to be equitable in its distribution of grants. I say, again as a non-lawyer: does this mean that it has to be equitable in each and every year of the allocations? Can the equity be considered over a period, for example, of 10 years? I ask the question: would it be open to the ATSIC board to take a decision on land acquisition in one year which was deliberately designed to correct what they saw as the inequity of distributions in previous years? Is that necessarily inequitable? I do not think so. Is there a requirement for ATSIC year by year or allocation by allocation to be equitable, in that sense, on a yearly allocation? I am not sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are important questions in the judgment that need to be looked at. I do not know. I am curious about that in respect of the judgment. As I said before, the fundamental curiosity I have about the judgment is that, as one of the two grounds on which the judge said he relied for his decision, he relied upon a ground that the ATSIC board should have had regard to government policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister. I would like some lawyer who is smarter than I am to point out where in the act or anywhere else&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here to debate the motion of the Greens from Western Australia about the need for an inquiry into this matter. This matter is a very important one. When we first saw this legislation, we smelled a rat. We saw a convoluted scheme. We raised it prior to October, if I remember correctly; we raised it at the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in October; we raised it throughout the lengthy debate on this matter; and we raised it again, with some anger and vigour, when ATSIC announced its decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judgment does not refer to a deal. It was not a judgment about whether a deal was done.

On page 46, on another issue, the judge uses&mdash;of course, as you say, Minister, by way of interjection&mdash;the words `as there was no evidence before me', as he is required to do, and he talks about the `connivance' of the Indigenous Land Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important point. He says that the scheme, to be successful, if there was some discussion with the government, would require the `connivance' of the Indigenous Land Corporation. First, ATSIC has to make a decision to spend virtually all of its money in the Northern Territory, then it has to go to the ILC and say, `We don't want you to spend any of your money in the Northern Territory,' and the ILC then has to have a meeting and agree to do that. The judge has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It hoped&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he refers, of course, to ATSIC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the connivance, in this end, of the Indigenous Land Corporation. That corporation has not yet made any grant, nor, so far as the evidence before me emerges, has it reacted to the suggestion that it play its part in the connivance. It would be inappropriate for the Indigenous Land Corporation to assist in frustrating the evident policy behind section 191U.</PARA>
<PARA>That evidence&mdash;and we cannot question this judgment, I presume&mdash;was obviously not before the judge. But the senators who follow this debate and the poor public who are following this debate know very well that that evidence is before us, because back in June a press release was issued by the Indigenous Land Corporation saying that, indeed, they had. They would not have said they connived but, to use the judge's word, that `connivance' was given public airing. The first meeting of the ILC board was held and part of that connivance was agreed and published. Indeed, David Ross, now the chief of the ILC, held a press conference in this very building the day after and told the public of Australia that his part in the connivance had been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, of course, that was one bit of evidence that was not before this judge, before the Federal Court. Another piece of evidence that was not before the Federal Court was the so-called discussions with the government referred to in the minute. There may well not have been evidence before this Federal Court in relation to that matter. Senator Collins would have us believe that nowhere in the world is there evidence as to discussions with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are probably only one or two people who know about any so-called discussions with the government. Senator Collins gives what may well be a very valid reason why the person who wrote that minute or that briefing note described them as discussions with the government. It may be entirely innocent. But it is not innocent for those who will have, through this decision making process, their dispossession entrenched as a result of the scheme that was set up as a result of discussions with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This scheme emerged because of discussions with the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee proposed by Senator Chamarette to be established by way of this motion would seek to look at the establishment of that scheme and to look at the discussions that took place with the government. Quite clearly, the government and the Prime Minister have absolutely nothing to fear from this inquiry if there was no sort of connivance, if there was no sort of agreement, if there was no sort of discussion that would have led the person who wrote that minute to believe that the Prime Minister had not misled the parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at where we are. ATSIC made a decision. People expressed surprise and other emotions about the decision that was made to quarantine that amount of money over two years for the purchase of land in the Northern Territory. However, we have talked a lot in this place about self-determination. It is true, I think we should argue, that ATSIC had the right to make that decision in the same way as those who feel aggrieved by that decision had the right to appeal that decision. They did that. The Federal Court set the ATSIC decision aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that one sensible course of action would be for us to wait and see what ATSIC does now. We do not know whether ATSIC will appeal or whether the board of commissioners will revisit that decision. That is one option. It also seems to me that the numbers in this place are very close to deciding on some kind of inquiry. Perhaps we will get down to that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a bit of inconsistency when we have talked about self-determination in here. I vividly remember the disagreement we had in the land fund debate over whether self-determination meant that individuals should be allowed to purchase land and then sell it to others, thereby, I argued, undermining the amount of land to be held in the land stock. In terms of self-determination, it would affect the capacity of many other indigenous people to, for example, inherit that land. So you cannot be selective. It is okay in the case of that land fund debate for self-determination to exist to that extent, but it is not okay for it to exist as it applies to ATSIC's right to make a decision with which we may disagree. I really want to point that out. There has been some great inconsistency about whether we accept self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that there was disquiet about the decision. I acknowledge that we have a right to discuss how we should deal with that disquiet. My first option would be for ATSIC to have the opportunity to take whatever decision it chooses to next. The second point I would highlight is whether there have been adequate opportunities for those members of parliament, including those in the Senate, to scrutinise the material surrounding that decision. As I understand it, there has been a combination of numerous freedom of information requests, which have been complied with&mdash;those requests have been served on both the government and ATSIC&mdash;and many documents from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having had all those opportunities for scrutiny, the case has been taken to the Federal Court and the Federal Court set ATSIC's decision aside. We have to ask: what else are we going to achieve from another parliamentary inquiry? That is where I think the politics comes into it. I said when I began that I think we have inherited a lot of politics from the native title debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not unnatural. The native title debate saw the emergence of a new group of Aboriginal spokespeople. The crudest interpretation of it is that some who had been accustomed to speaking for Aboriginal people in a very public way did not really like this realignment. So we had two groups. That was unusual. Normally we have expected some monolithic view from indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the essence of this request for a committee inquiry, we have a continuation of the debate about the A-team versus the B-team, sovereignty versus non-sovereignty and whether ATSIC should incorporate the views of sovereignty. That is what it is. It is a continuation of Aboriginal politics. We should keep out of it. We should let them get on with sorting out the way they want to deal with these issues as in fact the New South Wales Land Council did in taking this issue to the Federal Court. That is a totally appropriate way to deal with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second layer of politics we have, which is a reality and which will continue to mirror things that we see in our own society, is the rivalry between the larger, more entrenched, more wealthy land councils who have had success in claiming a reasonable amount of land for their people because they happen to come from states where there is a lot of land able to be claimed. So we have a continuation of this. Again, I think we should stay out of that, except I agree with you on the matter of due process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is that, of itself, sufficient for us to warrant setting up a select committee? I do not think so. To answer some of the questions Senator Campbell raised about why he said it should be a select committee, it is not just a matter of cost but of course we should be conscious of the cost of all the committees we set up here. It is not just a matter of cost, for me it is a matter of appropriateness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember we had the debate. We said, `Let's include monitoring of the implementation of the land fund under the purview of the existing joint standing committee.' I remember saying at the time that it was a good idea because it is a flow-on from native title and those people will have expertise. I think it is good too that it is a joint committee because it means that those in the other house can also have input and be kept up to date with the monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is impractical&mdash;although I would be interested to hear from the chair of the committee, Senator Chris Evans&mdash;to send this matter to this committee in view of what Senator Chris Evans advised me when I consulted him: his committee is definitely able to deal with a reference to it without any great delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not persuaded that we need to set up another select committee. It is not my first preference. I believe we should wait and see how ATSIC deals with it. If we are to have a committee, it is the Democrats' preference that we refer a different term of reference to the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. I have given the Senate my reasons for that belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek to change the terms of reference to include part (a) only of Senator Chamarette's motion because I think it is appropriate to acknowledge the disquiet. But I want to exclude the assumptions of conspiracies, deceptions or whatever. I believe that it is much more appropriate to say that we note the continuing disquiet. Because section 206 of the Native Title Act says that it is appropriate to do so, we therefore refer part (a) only. We refer this matter to the committee for inquiry and report on or before 30 September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to walk away from scrutinising decisions of other bodies, but does this mean that if ICAC makes a particular decision against the New South Wales Land Council we then say that we want to look at that in here as well? When do we stop saying, `We want to have another look at these things as well'? I think there have been enormous opportunities for scrutiny. I believe we have had almost sufficient time devoted in this chamber in the last few years to important issues like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel a certain pressure now, Senator Harradine, by those remarks of yours, but I want to enter the debate purely to put a few comments on the record based on the role of the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fund, because it has been raised as an issue in this debate. I think it is appropriate to say that, in my view, if the numbers are in the Senate for this matter to be referred to a committee, then it is appropriate that the committee that was established by this parliament to be responsible for native title and, more recently, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land fund matters ought, some two months later, be given the opportunity to fulfil the role that we as a Senate decided it ought to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say that the committee did finalise its program for the year at a meeting the other day. There was nothing in that discussion that ruled out our ability to handle a reference of a piece of legislation or any other matter. Given the proposed reporting date of 30 September, I do not see there would be any difficulty in the committee dealing appropriately, and with responsiveness, to any resolution with that sort of deadline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did raise one matter with the committee about its workload towards the end of November, which related to my partner's expectation of our second child. I did make it clear that I was not too keen on our having hearing dates around that time, but the deadline of 30 September should allow us&mdash;barring any premature birth&mdash;to accommodate my duties there as well as to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that the committee so far has been a very good committee of the parliament. It has worked with consensus and has been able to put down two unanimous reports. I accept that this sort of political reference will challenge the committee's ability to maintain that consensus. But I do think the committee is building up a reputation as a positive influence in the debate in Aboriginal affairs. We are building up a rapport with many of the key players and a certain expertise both in the secretariat and in the members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, I think it is appropriate, therefore, that we continue the work. The reality is that, if a select committee is established, the same players&mdash;Senator Campbell, Senator Chamarette and I&mdash;will find ourselves in another guise doing the same job, so to that extent, I suppose, one could argue that it does not matter. But I am personally, as chairman, a bit disappointed that other members of the native title committee do not feel it can perform this function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that this was the role the parliament set for it&mdash;and we actually changed our name to include the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund only a month or two ago&mdash;it is quite clearly within our area of expertise and within our competence. If we have all been honest about this, I think this really comes down to an issue about whether or not the opposition or the government have the numbers on the particular committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine, I put to you that the difference between the reference going to the native title committee or the select committee is that, on the native title committee, the Labor Party has five members; the opposition, four; and the Greens, one. I suppose there is some concern that the government may use its numbers there. The proposition from Senator Chamarette provides for two nominations&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two out of seven provided by the Labor Party, three by the opposition, one by the Australian Democrats and one by the Greens or Senator Harradine. So, clearly, this is a question more about the numbers on the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no logical reason in terms of expertise, workload and cost. There is no justification for this reference to go anywhere else. I do not want to get too precious about it, because it is clearly about political numbers on that committee. I think that is a bit disappointing because I am sure the committee would be able to deal with the reference maturely and responsibly&mdash;if not continue the tradition of unanimous reports, but we would have to hear the evidence before we came to that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really about the politics of who has the numbers on the committee. Let us be honest about that. If the view is that, to have a proper committee in the Senate, the opposition and the Greens have to have the numbers, then so be it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to the amendments that have been proposed by Senator Kernot and Senator Harradine. First of all, I want to reply to the comments made by Senator Collins in his response on behalf of the government. I have no problems with groups of people making decisions that I do not agree with. I am more than happy for any group of Aboriginal people or non-Aboriginal people to make a decision, as long as it is a proper decision. What we are talking about here is a decision which was part of a debate and about which concern was expressed. The Federal Court set it aside, and it found that the ATSIC board decision in all the circumstances was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could come to it. I believe having a double standard for Aboriginal groups or non-Aboriginal groups is just as patronising and wrong as the kinds of implications and imputations that have been directed towards me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I affirm everybody's right to make decisions that they are entitled to make, but I believe that where they are subject to administrative law or to the courts they should be able to answer that scrutiny. Secondly, I agree that this parliament has not abrogated its role in the setting up of ATSIC in looking at the way government expenditure&mdash;about which we debated on a piece of legislation in this chamber&mdash;is dealt with. So I believe there is evidence, and I do not think it is fair to accuse me of some kind of grudge or inability to accept that Aboriginal people can make their own decisions. I have no problem with that. The implication of Senator Collins was that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins stated that the evidence does not exist and used that as the reason or proof that there was nothing to look at in this inquiry. If the evidence was not able to be produced to the Federal Court in those circumstances, we have to ask ourselves why. How could it be that the ATSIC CEO and the ATSIC legal officer could present a brief, which was the basis of this decision that has been set aside, to the ATSIC board that was so manifestly wrong? We have a responsibility to look at that, scrutinise it and set it up in such a way that the ATSIC board is not misinformed about government decisions, parliamentary decisions and its own options about which it can make its own decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Senator Collins said that ATSIC had no obligation to have a regard for government policy and that it has a right to be independent. He queried the implication that ATSIC should comply with the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. I quite understand that, but my understanding of the way it was referred to in the court judgment was simply to explain that the brief which was purporting to present an agreement made between ATSIC and the Prime Minister did not reflect something that the Prime Minister had said was government policy in the House of Representatives debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point was one that Senator Collins made about equity. He discussed the possibility that that can be seen over the long term and that we should overlook the inequity that is patently obvious in this decision because it might all even itself out. Senator Campbell's reference that there is a danger of being additionally conniving to perpetuate inequity needs to be looked at. I think he raised that point quite adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments against Senator Kernot's amendment, which I do not support, are four-fold. Firstly, the reason I believe that it is not appropriate is that it blurs the terms of reference, and it makes its inquiry and report by 30 September as the only basis for that committee to operate. Secondly, it suggests a joint committee rather than a Senate committee. I have had personal experience with difficulties of this Senate imposing terms of reference on a joint standing committee. I will not go into details, but I can assure you that a joint committee does not usually take very kindly to the Senate imposing terms of reference on it&mdash;as I found in the reference relating to women's representation in parliament to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I want to make&mdash;one that Senator Evans appropriately raised&mdash;is that I believe there is a reason that a Senate committee could be more appropriate than the joint standing committee. In political terms, because the government has the numbers on that standing committee and we are asking government members to be part of that committee that may well put them in a conflict of interest. If government members are expected to defend the hostile approach to these investigations that its representatives&mdash;namely, Senator Collins, Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Faulkner&mdash;during estimates have demonstrated, then I am not optimistic that a fair result will ensue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no concerns about Senator Chris Evans as the chair of the committee; it is more the political matter he raised about numbers. He can easily argue&mdash;and I will leave it up to the Senate&mdash;that, because a select committee might have the numbers that relate to the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens, we are using that. My point is that we are putting the government in an invidious position by taking a committee where it has the numbers and where it may have a particular view. As we are looking to matters that cast some question over the procedures of a government agency and also of the Prime Minister it would be better in terms of that accountability to have a committee that was swayed in the terms of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a precedent to my decision on the numbers in that I opposed a reference going to a select committee where the opposition had the numbers in a case where I felt there may have been a conflict of interest in those terms. It means that there is a balance on that committee, which cannot be accused of having been biased in the government's favour or of having covered up. I believe that committee will be able to address the matters that are brought before it in a way that cannot be compromised if they do come forward to clear ATSIC, the Prime Minister or the government of any difficulties in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point is that it may well be that the topic we are addressing is not best kept in the purview of the native title committee because the topic of this reference is to look at ATSIC, rather than the express purpose of the committee, which is to review the operation of the Native Title Act and the ATSIC Indigenous Land Corporation. If there is any ill-feeling engendered by this inquiry in relation to the topic under examination then it is best to set it up separately. </PARA>

I was dismayed yesterday to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> about the state of our waterfront. The headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> was `Waterfront reform too slow, study reveals' and the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> was `Report slams Australia's waterfronts'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to about 1991 we heard very much about Australia's waterfront reform where some $430 million or $450 million was allocated for this reform. Senator Collins, especially at the time he was Minister for Transport, told us how that waterfront was going to be really reformed and cleaned up. The $430 million or $450 million has been spent, but what have we got for it? Very little from what I can see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics report that I read yesterday referred to what is going on in the waterfront. The report is not yet released. It shows that Australia's waterfront standards still have a disastrous rating even by world standards. Today I asked Senator Collins a question on that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that that report was supposed to be released some time ago, but the minister has kept it under wraps. He has been going backwards and forwards because of the BIE review. The BIE review is the government's own review into what goes on in industry and our efficiencies. The matter has been going backwards and forwards so the authors of it would come up with better findings for the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this should sound alarm bells for the government. What has the minister decided? Not to release it. An example of what was said in that report can be found in the executive summary. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent declines in container stevedoring productivity has resulted in Australia falling well behind similarly sized overseas ports.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember, $430-odd million went in. Other examples I would like to quote in the short time we have left on this debate are from the body of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, rather than witnessing progress in waterfront productivity, the past year has seen some serious setbacks in crane rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall five port average fell between September 1993 and December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>Another item refers to the national transport planning task force document that was concluded at the end of 1994. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Users and operators also noted recent significant declines in workplace performance and questioned whether present levels of competition were sufficient to maintain the pressure for continuing improvement.</PARA>
<PARA>It is little wonder that the government has chosen to use out-of-date figures, as Mr Brereton did yesterday in the House of Representatives when he was answering a question from Mr Sharp, the shadow minister for transport. He used well out-of-date figures, yet he knows that that report is there and waiting for the government to deal with. That is all he could do. I think it goes somewhat towards misleading parliament if you know the report from BIE is there and yet quote out-of-date figures. That act speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give you another example. In regard to container productivity, most overseas ports have moved ahead while Australia has gone backwards. It has not even maintained that slight improvement it made for that $430 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened to that $430 million? Almost half of it was used to pay out wharfies to reduce the numbers on the waterfront. At that time, an average wharfie was earning $34,000 a year. At the beginning of this year, the same grade of wharfie was earning $75,000 a year. So under this government, under this restructuring, it went from $34,000 to $75,000. You could say that that could be part of the restructure and the benefits of the restructure. But about half of those who took the package of $100,000 are back on that wharf. The figures are here. That is a total disgrace. This restructure was supposed to have brought about improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the figures I found damaging was that it generally takes 50 per cent to 100 per cent longer to unload and load a container ship in Australia than in a comparable overseas port. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the lowest charges in Australia are equivalent to the more expensive ports of the west coast of North America.</PARA>
<PARA>Our lowest charges in Australia are equivalent to their highest. What situation does that put us in in relation to our export industry, which is Australia's income? One must bear in mind that this report has been prepared by the government's own body. It was not done by the coalition, it was not done by the NFF and it was not done by the Chamber of Mines and Energy. It was not done by anyone but the government itself. The government's own body has given it a report that damns its waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did Senator Collins do today? He just dodged the issue, just as Mr Brereton dodged it in the other place. If you cannot rely on the Bureau of Industry Economics, then whom can you rely on to give you an expert judgment on the waterfront, or indeed anything else? That report is there for everyone to read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newspaper articles on this report highlighted the survey of 18 common destinations, which rated Australia poorly in comparison to Asia, Europe and North America. We are always told when we compare our waterfront with Asia that Asia has cheaper labour, more labour, more of this, less of that and less of something else. I am willing to leave Asia aside, but to get a true comparison we have to compare ourselves with North America. That is the area we export to with our agricultural, mining and manufacturing exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It works both ways. Our exports to the rest of the world go through the wharves and we import machinery and all sorts of products. That is why our balance of payments is always blowing out. We go through the ports twice because, as well as exporting, we bring in machinery, fertiliser, chemicals and that sort of thing. We have to compare ourselves with the rest of the world. How can the government say that things are going well? By Collins's non-answer today?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report found that Australia's competitive cost standing did not change, despite the existence of the supposed shipping reform process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do find it strange that the Australian Soccer Federation, which professed great concern and great hopes that this inquiry would put the problems of soccer behind it and would get rid of all the innuendoes and attacks&mdash;I had hoped that would have been the outcome of our inquiry&mdash;by failing to take any action, even by way of gentle reprimand, has allowed a situation to continue so that people have certainly expressed to me the view that the Australian Soccer Federation did not care what the Senate inquiry came out with. In fact, this article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Sport</EMPHASIS> magazine, in a sense, criticises the ASF, particularly Mr Hill, the president, for having clearly given an indication that, whatever we came out with, he was pretty keen to reappoint the coach. I have no problem with the ASF reappointing the coach. All I do have a problem with is the assertion in this article that Mr Thomson should have been sacked on the basis of what a very distinguished former judge, Mr Stewart, had to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is that Mr Stewart's report rested heavily&mdash;and all the quotations in this article which say that Mr Thomson should be sacked rested heavily&mdash;on a lot of conditional words. They continually use words like `the perception' that something had happened, that he `may have' known, that the `implication' was, that there was a `strong inference' that he was doing it, and so on. I have had concerns about the level of response&mdash;and particularly this article&mdash;regarding what we have found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should stress that as far as I am concerned and, I believe, as far as the committee is concerned, this matter has not yet been finalised. There are other matters, particularly those relating, I regret to say, to the Institute of Sport, which are to be examined in the future and to which reference has already been made by some correspondents. I think it was Mr Michael Cockerill in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> who made some reference to the fact that the Australian women's coach is involved as an agent for some young Australian soccer players who have been training, and receiving the benefit of expensive training, I might say, from the Australian Institute of Sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter which obviously is of public concern. It has received considerable publicity.

The media, apparently, does not recognise that other matters of some substance emerged from this inquiry&mdash;for example, the pursuit of discrepancies. There was a discrepancy of something like $250,000 between what a Victorian club is alleged to have received as a transfer and what it is reported to have received. That sort of matter has been referred to the Victorian police because it is not a matter properly for examination by the Senate committee. </PARA>

In other words, there has been a response to our report which seems to me to be unreasonable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's response to the 13th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is indeed welcome. Honourable senators may recall that recommendation 6.1 of the committee stated that the committee was not convinced that there was not a role for the tribunal to play in dealing with medical complaints. The good news is that the government now favours including complaints involving the interpretation of medical evidence within the tribunal's jurisdiction. I need not remind honourable senators that this chamber itself played an important part in contributing to this widely acclaimed decision. The Senate select committee has just concluded taking evidence of the first 12 months operation of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. That report will be given later this session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that in the submission to this recent tribunal review the ISC itself stated that a key factor in the government's decision to revise previous policy was the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal's caseload statistics over the first three months of its operation. The caseloads showed that less than 20 per cent of the written inquiries to the tribunal arose from disability claims and only a small proportion of those related to questions of medical evidence. A regulation gazetted on 1 November 1994 deferred the handling of disability complaints involving the assessment of medical evidence by the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal until 1 May 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A difficulty was acknowledged, by all, I believe, where the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was seeking a determination which affected contractual relationships between trustees and their external parties. This issue was also significant given the environment created by the judicial power in the High Court case Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the need for legislative amendments to bind insurers, and given other necessary amending issues, the exclusion of medical evidence from the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal jurisdiction was extended until 1 November 1995. I believe the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will have, after this date, all the necessary apparatus and structures to provide for a low cost, fast and efficient resolution of medical issues as an alternative dispute resolution forum to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This now brings me to the government's response to report No. 14, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superannuation regulations No. II: superannuation industry (supervision) regulations</EMPHASIS>. One of the key features of this report concerns the debate on member choice. Member choice is an increasingly important issue for superannuation members. I believe that in the future most superannuation funds will be offering member choice, not necessarily unlimited choice but some choice. However, I remind the Senate that that choice can be within only a range of investment options determined by trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be part of an evolution where members now largely have what I call investment risk, and they certainly have this in accumulation of funds. These members are demanding a greater and greater say in the operation of their superannuation investment. I need to remind the Senate that members do have different needs through life. I believe that these should be addressed by trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind honourable senators that trustees cannot give unfettered choice to members, because it would be an abrogation of their duties as trustees and would also be contrary to the legislation of SIS. Legislators must determine where the boundaries of reasonable choice actually lie. You might recall that the committee recommended in its 14th report that beneficiary investment choice be mandated for standard employer funds with 50 or more members and members generating investment components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mandating beneficiary investment choice for such funds would seek to remove a glaring inequity in the superannuation system. As it now stands, members of personal superannuation funds are mostly provided with the opportunity to choose the most appropriate investment strategy for their needs and, importantly, are considered capable of doing so. On the other hand, members of larger standard employer funds have no such choice, and, according to some commentators, are not capable of having a choice and should therefore be protected. The committee has recommended that a `one size fits all' approach to investment is not appropriate and will become untenable in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that a lot of women have made significant contributions to superannuation. Mavis Robertson, Linda Nicholls and Elizabeth Bryan are a few of them. Elizabeth Bryan was State Super Corporation General Manager, Investments, and won the Telstra New South Wales Businesswoman of the Year award. She basically says that a member's right of choice is more important than how many may exercise that choice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last two evenings, I have been talking about the need for the establishment of the marine park at the head of the Great Australian Bight and pointing out to the Senate that an extensive study has been carried out, at the behest of both the Commonwealth and the state, and that, despite the fact that that has been carried out&mdash;partly at the behest of the Commonwealth&mdash;the result of that study has been kept secret by the minister in the South Australian parliament and has not been released either to the Commonwealth or to members of the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out last evening that the minister responsible for declaring marine parks in South Australia is also the minister responsible for fisheries and the Minister for Mines and Energy and, as such, clearly has a conflict of interest when talking about the need for protecting marine areas for the purposes of protecting the breeding areas, principally, of the southern right whale. The minister responsible for fisheries and the Minister for Mines and Energy in South Australia has a conflict of interest with respect to his colleague the minister responsible for conservation. This may result in his reticence to support the marine park, despite the support which comes from the minister responsible for the environment in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disturbingly, the removal of SARDI from the draft management planning process is clear evidence of the increasing influence of the fishing industry in the management of South Australia's aquatic resources, at the expense of the independent long-term government research and management advice. This is evidenced by the establishment of integrated management committees, which now have statutory power to regulate and manage all of the state's aquatic resources, including habitat management, and to define research priorities&mdash;in effect, the privatisation of community owned resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these integrated management committees are overwhelmingly dominated by commercial fishing interests. Only one&mdash;the one involving aquaculture&mdash;has an environmental representative. SARDI's presence on these committees is not a statutory requirement. Any researcher, either industry or government, can be nominated. The South Australian Fishing Industry Council has recommended that any present SARDI representatives who sit on one of these integrated management committees have no voting rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, we have the South Australian government inhibiting what is&mdash;as we understand it, because we have not seen it&mdash;a very good, very well written and properly researched report which has gone through the process of input from a wide variety of public interest groups from being seen either by the public or by the Commonwealth. At the same time, the South Australian government is seeking to further inhibit the efforts of those legitimate researchers who work within the South Australian government at the moment to continue with their work on behalf of conservation, with a direction that their work be oriented towards exploitative activities. Many SARDI researchers feel that South Australia will follow the example of Victoria with a complete outsourcing of scientific research related to sustainable fisheries, with all research and research priorities being completely regulated by industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of the marine resource at Head of Bight in terms of tourism, as I have indicated already, far and away exceeds the importance of that area as a fishing resource. Whale watching is a rapid growth industry. In Western Australia, operators have reported a growth rate of 50 per cent over the last five years. In Queensland, two operators claimed a growth rate of 100 per cent in only two years. In Queensland, boat-based whale watching&mdash;this is mainly humpbacks in Harvey Bay&mdash;generated a direct income of $3 million in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Ningaloo Marine Park in WA whale shark visitors have increased 400 per cent from 500 visitors in 1992 to 2,000 visitors in 1994. Whale shark fees alone generated $500,000 in 1994. If the additional costs for fishing charters, safari tours, diving and accommodation are included, a total of more than $2 million was generated from the eco-tourism activities in the region during the six-week whale shark season. South Australia has already generated $310,000 direct income from cetacean watching enterprises. This is based on only 10 operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total catch of southern rock lobster within the total area of the proposed marine park boundaries was 44 tonnes in 1993-94 at current prices of $35 per kilogram. This represents a direct income of only $1.5 million. Within the proposed sanctuary zone&mdash;six per cent of the total marine park area&mdash;this translates into only $90,000 in income from rock lobster. It is important to note that the vast majority of the lobster taken in the proposed marine park is caught in the area east of Head of Bight. This area would be seasonally open to lobster fishing&mdash;that is, December to April&mdash;under the proposed conservation zone proposals. So here we have a direct comparison of the economic benefit of protecting this area as a major marine park&mdash;the economic benefit in terms of eco-tourism&mdash;compared with its established direct benefit as a fishing area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prospectivity for mineral and petroleum development is widely acknowledged to be poor in the marine park area. This has been confirmed by BHP, which has formally and publicly supported the marine park proposal. The Yalata land management program at the Head of Bight reported 10,000 whale watchers in 1994, with an estimated expenditure of $560,000 between Nullarbor Roadhouse and Ceduna. This is an area which at the moment is largely devoid of established tourist facilities. People have to literally go out there and camp to carry out this activity. The return in terms of eco-tourism could be very significantly increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on rates of increase in eco-tourism experienced elsewhere in Australia, with an expected rapid increase in whale watchers over the next five years, the Great Australian Bight Marine Park has the potential to generate in the order of $10 million to $20 million in direct income to the communities of the western Eyre Peninsula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Dominica, 600 people spent $230,000 to watch sperm whales in 1993. Whale Watch Kaikoura, in New Zealand, won the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow award in the green tourism category in February 1995. The award recognises the high standards, contributions to the local economy and sensitivity to the environment. Whale watching has become a national icon that reinforces New Zealand tourism's clean-green image, which is very lucrative in the nature-based and eco-tourism market. They expect 44,000 whale watchers this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated direct value of shore and boat-based dolphin and whale watching, that is, humpback and southern right whale, in Australia in 1993 was approximately $5.2 million, employing 200 people. The industry is considered to be continuing to grow rapidly. These figures are from an Australian Nature Conservation Agency report by Gordon Anderson to the International Whaling Commission in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the 17,500 hectare Head of Bight Sanctuary represents approximately 31 per cent of the total sanctuary area recommended and only 10 per cent of the total state waters recommended for protection under the SARDI-prepared draft management plan. The original project funded by the Commonwealth was for a large, multiple-use marine park, not a small, unzoned area proposed by the South Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Head of Bight Sanctuary cannot be considered a marine park but rather an aquatic reserve, that is, the small South Australian one. Marine parks are defined nationally and internationally as large areas, zoned for multiple-use activities. They are specifically established to manage a range of non-exploitative and exploitative activities. Importantly, they incorporate the concept of buffer zones. I strongly recommend that senators look at this proposal, and urge the federal government to become more intensively involved to ensure that this area at Head of Bight is properly protected. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1993, there was another qualified audit report. In February 1995, there was another qualified audit report in which it was found that the various accounts of the council and the trust fund were overdrawn by $128,981. How you can overdraw a trust account is completely beyond me. It is a disastrous state of affairs. That qualified audit report also indicated that there was a significant increase in arrears of debts outstanding to the council, 80 per cent of which were estimated to be uncollectable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt lawyers for this council will respond to my statements here in parliament today by saying that significant improvements have been made and that the council was recently congratulated by the minister for improving. That does not really mean terribly much, given that this council has an appalling track record of management, both financial and proprietorial. I believe that to say that the council had been congratulated on improving when it still cannot adequately manage its affairs is not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do I say this council cannot adequately manage its affairs? The explanation for that is really quite simple. I visited the community recently. Amongst some of the concerns that were raised with me, a number of elders, including one elder by the name of Gordon Charlie, asked me to inquire of the council's solicitors as to whether they could be provided with a copy of a compensation agreement entered into between  Cape Flattery Silica Mine and the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the council's claim for compensation was based on the claims of traditional owners, one of whom was Mr Gordon Charlie. I received a letter from Messrs Bottoms English, lawyers for the council, on 4 August stating that they were going to obtain instructions from the Hopevale Aboriginal Council concerning the matter. I wrote to them again on 23 August saying, `Three weeks have elapsed since I wrote to you and I have not received another response.' In the eight days that have elapsed since then I still have not received a response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would be disturbing even if you did not know that all of the councillors who are on the Hopevale Aboriginal Council are paid as full-time employees of the council. In four weeks the council has been unable to give instructions to its lawyers as to whether or not it can release a copy of the Cape Flattery compensation agreement to a senator who is inquiring on behalf of a constituent who could not get a copy of it from the council because it claimed that the copy that it had was burnt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite ridiculous. What angers me even more is that it is alleged&mdash;and I believe it is quite possibly the case&mdash;that the council is failing to properly deal with CDEP moneys that are paid to it. Honourable senators may well know that a council is generally provided with $177 or thereabouts per week in respect of each CDEP participant, and that those participants must receive or have the opportunity of earning an amount at least equal to the newstart allowance or jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I visited the Hopevale community at the beginning of the month there were many people who said to me that they or their children or their husbands were receiving substantially less than the jobsearch allowance, that there were deductions made from their pay without authorisation, that the council had failed to adequately account to them and that they only got the money they believed they were entitled to if they kicked up a fuss. Having kicked up a fuss, they would be paid the appropriate amount for a certain period of time and then further deductions would be made from their wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason that the bad administration in this council has persisted is that the Criminal Justice Commission has failed to name this council. I do not understand what is achieved by failing to name this council. We do not advance the situation in which the Aboriginal people of Hopevale find themselves if official inquiries into that council continue to cover up the most appalling state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report, the Criminal Justice Commission concluded that it was impossible to bring charges against some of the people for the simple reason that the records were so lamentably inadequate as to be non-existent in some cases and to be totally unreliable in other cases. All the while that this goes on, the honest and decent Aboriginal people of Hopevale, which I believe is the vast majority, are on the receiving end of this sort of maladministration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made these statements here tonight because I hope the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, who on other occasions has dealt with my concerns in a fairly satisfactory way, will initiate an immediate inquiry into the use of CDEP funds at the council. It is also time the council recognised that it has a responsibility to its constituents, to its ratepayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other things that are wrong at Hopevale. This is just a small selection of the matters. I believe it is about time the people of Hopevale received better administration than they are getting. If we have to go through this process for as many months as it takes, I will continue to do this because I believe that decent people deserve decent government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise tonight deals with the Beijing conference for women, which is currently being held. I cannot help but note the irony of a country such as Taiwan not being given status in the United Nations&mdash;although I understand, as a result of a circular by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, that the United Nations is now giving consideration to its membership. But I find it somewhat ironic that the conference for empowering women is being held in Beijing, in the People's Republic of China, under UN auspices, when a country like Taiwan is not being given recognition in the United Nations. Indeed, I know that if there were a choice to live in either Taiwan or the People's Republic of China, I am sure every single Australian would opt for living in Taiwan because it has a greater regard for human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it somewhat ironic that the conference is being held in Beijing and that we, as a nation, are going there relatively quietly. I just ponder what would be the situation if this conference were to be held in France, in relation to the nuclear testing that that country is about to conduct. Methinks the government may well be arguing for a boycott. Indeed, one thing that has not been presented at all to the Australian community in the same way as the French nuclear testing has been the question of Chinese nuclear testing, which has been going on, and on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will argue that we should not boycott China and that really our involvement there will assist reform that country. It is interesting to note that the people who argue that are the same people who argued against involvement with South Africa. Those same people argued for boycotts against South Africa because that would be the only way to break down the regime which did not allow human rights to the vast majority of the population in that country and had denied them the vote. They said that the only way to deal with it would be to have a boycott of that country. So it is interesting to note the different approaches that we, as a country, are taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real purpose for my comments tonight is to deal with the question of the Beijing conference and what we are doing there. It is interesting to note that Dr Lawrence said that our paper, our presentation, at this conference was largely determined as a result of trying to get responses through what was called the purple postcard campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 May 1995, she said that the 2,250 replies raised more than 5,000 points of concern, whereas, as a result of answers during Senate estimates, we were told in the executive summary on this purple postcards project that the responses covered around 4,500 issues. So Dr Lawrence and her office clearly took a degree of liberty in indicating the response rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These purple postcards asking for women's input were largely put around universities, workplaces, unions, international women's day events, live music venues and women's organisations. Circulating them widely within that area, one would assume that a particular response may have been achieved, as opposed to what would be found from sending it out to a lot of women who are at home looking after children or who are in employment in small business areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is that Beijing was chosen as the venue for this discussion on empowering women by the United Nations and the world community. Beijing would have to be seen as the world capital of repressing women's rights through its brutal population control, which it has made into an art form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us never forget that, during the Nuremberg trials after the Second World War, a crime against humanity was defined as including the forcing of a pregnant woman to submit to the killing of her unborn child. That was a crime against humanity according to the Nuremberg trials. These well-known crimes against humanity are practised every day in the People's Republic of China. But, for some reason, because it is the People's Republic of China, the world community wants to cast a blind eye. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China is a totalitarian, authoritarian, one-party state which ignores universally held civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. In the world human rights guide third survey of 1992, China scored the fifth lowest ranking out of 75 countries. The 1994-95 Freedom House annual survey of freedom included China in the worst violator countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A country like that does not deserve the privilege of hosting a conference such as the one that is taking place at the moment. Indeed, negotiations over the text of the conference resolutions have been very much put in China's favour. It proved impossible to secure an unequivocal condemnation of abuses such as forced abortion and sterilisation. I remind the Senate that the Nuremberg trials said that those sort of activities are a crime against humanity. So if you cannot even get that as the starting point when you are talking about women's rights, and if you cannot agree, because the host country will not agree, that those sorts of activities are not a crime against humanity, what on earth is the world community doing in going to that country and giving it a degree of kudos within the world community that somehow it really does believe in women's rights and human rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is running out. Paragraph 115 in the section on violence against women states that other acts of violence against women include violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict, particularly murder, systematic rape and sexual slavery. Forced pregnancy is noted in brackets. The rest, which is in brackets, is what could not be agreed upon because of the concerns of the People's Republic of China. Acts of violence against women also include terrorism, forced sterilisation and forced abortion, the coercive, forced use of contraceptives, female foeticide, prenatal sex selection and female infanticide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the world community cannot agree that these are abuses against the rights of women, I do not know what an abuse of women's rights could actually be. Why we are allowing this conference to be hosted in Beijing, when the host country refuses to acknowledge such basic and fundamental human rights, really does concern me. I simply ask: why is there any disagreement about the inclusion of such wording in the document at this conference? I ask the federal government to reconsider its position in relation to the Beijing conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to discuss a major issue for Australian women. I had hoped I would have an opportunity earlier today, having asked a question of Senator Crowley, to take note of that answer&mdash;well, I should not elevate the status of her response to the status of an answer&mdash;but I did not. It was her response in answer to a question which I had asked her about how much an average women who works for 25 years&mdash;not the 39 years of the average man&mdash;at 85 per cent of male earnings would have in superannuation when she retires.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dishonesty that is being perpetrated amongst Australians, and which will be accentuated next week, is nothing short of the sort of lie or story that was told to Australian people when former Prime Minister Hawke said, `No child will live in poverty by the year 2000.' If anybody who is over 18 years of age out there thinks that the superannuation guarantee fund the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is putting forward will support them in their retirement, they are wrong&mdash;and, in particular, Australian women will not be supported in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has had 13 years to get a retirement incomes policy in place. It has fiddled at the edges of superannuation to the point where people have no faith in it because they feel it will change all the time. The government is to spend $12.5 million&mdash;I repeat: $12.5 million&mdash;on an advertising campaign, funded by the taxpayer, to push the benefits of superannuation. Next week is national superannuation awareness week&mdash;well, I reckon it is `superannuation con week'. It is scheduled to coincide with the distribution to every household of a booklet explaining how superannuation works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago in June we had a booklet circulated to all households about the wonders of the social security system; that cost two-and-a-bit million dollars. Now we have $12 1/2 million being spent on telling them about money growing on trees. The Prime Minister's extravagant $12 1/2 million propaganda campaign within six months of an election is a blatant political stunt designed to overcome public scepticism about the government's enforced savings plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, says that he has research that shows that 76 per cent of women think that super is good for them, personally. Of course they do. They also think savings, democracy and motherhood are good things. That is not the point. The point is: are women treated equitably and fairly under Labor's superannuation policies? And the answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the implementation of a national savings policy and a retirement incomes policy which provide incentive and reward to all Australians. What we do not support is the sort of con trick which Mr Keating is perpetrating on the women of Australia. He has gloated that an average wage earner joining the work force now would retire with nearly half a million dollars in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, you have to be 25 at the time it is fully in force, so you have to be 18 now and work continually throughout 40 years to even hope to hit the $500,000&mdash;and that is only if everything goes to plan, such as interest rates going up at the same rate. But if you are a woman and have worked for 25 years&mdash;not the 39 years of a man&mdash;at 85 per cent of male earnings, you will not have that in your superannuation. This is an absolute fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the government had an opportunity when the coalition put forward a retirement savings policy for women. The government before the 1993 election sort of half copied that and let women continue to put into their superannuation for two years after they left employment. But that is not good enough. There really has not been an adequate attempt on the part of the government to address the issue of women's superannuation. In fact, Eva Cox, convenor of the Economic Women's Think Tank, has said that it is unfair and inequitable; she has cast doubts on the government's plan. </PARA>
