<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been much agony over Constitutional change to include Federal powers in relation to the environment. It has been claimed that the Commonwealth already has almost all the power it needs to protect the environment. Alternatively, it has been said that it needs a specific head of environmental authority. The first group claims that what is lacking is the political will to use the powers that are there, the second that these powers are oblique to the central object of environmental protection and that specific powers would help clarify the proper role of the Federal Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many feel that both Labor and Coalition Federal Governments have failed on occasion to use the powers that are available under the Constitution. Others feel that Federal Governments have often exceeded the exercise of its powers with respect to environmental protection. One is also aware of the difficulty in achieving Constitutional change in any area and that one that sought to extend Commonwealth powers is almost doomed to failure. Given this difficulty and the sensitivity of Federal and State Governments to `state rights' it seems highly unlikely that any attempt to write specific environmental powers into the constitution would be successful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, when the Constitution was written no thought was given to environment, the word does not appear in the Constitution and now, in 1995, it is time to bring the very basis of our law making up to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, while a member of a Parliamentary delegation to four southern African countries I became aware of the Namibian Constitution. Namibia has been independent for only four years so its Constitution is a new document. It is structured very differently from the Australian document with a whole section devoted to `Principles of State Policy'. This section sets out the broad principles that will guide the Parliament in the application of the specific powers which the Constitution provides. The principles deal with 12 areas including sexual equality, equity and access to education as well as the maintenance of ecosystems, ecological sustainability and intergenerational equity. While the inclusion of a section outlining the broad principles that should guide the exercise of specific powers seems an approach worthy of serious consideration this bill seeks the more modest aim of writing in only one principle that needs to be taken into account. If this change is successful perhaps other principles could be added later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 51 of the Australian Constitution sets out the powers to be exercised by the Federal Parliament. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">s 51: The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then follows 39 subsections each of which confer a specific power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (i.) Trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(xx.) Foreign corporations, and trading and financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth: etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the quoted sections have been used to obtain environmental protection. Section 51 (i.) has been used to prohibit the export of minerals unless the written approval of the federal Minister is obtained. The High Court approved the exercise of this discretion by the federal Minister to prohibit the export of minerals from Fraser Island for environmental reasons. It decided that the Minister could have regard to environmental aspects of mining in refusing approval of export permits. This was an initiative of the Fraser Coalition Government and it lead eventually to the protection of Fraser Island as a World Heritage Area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hydroelectric Commission in Tasmania was deemed to be a trading corporation when the High Court considered the appeal against the Federal Government's designation of SW Tasmania as a World Heritage Area. This was an initiative of a federal Labor Government. The decision of the High Court in the Tasmanian Dam Case extended the operation of this power under S 51 (xx.) so that the Commonwealth may control, having regard to environmental considerations, all manufacturing, production or extractive processes conducted by corporations, as defined in S 51 (xx), for the purposes of trade. This power does not extend to the operations of State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">S 51 (xxix.) provides the external affairs powers under which the High Court has ruled that the Commonwealth may pass a range of valid laws, including laws to protect the environment, so long as they are in faithful pursuit of an obligation imposed by an international agreement and they are not in breach of other constitutional limitations such as S 92 imposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Powers with respect to race (S 51 (xxvi.) may be used to legislate the protection or conservation of a site of Aboriginal significance and this power was relied upon in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 passed by a federal Labor Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">But these powers may or may not be exercised</EMPHASIS>  and the Constitution contains no guidance as to how and to what ends these powers are to be directed. A review of the occasions when the powers have been exercised in the defence of the environment indicates an arbitrariness difficult to justify on any objective criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My bill does not add any new powers to the Constitution. It does not grant any new powers to the Commonwealth and it does not therefore interfere with the balance between the Commonwealth and the States.  It adds after the last subsection of Section 51 a paragraph which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">When making a law under this section each House of the Parliament must take into account the probable effects of that law on:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) the maintenance of ecosystems and of essential ecological processes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) the biological diversity of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) the utilisation of the living natural resources on a sustainable basis for the benefit of all Australians, both present and in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not seek to give the Federal Parliament any new power and can not therefore be accused of usurping the role of the states. And I believe this will provide a less controversial way of getting these important principles into the debate which leads to the passing of any new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Final Report of the Constitutional Commission 1988 recommended that the Constitution be not altered to give the Federal Parliament power to make laws with respect to the environment. It noted that the Federal Parliament had no express power to make laws with respect to `the environment' or `the protection of the environment'. The Advisory Committee to the Commission, the Distribution of Powers Committee, was disposed to giving the Commonwealth specific powers with respect to the environment but fell short of recommending such a power on the grounds that it would be difficult to restrict the exercise of such a power to matters of national concern. It noted that the concept of national concern is itself too vague and subjective to form the basis of an appropriate constitutional criterion which could be used to test the legal validity of legislation enacted in the exercise of this power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment sought in this bill achieves the desire of the Distribution of Powers Advisory Committee in that it provides a flavour to the exercise of the powers already in the Constitution but avoids the pitfalls of defining any new powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Environmental Law Commission in its submission to the Powers Committee argued for the inclusion of environmental powers in the Constitution, pointing out that such a power `is capable of being adapted to the changing political circumstances of the nation' and `does not and should not produce fears of concerns that the localised interests of State governments will be put at risk' by its exercise. It would `vest the Commonwealth with the powers to influence and guide the performance of such functions within the States from a national perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The South Australian Government favoured a much more limited role for the Commonwealth agreeing that some environmental power with respect to protection of major water ways with interstate distribution, land degradation, items of heritage value and areas of national significance might be areas for Commonwealth involvement. Other submissions disagreed with even this limited extension of Commonwealth power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a serious defect in the exercise of power with respect to many environmental matters that there is not a clearly defined role for each of the levels of government. This becomes obvious when standards for water quality, air or chemical exposure are being set. Complex and very time consuming intergovernmental committees slowly thrash their way through disagreements and minimum standards. In several instances this has been resolved with the Commonwealth playing a leadership role and the States passing complementary legislation. The role envisaged for the Commonwealth by the Environmental Law Commission above has been fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that this amendment to the Constitution will turn the minds of federal parliamentarians toward such a role for the Commonwealth while avoiding the realisation of the fears of those who seek greater control over environmental management at the local level. If the federal parliament continues to exercise the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">same</EMPHASIS> powers it has always possessed but takes into account, in the exercise of those powers, the care and protection of the natural environment as defined in this amendment one can be hopeful that a better, but still cooperative system of management will develop.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment does not use the word environment because the word has been used in so many unrelated contexts. Instead the amendment specifies those things the legislators should consider: maintenance of ecosystems, ecological processes, biological diversity, sustainability and the present generations responsibility to those generations as yet unborn. All these principles have been widely accepted by Government, Opposition, other parties and a majority of the Australian population. Every one of them has found expression in agreements and laws which have become part of everyday life in the last few decades. The ESD Committees took most of these concerns as a given, groups and committees working on greenhouse response and biodiversity have accepted these principles as their basis. Each has been written into various laws and into numerous government and party policy documents. There is nothing exceptional about these principles. Most present parliamentarians have expressed support for these principles during recent speeches. In this respect the amendment codifies what the majority support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment does not increase in any way the power of the Commonwealth, it provides a reminder that in passing legislation, the Commonwealth. as custodian of the nations natural heritage, has a responsibility to exercise its existing powers in a way which takes account of that heritage for both the present generation and for all future Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans's actions just now show what a farce this whole censure motion is, always was, and always will be. Senator Evans comes in here after having had the great idea on Monday that he would cut into Senator Baume, that he would have a go at besmirching Senator Baume with a censure motion which was poorly drafted, which was wholly inaccurate, which utterly disregarded any facts, which utterly disregarded any basic principles of natural justice and which utterly disregarded any principles of law. He got the chance to bring his censure motion on last night. Senator Evans was wholly and utterly humiliated in this place by Senator Hill last night in his address. There is not a skerrick of evidence, there is not one legal proposition, there is not one principle of natural justice that supports the case that Senator Evans brought before this chamber in this censure motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that was demonstrated to Senator Evans throughout the debate last night, when it was to be demonstrated to Senator Evans and the Australian people again today, on a broadcast day, what was the response from Senator Evans? Was it to say, `We will seek to withdraw it'? No. Was it to say, `We have embarked on this course of action. We will let it run its course'? No. It was to stand up here at a quarter to 10 and say, `Sorry, everybody. I would like to put this off a bit while I try to plea bargain the fact that I could not draw the censure motion properly in the first place.' That was his response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a man who fancies himself as Chief Justice of the High Court, ably assisted by Robespierre over there and the law clerk. That was the case we had last night. We had the Chief Justice, Robespierre and the law clerk. Together, all three of them, aided by one of the chief witnesses for the prosecution, could not come up with a case. Why could they not come up with a case? Because there is no case for Senator Baume to answer under this censure motion. It is highly extraordinary that there should be a censure motion of a back bench senator in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go to the motives of that a little later in the speech, but I feel it is important right here and now to show what a legal and judicial farce this has become. Let us look at some of the charges against Senator Baume in this censure motion. Some of these charges are absolutely absurd. This is great. Paragraph (b) of the motion says that the Senate should censure Senator Baume for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)his commission of an act, the disclosure of Dr Macdonald's tax file number, which would have been a crime if done outside the parliament. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a great charge to have&mdash;except for one little problem: Senator Baume never knew he was disclosing, and never intended to disclose, that tax file number. Yet here we have a trumped up charge from the pretender to be Chief Justice and from Robespierre that says, `We are going to accuse a person of doing something he did not know he was doing. We are going to accuse a person of doing something even though he did not have the slightest intention to do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is going to be the standard of accountability in this parliament, so be it. We will start to apply that standard of accountability to the people on the other side of the chamber, because every time a government minister has been accused of an indiscretion in this place, every time a government minister has been accused of doing something wrong, the defence has been from the other side, `Sorry, I did not know I had done it. My staffer did it'&mdash;the Miles Kupa defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume is to be accused, tried and convicted of something he did not know he was doing. But I submit to the Senate that the first person for the high jump should have been not Senator Baume, but Senator Evans, for every time he has come in here and said, `I am sorry, my staffer did it. I did not do it. I did not know about it.' It is Senator Evans who should be on trial in this place. It is Senator Collins who should be on trial in this place. We only have to remember the pay TV fiasco when Senator Collins said, `It was not me. It was my staffer.' We only have to remember the TAAATS fiasco over which Senator Collins presided. Again, it was not Senator Collins's fault, because he did not know it was happening; it was somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not saying, `We are going to abide by those standards, we are going to accept responsibility for things we do not know about.' Instead, this government is lovely; it is clever. It says, `We are only going to apply that standard to members of the opposition.' What a farce this government is. These are people who parade their credentials to believe in human rights, who parade their credentials to believe in natural justice. Where is the natural justice for Senator Baume? There is no natural justice. Where are the human rights for Senator Baume? There are no human rights, because human rights and natural justice rely upon a consistent legal standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this government applies a different legal standard to the charges it lays against Senator Baume as compared to the charges it wishes to acknowledge of its own wrongs, then natural justice and human rights in this chamber are a farce; and they have been turned into a farce by Robespierre, by the pretender to be Chief Justice and by the law clerk. What a ridiculous charge to trump up against Senator Baume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go into the facts of this matter. The facts of this matter are very clear. Senator Baume made a speech on Thursday night to which this government took exception. It did not like what Senator Baume had to say. It then alleged that the purpose of the speech, in part, was to disclose the tax file number of Dr Peter Macdonald. Let us examine whether the intention of Senator Baume's contribution on Thursday night was to disclose the tax file number of Dr Peter Macdonald. I submit to the Senate that it clearly was not to disclose the tax file number of Dr Peter Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not his intention because, first of all, Senator Baume did not realise the document contained the tax file number.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley did not recognise that there was a tax file number there either. So, if Senator Baume is to be convicted of the charge of doing something he did not know he was doing, let us change the terms of this censure motion and add Senator Crowley to the list as well. Let us be fair about it; let us cut into Senator Crowley as well. If we are going to cut into Senator Baume for committing an offence he did not know he was committing and there was a tax file number on a document that was tabled, Senator Crowley ought to be included in this censure motion because she was given an opportunity to pick it up and did not do so. </PARA>

Let us forget about the fact that our duty minister, who had a copy of the document before it was tabled, did not know either.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kangaroo court over there would like to draft the law so that it applies one standard to Senator Baume and members of the opposition and applies another standard to its own people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another matter to be considered here. This motion accuses Senator Baume of having an unlawful intent. It accuses Senator Baume of having the intent to disclose a tax file number. Not only did Senator Baume not know there was a tax file number but, furthermore, when Senator Baume realised there was a tax file number contained on the document he took every possible step to ensure that that tax file number was not put on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was Senator Baume's first response when he became aware that there was a tax file number on the document? He contacted the Clerk of the Senate and asked that the tax file number be excised from the document. The Clerk of the Senate said that he would need a request in writing. Senator Baume in a committee hearing wrote out a request on the first bit of paper possible, sent it to the Clerk of the Senate and said, `Please excise this tax file number because I do not want to release this tax file number which is contained on the document.' Senator Baume is being accused of having criminal intent by that side of the chamber when all of the facts are that, rather than having criminal intent, Senator Baume did everything he possibly could to ensure nobody got that tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else did Senator Baume do? Senator Baume saw the Table Office and said, `Who has got a copy of this document because I want to contact them and make sure they do not disclose the tax file number.' He was told that the document was received by three journalists, all of whom he contacted and all of whom undertook to him that they would not disclose the tax file number, and it was received by two Labor senators. It was not until last night that we knew who the two Labor senators were.

We need, firstly, to acknowledge that we have a very serious matter before us and, secondly, to get on with other matters. We need to resolve this matter and not get into party political point scoring. Both sides of this chamber are capable of doing things that, in the view of the other parties, are reprehensible.

There was an explanation offered which revealed that Dr Macdonald's taxation matters involved an inadvertent error too. I think there is a balance there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I like Senator Baume. I like his tenacity. This parliament needs people who are not easily discouraged from their perceived mission. I remind the Senate that I sat here in this seat for some years next to former Senator Paul McLean while he pleaded with the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition to allow documents to be tabled&mdash;documents which he had decided were in fact dynamite in terms of the public interest. These particular documents challenged the moral integrity of one of Australia's largest commercial institutions and were very dangerous. They clearly revealed exploitation of Australian citizens, the institution's own customers, and Australia's farmers and business people. Some of those people have been ruined by the actions of the institution. The institution was the Westpac bank and the documents were the Westpac letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul McLean had carefully read, cross-referenced, detailed and filed all of those documents and he knew that they were definitely in the greater public interest. We&mdash;that is, former Senator Paul McLean and I&mdash;were both amazed at the unwillingness of both parties to step outside the politicking and to really consider the greater public interest. Eventually the Democrats worked as a team across Australia and were able to table those documents in the South Australian parliament, and subsequently Paul McLean's efforts have been vindicated. I have learned from that example how difficult it can sometimes be to cajole this chamber into achieving something or acting in the greater public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I recount that for the benefit of the Senate because it is sometimes necessary to be persistent, and persistent Senator Baume certainly is. But I have to ask in this instance whether the matter of concern was in fact in the greater public interest. I quote from Senator Baume's contribution last night. He told us: `I was so interested in the amount of tax avoidance I did not focus on the fact that there was a number on the document which was a tax file number.' I ask: what is it that was being tabled? It was a tax document. What should be on every tax document in existence in Australia? Surely it is not a tax document unless it has a tax file number on it. The very first thing you would look for would be a tax file number. All the communications I have had with the Australian Taxation Office have required the inclusion of my tax file number, and I would assume that to be the case here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, whether that is true in all instances is not the point. I would have thought it would be logical to expect there to be a great likelihood of there being a tax file number on the document. I would be looking on any document that I described as a tax document for a tax file number. Whether Senator Baume took the trouble to scour that document or not, I suggest that there is another principle at stake as well. That is that for those people who seek to table a document in this place, there is a responsibility attached to the tabler, and that responsibility should be to ensure that the document is both accurate and legitimate and that it does not defame or make life difficult in any way that is not intended by the tabling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a situation where Senator Baume was criticising a person who had prepared a document, or who had paid a third party to prepare a document, and had discovered that there was something wrong with that document. He had then taken retrospective action to correct it. Surely that is similar, even parallel, to the action taken by Senator Baume himself. Yet Senator Baume seeks to condemn Dr Macdonald for having done something, discovering that he had not done quite the right thing and then retrospectively correcting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Macdonald was in a situation where no charges were pending. The Taxation Office was satisfied. The New South Wales Premier was satisfied. No further action was being contemplated by anybody. Yet Senator Baume says that he believes Dr Macdonald had a duty to reveal this to his electorate. Why was this forum chosen&mdash;this particular forum? If Senator Baume believed that Dr Macdonald had a duty to reveal this to his electorate, why not have it revealed in the New South Wales parliament or in a forum within which Dr Macdonald would have had an opportunity to respond? I repeat: why this forum? If revelation were to be especially undertaken in this place, a great responsibility attached to the accuracy of that revelation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have a situation here where, as I said earlier, a little bit of the sting can be taken out. I was very tempted by the original proposition put by Senator Gareth Evans. In listening to the debate from Senator Hill, I find there is cause for some correction to be considered. I was disappointed with the manner in which Senator Hill made his criticisms. I was reminded more of a school boarding house, with the giggling and cackling which accompanied the revelation of what was wrong. However, when one looked past the school-boyish attitude, the substance did have some appeal. I was seeking to challenge that substance and to look at a path which was not quite so vindictive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have preferred to have had the last say. However, the amendment that has been moved by the Greens is in a form that we still regard as unsatisfactory. It certainly removes the stigma of a censure&mdash;and I am pleased to see that some commonsense has prevailed in that regard. But, when it deals in terms of deploring Senator Baume's negligence in tabling the document in which he inadvertently revealed Dr Macdonald's tax file number, I think it should be properly understood&mdash;and this is what Senator Bell in his gratuitous comments of a few minutes ago failed to appreciate&mdash;that the document did not refer to a tax file number at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document referred simply to `file number'. But you came in here wanting to condemn him with a censure not only for inadvertently tabling that but also for inadvertently failing to appreciate that it was a tax file number when it did not say it was a tax file number. All that demonstrates is that this whole motion has been brought with malice. This is where the Democrats have got it again. They are so precious. The government does not come in here with any good faith in this matter. It is just a political hatchet job. We all know that. It is all in the environment that exists in Australian politics at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the numbers are going to be here today, unfortunately, to resolve that Senator Baume be condemned for his negligence in tabling a document in which he inadvertently revealed a tax file number even though it did not specifically state that it was a tax file number. That is unfortunate, but I accept that it is a lot better than what the government was seeking, which was a censure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take it from Senator Bell's comments that he would have been inclined to support the censure. That tells me more about the Australian Democrats than anything else. Senator Chamarette said this morning that she was inclined to support the censure, although at least she had the goodwill to say that she acknowledged the apology Senator Baume had made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all make errors. No matter how much care we apply, we make mistakes. Generally, in the spirit of goodwill in this place if you make an inadvertent mistake and you then apologise, that is the end of the matter. Apparently that is not good enough for the others in this chamber, but it is at least better than a censure. I am glad that, although it has taken some time, at least that issue is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of Senator Chamarette's amendment is that she deplores his judgment. This is the input into these matters concerning Dr Macdonald's understatement of his taxable income on the public record, she says without him having adequate time to respond. That is again a judgment for individuals to make. It is a balancing act. Even the motion as drawn by Senator Evans demonstrates that he recognises that it is a balance between what an individual senator believes should be on the public record in order that the public might assess the suitability of a person for parliamentary office on the one hand, and on the other hand any invasion of personal privacy that results therefrom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time we intrude into matters relating to whether a person is fit and proper there has to be an element of invasion of privacy, but we accept that because we are in public life. There will always be a balancing act. But to come in here and try to turn that into a censurable offence was not well founded and Senator Evans knows that. It is just part of the politics of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that at least the numbers are such that a censure will not result in this place. That would have been deplorable. I regret that the numbers are still such that the Senate will apparently, despite our opposition, deplore that Senator Baume exercised his judgment so that the balance went in favour of public revelation, but so be it. Senator Baume certainly understands what it means; it simply means that the government and the minority parties have made a judgment that, on balance, personal privacy considerations should have overridden the public right to know. That is all it really amounts to. So be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased that commonsense has prevailed to the extent that the attempt to send Senator Baume to the Privileges Committee over this matter is being abandoned. That would have been a disgrace and an abuse of the function of the Privileges Committee. Again it has taken a fair while to get to this stage but I am pleased the amendment deletes that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we recognise that the amendment that is being moved is less offensive than the original motion, although we are still not happy with it. When it is carried and the substantive motion is put we will oppose the substantive motion and divide on it. But we put on record the fact that we are at least pleased that the potential of a censure has been abandoned and that the effort of the government to send Senator Baume to the Privileges Committee has also been abandoned. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Censure', in the parliamentary sense, is the most vigorous and, I suppose, the most serious of all reflections against a member of the parliament; and the explanations that have been given by Senator Baume do not warrant that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the action is to be deplored. Although it is acknowledged that the action was inadvertent, the action of tabling documents which contain a tax file number is to be deplored, despite the fact&mdash;and I accept what Senator Baume says&mdash;that it was difficult to identify whether it was a file number or a tax file number unless you were looking for the position. Nevertheless, it is a matter which is to be deplored, and I think Senator Baume has really acknowledged that in his letter to Dr Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened carefully to what Senator Chamarette said in respect of her amendment. She proposes to delete what has just been acknowledged by Senator Hill to be a rather bizarre situation; that is, after you have hanged a person you send it to the Privileges Committee and then, as I heard Senator Schacht say last night, he will have an opportunity of making his case before the Privileges Committee. My goodness, you cannot just hang a person and then send it to the Privileges Committee and say that there he has an opportunity for natural justice. That matter has been taken care of in Senator Chamarette's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Senator Chamarette's amendment does deplore the situation&mdash;I think the situation is something which we all deplore&mdash;and I believe that it is a reasonable amendment. I will be supporting that amendment, with a couple of minor amendments which I believe go to the factual situation. I foreshadow that I will be moving those amendments after Senator Chamarette's amendment has been, I hope, adopted and before the question is put. Paragraph (a)(iii) of the motion says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)that Senator Baume's only stated purpose in tabling these documents was to impugn the integrity of Dr Macdonald before the New South Wales State election in which Dr Macdonald was an independent candidate,</PARA>
<PARA>My foreshadowed motion would delete the word `only'. I listened to what Senator Baume said, and I do not think it is accurate to keep the word `only' there. The part of the motion which mentions `to impugn the integrity' should, in my view, be `to question the integrity'. The motion would therefore read `that Senator Baume's stated purpose in tabling these documents was to question the integrity of Dr Macdonald'. The next line of the motion says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)that Senator Baume, in seeking the leave of the duty Minister and the Senate to table the documents in question . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would like the words `was not aware of and thus' inserted after that. The motion would then read `in seeking the leave of the duty Minister and the Senate to table the documents in question was not aware of and thus did not draw attention to the tax file number identified therein'. I think that is a more accurate reflection. I think it would be a reasonably strong motion if it were adopted with amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now some weeks since I commenced my speech in this debate on the National Health Amendment Bill (No.2). It is somewhat concerning to think that the government has just delayed this bill. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia is very concerned about the delay that has been caused by the maladministration of this government. We have just seen another classical example of this. We spent all night last night and this morning debating a futile motion of censure. The government should get its priorities right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the National Health Amendment Bill (No.2) makes changes which will impact on the communities of rural and remote areas of Australia. I would have thought it was important to this government to have these changes in place. It has now left it to the deadline of Friday before the effect of this legislation will be felt by pharmacies right throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that these areas are already greatly disadvantaged by the government's health policy, or lack of it, I am keen to make sure that their access to pharmacies can be guaranteed. It is not an optimal outcome that people have to travel hundreds of kilometres to visit a pharmacist. The reality of this government is that it does not seem to mind that it makes country people&mdash;particularly in my state of Western Australia&mdash;travel very long distances to pharmacies. All of the changes that it made many years ago ensured that that was to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of community consultation on this bill contradicts the stated aims of the national rural health strategy, which sought increased community consultation and participation in the development and implementation of rural health strategies. As I also said earlier, people in rural areas already experience more pronounced health problems in areas such as mental illness, suicide, road trauma and substance abuse, including alcohol. These are described in the national rural health strategy, along with other health problems such as ear and eye infections, diabetes and respiratory disorders, which disproportionately affect the Aboriginal communities of Australia. The strategy also noted that, compared with their metropolitan counterparts, many rural residents experience significant problems of inequity with respect to access to and provision of health care services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that the Department of Human Services and Health is having a hard time trying to attract medical practitioners to country areas. This has been the case for some years now. What still concerns me&mdash;and I know it concerns Senator Herron, coming from a large state like Queensland&mdash;is that we are not attracting enough doctors into rural parts of Australia, particularly in the isolated and larger states such as Queensland and Western Australia. Although I must admit that it is an Australia wide problem, it is particularly pertinent to my state of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet for all the discussion papers and strategies, there appears to have been little noticeable effect on rural health, as evidenced by the recent paper from the ANU. The maldistribution of health services continues. I would hope that, as pharmacies are rationalised through amalgamation and closure, there is not a negative impact on rural and remote communities, despite the existence of safety net provisions to support the survival of such pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already the number of pharmacies in Australia has declined by 10 per cent, which is in line with the aim of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority. It is believed that the number of pharmacies is now at a more viable level. We are yet to see that and make sure that country people are not disadvantaged. As to whether viability is synonymous with adequate service provisions, I would think rural and remote communities and the health interest groups within those communities should be allowed to be the judge of that in line with the government's stated policy on consulting with rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly encourage the government to have more consultation with doctors, health professionals, pharmacists and those in the communities of country areas. Until this is taking place in an ongoing fashion, we can be assured of only one thing: that those in the country will continue to be disadvantaged, although they can no longer afford to be so. This has gone on far too long. I hope that this government makes a positive move to ensuring that consultation and following action occurs in the interest of country people. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (11.13 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will spend a few minutes responding to the debate on the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 [1995]. I thank senators for their comments on the bill, and I will provide information on the matters raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, in effect, makes relatively small changes to the National Health Act to allow a new agreement with pharmacies to operate if a suitable agreement is negotiated. The amendments in no way pre-empt parliament but simply set in place a structure within which an agreement can operate and, therefore, be negotiated. The administrative details of the agreement would be contained in determinations which are subject to parliamentary disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it is very difficult to negotiate an agreement if the legislation is not in place for it to operate. The government cannot accept the amendment as proposed by Senator Herron. The government fully supports the authority of the parliament to come to its own decision on legislation, and I have explained the circumstances behind these amendments. Since part of the current agreement ends at the end of this month, the amendments are very important. Negotiations on the details of the new agreement are currently under way with the peak pharmacy groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary changes proposed in the amendments are as follows. Firstly, to terminate the payments currently being offered to pharmacists when handing back approval numbers. Over 600 approval numbers have been cashed in during the current agreement. The number and quality of approved pharmacies is, therefore, much more satisfactory, with many of the pharmacies which have closed being small, inefficient businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, to permit the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to deal with matters wider than just dispensing fees. The amendments would allow the tribunal to consider allowances for other professional services which might evolve in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the concern that the administrative arrangements for such allowances must be carefully worked out. The first allowance will be for a regular medication review of residents in nursing homes. The need and value of this service has been proven in many studies. At this stage, the allocation referred to in the memorandum only reflects this initial function. The allowance will not commence until the administrative details are finalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pharmacy Guild, the Pharmaceutical Society and the Society of Hospital Pharmacists intend to form a society of consultant pharmacists. This society will establish the training standards and the standards of practice for pharmacists to be eligible for consideration for professional allowances where they have a contract for medication review with a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third primary change proposed in the amendments is to continue incentive payments for pharmacies operating in remote areas. The current allowances have been very successful in encouraging pharmacy services in isolated areas. In discussion with the Isolated and Essential Pharmacy Association, it was agreed to continue the current two allowances under the new names of remote and isolated pharmacy allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth change is to have a body of practising pharmacists to advise on application for new pharmacies to supply pharmaceutical benefits and professional allowances. The body, the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, would replace the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority. With a majority of members being practising pharmacists, it provides effective input by the profession into the circumstances under which an approval might be recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Pharmacy Guild and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the two big organisations representing community pharmacy, have been involved in the negotiations for a new agreement. Obviously in the remuneration aspects of the agreement the guild is the primary body with which the government negotiates. At all times the primary objective of the negotiations for both pharmacy and the government is to provide good access for the Australian community to pharmaceutical benefits through a well-distributed network of approved pharmacies to the benefit of community health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Valuable experience has been gained from the 4 1/2 years of the current agreement which has been used in formulating a new agreement. For example, it is intended to give much more flexibility in relocating approved pharmacies to places of need which will remove many of the tensions that have occurred with the current agreement. It will also remove such behaviours as leapfrogging where a few people relocated several short distances to get around the current requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without doubt, the current agreement has worked extremely well to provide a better distribution of pharmacies to supply pharmaceutical benefits. It has also provided stability and cooperation between government and community pharmacy. This has enabled community pharmacy to concentrate on improving health services and, therefore, health outcomes, which has benefited all consumers. The government is proposing one amendment to the bill and that is to permit a new agreement to operate up to five years instead of the four years as currently in the bill. The government has accepted pharmacies' view that five years is more consistent with business decisions such as the period of commercial leases. I commend the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>The requests for amendments are simple. They change the totals on several pages&mdash;pages 11, 15 and 16&mdash;as a consequence of changes on pages 26 and 27. These changes are the deletion of the appropriations for equipment and stores, defence production and defence facilities. It leaves behind the administration and defence housing appropriations for reasons that I have already outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of these changes is to reduce the defence appropriation from $214,880,000 to $13,339,000. This is a saving of $201,541,000. It is a huge amount of money. I have already given the substantive arguments in the second reading debate and remind senators that these additional appropriations are for needs that have arisen since the budget. They are needs that result from decisions of parliament requiring additional funds for some minor variation, although the government has a responsibility to have a contingency reserve for such purposes in its annual budget. It is normally item 9(c) in the outlay section of the main budget papers. Item 9(c), the contingency reserve, was $228 million in the last budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional appropriations may also represent unforeseen demand and unrestricted services such as unemployment payments. They may represent exceptional expenses such as drought relief. Only the defence housing and administration section of the requests appear to represent anything like this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence requests do not generally fall into any of these categories. I cannot see anything exceptional here or anything requiring urgent action. Several items should have been, and probably were, well known beforehand. If this is so, not including them in the budget is simply subterfuge to make the defence budget appear smaller. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In point of fact, in the last budget it was publicly announced that the defence budget would be smaller this year. Defence spending was supposed to be down. This may have been because of consistent criticism about the fact that defence seems to be immune to the cuts we see in other portfolios and the fact that many polls have shown that, while people are willing to pay more tax for services they value, they would like to see defence spending cut. In the last budget it was announced that defence spending would be cut by $163 million. Now we see that this was not true. There is an additional appropriation of nearly $215 million, meaning that defence spending did not go down, as announced; it is actually going up. There certainly appears little urgency or need to give this handout of over $200 million a few months before a new budget comes down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the combined defence budgets for Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines was $US8,471 million. In 1992-93 our defence budget was $9,435 million. With this additional appropriation, our defence budget this year will be $9,852 million. Next year the defence budget has been flagged to go up another four per cent, so it will be over $10 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of this money is for equipment. There are  problems with some of the equipment expenditures. In spite of what Senator Ray says, the issues I have generally raised are not philosophical questions about whether we should have such a huge Defence Force and put about 10c in every dollar into defence expenditure, although this question is worth asking. It is especially worth while asking in a time of peace when we are actively trying to sell weapons to our neighbours and are training them here and inviting them to our military exercises. It is especially worth while asking when both major parties express great concern over the budget and call for cuts in target areas such as child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that, in relation to the child-care rebate that Mr Beazley floated as an area for cuts, the entire program costs only $152 million&mdash;three-quarters of what Defence spends in this little extra top up before us. The proposed cuts in the child-care rebate were later toned down as `only means testing' which might conceivably save $1 million, yet here we are expected to hand over $200 million without a blink. It is $200 million here for equipment which is in addition to an annual budget for equipment of $3,677 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year the budget for equipment is estimated to be $4,152 million. That is over $4 billion a year, and just for equipment. By comparison, all public, primary and secondary schools got only $1,094 million this year, a reduction of 13 per cent, or about $200 million. When you add the public, primary and secondary schools costing about $1.1 billion to the $1.6 billion the federal government gives to private primary and secondary education, and add in all joint programs, Aboriginal programs and other types of programs for primary and secondary schools, the whole thing is only $3 billion, yet we spend over $4 billion on rifles, submarines and planes without thinking twice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look again at the figures for public schools, public primary and secondary schools, education for ordinary people between kindergarten and the end of high school. That budget is only about $1 billion. It went down this year by 13.3 per cent. Not only is the budget going down; last year's budget was underspent by $20 million. I hope no-one has the temerity to claim that this was because education is in such good shape. Class sizes are at record level and teachers are under immense pressure, with major strikes occurring in Western Australia over treatment and pay levels, and no matter what federal ministers say about state responsibility, the federal government is cutting funds and pushing its benchmarking and other `efficiency programs' which are only ways of saying that class sizes should go up as a way of cutting costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year not unique. The infrastructure in schools has been run down for years. Things are getting worse rapidly. Education was a major electoral issue in the ACT, with both major parties promising relief for parents having to pay parent contribution and engage in continuous fund raising activities even to keep their schools going. Yet class sizes have been moving inexorably from the high 30s to over 40 children in a class. That is not efficient. Whatever economists say about increased productivity, the quality of education goes down and the time the children spend is less productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriations are the area where the actual spending priorities and values of parliament are made quite clear. We do vote on these things and can question those priorities; we can recommend amendments. It is ultimately our responsibility that the education security of all children between the ages of five and 18, our future citizens, is given one quarter of the value that we give the need for new submarines and frigates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying clearly that the education security of our people is worth less than the ability to make war. We are saying that we need to build up our military force even further and spend four times what we do on public schools, when we already have the greatest military force in our region and at a time of peace when there are no potential threats. Let me make it clear that it is at the expense of our education system that we have decided to use resources in this way and not for education, health or even the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, there is the general problem of the budget. At this time, senators and members from both sides of both houses are calling for fiscal restraint. They are demanding that portfolios, like education&mdash;basic primary and secondary education for our children&mdash;must suffer greater fiscal restraint, must keep moving to bigger class sizes and must try to raise more and more money for basic needs from cake sales and parents' subscriptions. Rural medical services are being shut down. Urban hospitals, such as Woden which is located just up the road, are at crisis point. Public housing is suffering. There is no money for crisis care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both major parties are calling for the next budget to be a ruthless one, with social infrastructure being cut even further. If anyone listened to the atrocious press conference on greenhouse, they would realise that the federal government is not prepared to put its money where its mouth is on greenhouse reductions. The current account figures have been characterised as a crisis. At the same time, those who say that there is a crisis requiring strict fiscal management also say that they will not consider any new taxes or revenue. In such circumstances, how can this Defence request be justified&mdash;a request of $215 million, which is nearly three times the request of any other department in any of the appropriation bills before us? It is a massive amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, Defence might like this money, but is this really the best or most appropriate use for it? I can say in an unqualified way, I am certain that there are several other departments which would love to see this sort of money, which would use it to stem much of the erosion that has occurred. Health could use it easily. Housing and Regional Development could easily find worthy uses that would bring benefit in the future. Education would certainly use it. Why should Defence get it, without even offering a reason?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not been given reasons, neither here nor in the additional estimates, that meet anything like any proper process of accountability. We have been given a shopping list. I have serious concerns about some of the expenditure and feel that Defence has been largely obstructive in addressing concerns I have put in estimates committee and in questions on notice. Defence is generally extremely difficult to get any helpful answers from. I object to this. It does not give me any feeling that the hundreds of millions of dollars it now asks for will be well spent. For instance, ask Defence what the process is that it goes under to make these decisions, whether or not it does any kind of cost benefit analysis, whether or not it finds out whether its level of sourcing is actually leading in the right direction. Defence does not do it or, if it does, it is certainly not telling us about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Defence department that is quite happy to go out and buy Blackhawk helicopters without bothering to specify how it will use them. They are mainly to be used for long range applications, with the result that most of them are on the ground requiring maintenance. This is not an efficient use of scarce resources nor a responsible acquisition program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have Defence deciding to make its own subs and frigates at a huge premium. When the Anzac frigate project was announced, the unit cost per vessel was given as between $240 million and $285 million. This was at a time when the total project cost was given as $3.5 billion for eight vessels. If the same relativities between unit and project costs were to exist today, the unit cost of a frigate would be $320 million, while the project cost&mdash;the cost of getting these frigates the way Defence is doing it&mdash;would now be $540 million per ship. This would be $220 million per ship above the unit cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the costs of the ships sold to New Zealand were substantially less than those for which the Australian government paid. There seems to be about $1 billion extra here that is essentially a subsidy to the industry and can be counted as a cost to the self-reliance policy, as it is implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there are the sorts of problems that have been identified by the Auditor-General that may be characterised as excessive generosity to contractors, such as advances given on contracts, such as those that allowed the Australian Submarine Corporation to make $77 million in interest on government funds before it launched a submarine. I acknowledge that since the ANAO reports the defence capital equipment procurement manual has been changed to remedy some of these issues. But for me the problem remains that it is very hard to find out what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence never acknowledges a problem until it is publicly proved. With the Collins class submarines the total project cost is about $820 million per ship. In 1990, when the government was considering additional ships, the cost of these vessels was given as $400 million each. If we take this as the close to true unit cost of the submarines, converted to a current unit cost of $600 million we could say that we are again paying a premium of around $220 million per vessel, the cost of subsidising the defence version of self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to ask about these things. I ask in estimates and get the run-around. I am told that no answer can be given about why it is a good idea to spend this money designing a unique Collins class submarine instead of achieving the same broad military objectives in some other way with conventional equipment we can buy off the shelf. I am told I cannot get an answer because the Collins is unique. I cannot get an answer as to what makes it unique or why we need these features. I am asked to specify each option I want a comparison with, although I am asking what a $14 million per annum policy unit has done and why it was decided that this very expensive path of building our own was the best way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked about the frigates and I have been told I could not get an answer because there is nothing unique about an Anzac frigate; it is a conventional design. This is the level of response I get when I try to find out why we are going about equipping ourselves in this way, when it seems an expensive way to do things. Not only do I not get answers; I get personal abuse along the way. I am not alone in this. I know Senator Newman has had some kind of run-around when asking about Blackhawks, or the purchase of helicopter support ships. It is extremely difficult to get a straight answer to a straight question. One has to be both a linguistics expert specialising in military jargon and a mind reader to ask questions in a way Defence cannot avoid answering. Otherwise you get evasion. Even if you do get an answer, it is always on the basis of minimising the useful information transmitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do we get this sort of problem. There is the whole question of supported defence government business enterprises in the private defence industry.

I have the amendment now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms we certainly would be in favour of the Greens' amendment, but we have some problems with specifics. The Democrats for some years have looked at cuts in the defence budget but we have tried to target them specifically to programs to which we have a strong objection. However, we are not saying that we want no defence force at all. We are seeking to design a defence force which is truly appropriate to Australia's defence and security needs. The current defence force we have certainly is not that. In the bill which I have before the Senate we have sought to have a public inquiry so that the real needs of Australia's security might be examined on an as wide as possible basis, but as yet that bill has not been debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sought in our submission to the government last year to cut $90 million from the defence budget in the direction in which the Auditor-General has pointed to and identified possible savings. We would agree that the Department of Defence is simply not accountable, and that is one of the real complaints we have. We would obviously want to target things, as we have said previously, like the submarine program, but realise that that has advanced so far now that we wonder whether it is still a feasible target for cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek that clarification and, after I have spoken, Senator Margetts may give us a little more help in that direction. I could be persuaded to support the requested amendments, I think, if I could get that, although I agree with Senator Margetts that she has problems in answering those questions because really the department should have given us much clearer indication of where these appropriations were needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work that we have done certainly indicates that there are increases in the operating costs of all three services, as well as increased outlays on capital items. The causes of these increases are just too diverse to be very easily summarised here. It seems that some of the operating costs are due to unforeseen United Nations commitments in Mozambique and Rwanda. Others are due to additional joint exercises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we probably want to support additional appropriations for peacekeeping activities such as that involved in Rwanda, but I doubt that we would want to support additional joint exercises. I would agree with Senator Margetts that, if that means bringing soldiers from Indonesia to work with our Defence Force, we are opposed to that completely. Fancy teaching people who have butchered their own people how to do it more effectively! I just think that is an appalling proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have again a balancing act that we are trying to do on the floor of the Senate. I want to commend Senator Margetts for the work she did in the estimates committees, but I can hear her frustration: to have spent all that time working out questions and then to get fobbed off is a pretty frustrating exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the internal commitment to capital items is partly funded by an internal budget transfer, but it is unclear which areas of increase are due to project cost escalation. I would like to hear from the minister an explanation which would give us some indication of where some of these additional expenses are needed. I am aware&mdash;at least we were given some indication&mdash;that, for instance, there was an upgrading of the Orion aircraft to enable them to do coastal surveillance. Again, that would be one activity which we would support. It seems to me that that is something which is very much needed. But this is the problem: we are really trying to balance out information which is not available to us, which makes it very difficult for us to vote for the government's request for these increased appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in one piece of information I have on program 6 that, for instance, there is a reduction of $11,291,000 in new submarines, a reduction of $64,809,000 in the Anzac ships, but an increase of $90 million in the minehunter coastal ships. Again, we might approve of some of that reduction, but it is hard to do that. I note that there is an increase of $1,350,000 which is simply described as `increased provision in defence industry development activity'. What does that mean? I am sure I do not know. The sum of $107,000 is said to be for `miscellaneous minor variations'. I suppose that for the Department of Defence $100,000 is minor. It is certainly not minor if we can apply it to some of the activities which we believe are more appropriate. </PARA>

The concern with removing or voting against the other items in program 6&mdash;which entails such things as equipment and stores, defence production and defence facilities&mdash;is that it is not so much whether or not individual items for which these appropriations are being targeted have general support. Our concern is that the additional appropriations process and in fact the budget process are being abused by bringing these up as additional appropriations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asking that the government should not be able to abuse the process of additional appropriations. If the government has given no reason that this is appropriate in terms of using these particular expenditures as an urgent additional appropriation, the appropriate and right place for the government to put these requests is in the budget so that full public scrutiny is possible.

Within that there is a service allowance provision of some $41 million for the servicemen and servicewomen in the armed forces. That is an entitlement.

Therefore, it has been necessary to have the supplementary estimates before you today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence budget is determined and controlled largely on a global outlay basis, within which defence spending programs are to be accommodated. Within these global limits, there has traditionally been a degree of flexibility&mdash;it is not an unusual flexibility that we are talking about&mdash;to relocate expenditures to accord with changing priorities and circumstances. It is no new principle in terms of the budget estimates provisions. What has traditionally occurred when the preparation of budgets in all portfolios has taken place is an anticipation that there will be, depending on circumstances, additional appropriations. We do not, in effect, overestimate the moneys that will be needed in a particular budget departmental area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found some of the remarks made by the parliamentary secretary patronising to say the least. Senator Woodley and others would know how many hours I have spent in Defence estimate hearings. In some non-sitting weeks it has meant me travelling from Perth and spending a day with Senator Ray and then travelling back the next day. I can tell senators that I know of better ways to spend my time. That perhaps gives you an indication of how seriously we take this current level of expenditure and accountability in this portfolio. We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary mentioned that the Department of Defence does not overestimate the amount in department areas. That is correct. What it consistently does in many areas of major expenditure is underestimate the costs. That is why we have Black Hawks that cannot fly. That is why we have other equipment that cannot be serviced and other major operations that cannot operate in an efficient way and are therefore wasting taxpayers' money. That is not a philosophical problem; that is a wastage and inefficiency problem. It is an ongoing problem. The department tries to give one impression to the taxpayers and then actually does something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true: Defence does not regularly overestimate its budget, but, funnily enough, most other departments do. In recent years a number of departments have underspent their budget. They have suddenly found at the end of the year that 10 per cent of their budget has not been spent. What a surprise! That means that they can go into the next year looking as if they are either keeping the same level of expenditure or increasing it, when, in fact, they are putting it down. So it is cuts by deception. But that does not happen in Defence; it is increases by deception, and that is the general trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we oppose. We oppose this level of accountability which tries to do a mirror trick and convince the public. People are well aware. The EPAC survey should make the government well aware that people are very concerned about this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that there needs to be some changes. People in this parliament, who are elected representatives, need to get at least the same level and quality of information as those in the defence industry and the private industry. Those are the same principles. That is not cutsie, philosophical stuff. It is reality. It is about money.

If Senator Sherry thinks I am not serious and if he thinks we do not go into some detail of finding out what goes on in Defence, he can check the amount of questions we asked in both estimates and question time and he will see the level of reply that we got. As I keep saying, it is not a cutsie philosophical argument. It is about dollars and cents. It is about hundreds of millions of dollars. If Senator Sherry thinks that is not important and is just a silly little green philosophical argument, perhaps he does not think it is worth having proper scrutiny on that amount of money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my remarks by referring to what I said on behalf of the coalition at the time of the second reading debate on these appropriation bills. This is the third reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1994-95, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1994-95 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1994-95, which are commonly known as the additional estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reading debate I pointed out the fact that this was the first year in which we were following a set of parliamentary procedures for consideration of the budget bills consequent upon the budget being introduced in May rather than, as has always been the case in the past, in August. Because of that change in the timetable for the introduction and processing of the budget, there were a considerable number of changes made in terms of the way in which the parliament, and particularly the Senate, goes about its consideration of the appropriations. In particular, the significance of the additional estimates debates has been increased because it was only at the time of the presentation of the additional estimates towards the end of last calendar year that the full information on the government's spending proposals for the financial year 1994-95 became available. So we have had a greatly heightened increase in the significance of this additional estimates process and the ensuing debates, both in estimates committees and here in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 February this year, when speaking in the second reading debate, I pointed to the fact that many of the answers to questions that had been put to the government in the additional estimates hearings in November and early December were very late in being received prior to the supplementary additional estimates hearings that took place in February. I spoke in the second reading debate just a couple of weeks before those supplementary additional estimates hearings. I said at that time that we were very concerned that the supplementary estimates hearings were going to be frustrated by virtue of the fact that we did not have many of the necessary answers to the questions that had been put in the first set of hearings in November and December. My concerns, on behalf of the coalition, were heightened as events proceeded during February and March, and it was only last week that the supplementary hearings were finally concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would point out that we are finalising the passage of these bills today without having answers to many of the questions, which the government had to take on notice, that were put during the supplementary estimates hearings in February. To that extent, I would point out to the government that the coalition is being highly cooperative in facilitating the passage of these appropriation bills because, if one were strictly looking at the due processes that ought to be carried out before appropriation bills are passed&mdash;and that due process would involve receiving answers to all the questions that had been put during the consideration of the bills&mdash;then the government would not be in a position to ask for passage of these bills. Nevertheless, we are, in a spirit of cooperation, going ahead with facilitating the government's requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, looking at the whole process&mdash;going back to the early introduction of the budget in May last year and looking at the succeeding processing of the budget bills&mdash;the opposition is satisfied that the new arrangements have worked reasonably well to date. There certainly have been some hiccups along the way, not least, I must say, in the understanding by ministers&mdash;at least some of them&mdash;of the scope of questioning that was permitted in the course of the consideration. This was especially the case with the supplementary additional estimates hearings of the committee with which I am most involved&mdash;the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which deals with the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister who had responsibility for the conduct of the supplementary hearings of that committee was the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus. He also, of course, represents the Attorney-General in this place. He tried to gag the committee's proceedings when it met on 16 February. We lost well over an hour of very valuable committee time arguing with the minister about his lack of understanding of the whole nature of those supplementary hearing processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication of what he was saying&mdash;he was totally misinformed but I give him the benefit of the doubt; I think his prevarication in the estimates committee was based on a genuine misunderstanding on his part&mdash;was that what could be done in the supplementary estimates hearings, which were very consciously and very deliberately designed to be a very important part of the Senate's consideration of the budget, was totally contradictory to the standing orders of the Senate that had been determined back in August 1994. In the end he acquiesced in that matter, and so the proceedings continued, but had he had his way, then much of the necessary debate and consideration of the government's spending proposals, at least in those departments, would have been totally frustrated. That was the first real occasion on which the Senate had had the opportunity to look at many of the proposals in the detail that was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So that was a very worrying hiccup that occurred. I hope that those bugs in the system are due just to the newness of the system and I am confident that we will resolve those next time around. With the budget coming up in May we will have had one full year of the new procedure and I hope that the proceedings of the parliament in terms of the consideration of the 1995 budget will build on the improvements that we started in 1994 but which will need further building on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That part-time Prime Minister Paul Keating's Canberra of March 1995 will prove to be what was Gough Whitlam's Bass of 1974. The Bass by-election in 1974 or early 1975 set the inevitable scene for the demise of the Whitlam government&mdash;arguably the most incompetent government until this one in Australia's history. In last Saturday's result in Canberra there was a fall of 22 per cent in the Labor vote. That means that Labor's share of the vote fell by 22 per cent but, in fact, it fell almost in half when you look at the actual arithmetic. I do not think there is any doubt at all that the significance of that vote and the result, including, in particular, on the two-party preferred basis, will prove to be as significant as was the Bass result 20 years earlier which led to an essentially necessary change of government in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy for Australia from last Saturday's result is that the Prime Minister seems to have no idea of the reason for that result. There are many reasons for it. Right at the top must be two factors. First is the economic incompetence and policy failures of this government in its 12 years of office which have led to mainstream Australia being brutally savaged in economic terms through its standard of living and quality of life. Throughout all that time, the single architect of that misery has been the current Prime Minister, Mr Keating, because he was the Treasurer throughout virtually all the preceding time of the present government under the prime ministership of Bob Hawke. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator McGauran says, there is great concern in the ranks opposite about the situation. There is great concern about the Prime Minister's total refusal to accept blame for last Saturday's result. Instead, if we believe the press reports today&mdash;I am certain that they are correct and on good authority&mdash;he blamed everyone but himself. He blamed Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker did not exercise enough discipline in the House of Representatives to make the Prime Minister look good so that the Prime Minister really did not have to thump the table and scream and shout in the most unparliamentary ways possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Mr Speaker is having such difficulty in the House of Representatives is very importantly because of the sheer arrogance and brutality of this Prime Minister in his whole approach to the parliamentary process and his whole job. The Prime Minister blamed Mr Speaker. He accused the person who probably did more than anyone else to get him into the prime ministership of taking 30 pieces of silver to attack him. He has drawn attention to and blamed everyone other than himself. If he does not realise that it is as a result of his economic policies and the sheer arrogance and out-of-touchness that he displays in everything he does, and if he does not make a monumental change in his whole attitude and policy approach, there is no doubt that the massacre of Labor in December 1975 will look like chicken feed compared with what will rightly happen to Labor at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the complacency of the government, and the Prime Minister in particular, as to the economic situation in this country that is really of the very greatest concern. Yesterday in question time&mdash;this is but one of many examples that I could draw the Senate's attention to&mdash;in response to a question from my leader, Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, claimed this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy is in a much sounder fundamental shape now than it was then&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in the mid- to late 1980s&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as a result of the decade long attention that we have paid to basic fundamental economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is of the most outrageously inaccurate and misleading nature. The government never backs up these statements with hard facts. Look at the hard facts of the situation today&mdash;the fundamentals of the Australian economy&mdash;compared with the situation a decade ago in the mid-1980s, let alone the structure of the economy that this Labor government inherited from the Fraser government in March 1983. A comparison shows that it is simply not true&mdash;indeed, it is totally the opposite&mdash;to say that the economy is now in a much sounder fundamental shape than it was then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at a few of the key statistics. The government has been making much of the fact that, according to it, more than 500,000 new jobs have been created in the last two years and that this beats its estimate of how long it would take to create that number of new jobs by one year. That sounds pretty impressive stuff, doesn't it? But, when you dig below the surface, you find a very different situation. The fact is that the level of employment in Australia today is only 248,000 more than it was at the time of peak employment in 1990. That was before the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister, Paul Keating, pulled the levers very deliberately, very brutally and totally unnecessarily that led to the worst recession in 60 years and the greatest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be almost inconceivable that a government would not have been able to see the growth of 500,000 new jobs in a two-year period at a time of recovery from such a low base as it had subjected the economy to. What we have seen is normal growth out from the bottom of a very low, depressed cycle. It was a depression caused by the total economic policy failure and mismanagement of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of employment is not all that much more than what it was at its high level five years ago. The level of employment today is only 248,000 more than it was five years ago, which is an average of less than 50,000 jobs a year. When you look at the number of people coming onto the job market, you see that there is nowhere near the level of job creation necessary to provide sustained employment for the present work force and the newly emerging work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is even worse when you look at the structure of employment. More than half of the 500,000 new jobs created in the last two years have been part-time jobs. The growth in employment has come from part-time employment&mdash;not full-time employment. There are not too many families in our nation who can operate a budget and keep their heads above the poverty line under the policies of this government in a full-time job, let alone in a part-time job. Let us hear no more of this absolute nonsense from the government about its so-called great success in job creation. It is greatly overstating the real situation and it is greatly understating the gravity of the employment situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is reinforced when you look at the unemployment figures. More than 800,000 Australians are still unemployed. On top of that figure, there are at least another 800,000 to one million people who are underemployed. Those figures include those people who do not work for even one hour a week. If you have a part-time casual job where someone pays you for two hours of employment a week, you are not classified as unemployed. The official statistics grossly understate the seriousness of the employment situation in Australia. The job situation is extremely worrying, and it continues to be so. Nothing the government is doing is having any sustainable impact on improving that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, what Senator Evans said in response to that question from Senator Hill was wrong. I was going to say that he misled the parliament. I am not sure that I am allowed to say that he lied to the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there is the misleading implication that, in terms of the interest rate side of things, we are doing okay in comparison with other countries against whom our investors have to compete in getting a return on their capital investment in the production of goods and services, and so on. The fact is that this government has put our investors, producers and wealth creators in an increasingly tight bind, an increasingly difficult situation, to achieve what we all wish them to achieve on our behalf, because our interest rate cost structure is higher than that of virtually any of the other countries against whom we are competing in this highly competitive international world. So much for interest rates and the very false claims of the government pertaining to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue to which I draw attention is the situation in relation to the balance of payments. The balance of payments&mdash;that is, our accounts with the rest of the world&mdash;is in as bad a shape as it has ever been. We are racking up deficits, debts to the rest of the world; we are going into hock to the rest of the world by more than $2 billion every month of the year. The government started off this year by saying that our deficit with the rest of the world was going to be $18 billion. It said that at the time of the budget last May when it was talking about the 1994-95 financial year. Then, subsequently, a couple of months ago, it revised that estimate to $26 billion&mdash;and at the rate we are going that will be an underestimate too. There is every possibility that the figure for the year will come in at $28 billion to $29 billion. That, as a proportion of our total national income, our gross domestic product, what we produce, is about six per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no country in the Western world that has a balance of payments deficit as a proportion of its national output of anything like six per cent. The Americans are terribly worried about their balance of payments situation, and their deficit is, I think, 2.3 per cent of GDP. The only country in the world that exceeds us in the so-called Western world, or among the OECD countries, is Mexico. I think its figure is about 6 1/2 per cent&mdash;and we are rapidly approaching that figure. From the last few months we all know of the dreadful difficulties that Mexico has got itself into&mdash;how the peso has plunged, how the economy is in absolute chaos. That has all happened because of its external situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Keating, the then Treasurer, said in May 1986 that we were heading into banana republic land; we were going down the Argentinian road. I would just say that, if we were half as good as Argentina is today, we would be doing pretty well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Government in the Senate yesterday had the hide to come into this chamber and tell us that the economic fundamentals today are better than they were a decade ago. What absolute nonsense that is. I wonder what page of the foreign debt figures he was looking at. Doesn't he know that Australia today has a foreign debt to the rest of the world&mdash;we owe the rest of the world&mdash;more than $170,000 million. I repeat: $170,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this lot came to power in March 1983, our debt to the rest of the world was $23,000 million. That was an okay figure. It was not the top of the tree, but it was a highly manageable figure. Our debt to the rest of the world today under Labor is eight times higher than it was when Labor came to office. No country in the world, I think I can say with confidence, has a larger foreign debt than we have. The one thing you can say with absolute certainty about foreign debt is that nothing reduces a nation's independence and sovereignty more than being in debt to other countries, to foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an arrogant, part-time, out of date, past his use-by date Prime Minister who struts the world stage and tells the chancellor of the strongest economy in the world how to run his country, how to plan his architecture. He shoves aside the Prime Minister of one of the Asian tigers who is really showing us how to go about doing business, the Prime Minister of Singapore, so that he can attack John Howard and Kerry Packer. A fellow like that is running the country and trying to tell us that he is supporting and working for a more independent Australia, yet he has been the chief architect of policies that have put at risk Australia's independence and sovereignty more than any other public figure in the history of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that comes together in the value of the Australian dollar&mdash;how it is valued in terms of other currencies. That is of critical importance to us because the value of the Australian dollar determines how much we can sell our goods overseas for and how much we have to pay for the goods that we buy from overseas. My colleague Senator Gibson in his comments will go into this in much more detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy failures I have been talking about have led to a major decline in the value of the Australian dollar. That has certain inevitable results. Putting downward pressure on the Australian dollar for all of those reasons greatly increases pressure to increase interest rates. If you have a falling dollar you have almost inevitably a rising interest rate. It puts upward pressure on inflation, so inflation is likely to rise inevitably as a result of it. It puts downward pressure on investment because the cost of investment becomes increasingly difficult. It causes a reduction in economic growth and an inevitable increase in unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of over 1,000 severely drought affected farmers from the Upper Hunter district of New South Wales. These farmers and small business people have labelled the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, the most hated man in the district. They are at a total loss to understand why this Labor government has abandoned them to live without hope and in desperate rural poverty. The region includes Muswellbrook, Scone, Murrurundi and Merriwa and it remains in absolute and comprehensive drought. Farmers have now faced four consecutive years of this drought. Their plight is magnified because this ALP government has refused and continues to refuse to lift a finger to help with public policy. Minister Collins will not move to grant exceptional circumstance drought relief to aid these farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 February I led a delegation to meet him. He heard the desperate stories first-hand and he at that time appeared to react with compassion. He promised a response from RASAC, the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee, by early March. We are now in late March and nothing has happened. All my inquiries to members of the delegation this morning say that Collins is a do-nothing minister. Delegation members say that his promised access to household support&mdash;he promised this in his office&mdash;is still not available. Treasury has said that no more money is available for drought relief and Collins has strung along these Upper Hunter farmers in a disgraceful way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anger and bitterness in the Upper Hunter against Minister Collins are now entrenched as farm families have no option but to beg for assistance. This federal Labor government has turned its back on this region. It is the Hunter electorate and voters will not let Eric Fitzgibbon, the Labor MP, forget. His 14 per cent margin in Hunter was previously looking very safe but, after the Canberra by-election and the amount of heat generated up there about this matter now, there could be a very big swing to the coalition in Hunter at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one should doubt the extreme severity of the drought in the Upper Hunter. In January, when other areas got about six inches of rain, the Upper Hunter got under one inch. It has moved in this time from what has been called the green drought&mdash;that is, when you get some green pick that is not of much use to cattle at all because it is so short&mdash;to a dust bowl again, with most of the farm dams completely dry. The region now, on the natural pattern, faces a dry winter; and still no exceptional drought relief comes from this ALP government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means in stark terms that these people will be borrowing money just to put food on the table. They will have to accept welfare from Farmhand, if there is any money left in the fund, from the Samaritans and from other charities. They will be borrowing money to keep stock alive, to buy grain and fertiliser for cereal crop planting, and to agist breeding stock cattle. Farmers in this region already have massive debt levels, many above $200,000 since the start of the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister cannot say that this is a no-hope area for viable farming. Prior to the drought most of the farms were 100 per cent viable and making money. This is some of the best agricultural and grazing land in Australia&mdash;but not during a drought; and we have no relief from the government. These people now need a drought interest subsidy, and the minister is denying this very vital lifeline that they need to stay viable and come back after the drought ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me cite an example from a member of the recent delegation to the minister. He is a beef cattle producer from near Scone and he was 100 per cent viable with nil debt before the drought. This drought and lack of federal aid have crippled him and his family financially. They are now $150,000 in debt. His herd has gone down from 600 to 400, with another 150 to be sold next week. The foundation of his future, his breeding heifers, has been decimated. He is now forced to sell his breeding heifers on a crashing cattle market in Scone, with prices falling to 15c a kilo this week. He is selling these cattle at a loss, having borrowed money to keep them alive and in some reasonable condition during this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scenario is repeated with a thousand families across the Upper Hunter. The Samaritans in the Hunter are trying valiantly to fill the mammoth gap left by the minister's callous disregard for their critical situation. Cec Shevells, from the Samaritans, says that the drought position in the Upper Hunter is worse than six months ago. The Samaritans are now providing 95 per cent of their relief effort to Upper Hunter farm families. Mr Shevells is astonished that this area is not included in the exceptional circumstances criteria. They are providing cash grants, deliveries of hay and water. They are also providing voluntary labour to farmers who are hospitalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This level of support cannot continue. This picture of real plight is desperate, and Collins must fix this up now. The money must be found from the finances of the federal government when these people are declared, as they should be, to be in an exceptional drought area. I demand in the Senate today that Minister Collins give a response to his undertaking made to farmers from the Upper Hunter on 1 February 1995. I will not rest in this Senate until this hideous wrong is corrected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to speak about the fact that last week was Seniors Week in many states and also Arthritis Week. I suppose there was an apt and timely connection between those two events, as many seniors do, after all, suffer from crippling and severe arthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases and disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and ankylosing spondylitis. One of the greatest misconceptions, however, is that arthritis is restricted to the elderly population. It most certainly is not. Not by any stretch of the imagination can one close one's ears and eyes to the fact that a whole range of people of middle or young ages are severely disabled by this disease, which is by far Australia's most common.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following Arthritis Week and given that this disease is one of the most under-funded of all, I would like to take a few moments to highlight this important matter in the Senate, especially given that the government does not seem to take too much interest in it in terms of research, facilities or practical care options such as the home and community care program. I have raised a number of these issues consistently over quite some time in estimates committees. I am concerned that no change is taking place and we are not seeing any increased funding for this very serious disease. The aim of Arthritis Week was to focus on Australia's most common chronic disease and to let Australia's two million sufferers know that they are not alone with their pain and restricted mobility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although arthritis is more common in older people, more than 100,000 people aged between 15 and 65 years are classified as being severely or profoundly handicapped by arthritis. The cost burden of this is not one which society can escape. At a cost to the Australian community of around $4 1/2 billion per year, it is clear that arthritis and similar diseases place a significant strain on health resources, particular when the disease goes unmanaged and when sufferers do not receive the information they need to manage their disease as best they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I come back to the role of Arthritis Week. It was especially important in this respect: people like Mr Bill Willcox, the National Director of the Arthritis Foundation of Australia, have an ongoing commitment&mdash;I commend them&mdash;to promoting better health for the sufferers of arthritis in Australia. Without such help, who knows what the statistics might be. The Arthritis Foundation is doing superb work in helping people to deal with the effects of arthritis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already there is cause for concern. Today I would like to quote a few of the statistics. Four million Australians suffer from some form of musculoskeletal disease, two million suffer from arthritis or rheumatism, 1.2 million suffer from disability as a result of their disease and more than 750,000 are handicapped as a result of arthritis. Musculoskeletal disease is the second most common cause of people visiting a doctor and accounts for nine per cent of all visits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Arthritis Foundation estimates that the government spends about 14 cents per sufferer on research into arthritis and similar diseases. The foundation would like to see this increase appreciably and believes that donations for medical research should be given the same tax treatment as investment in commercial research. Surely these are things that need to be very seriously considered by the government, considering the number of people who are so severely affected by this disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can make an interesting comparison in research funding, according to the most recent data available, which is dated September 1994, the cumulative total of HIV sufferers was 18,530 and, allowing for AIDS deaths in that period, the number was 14,704. A sum of $13.186 million was spent on HIV/AIDS research alone in 1994-95. That equates to $896 per sufferer, just in the past year. Of course, that does not take into account the other funds which are spent on state hospital care, blood transfusions and education programs. That is on research alone&mdash;simply on research. That is probably more funds than an arthritis sufferer would see in a lifetime. I think we really do need to look at the way in which arthritis is being funded, or underfunded, because these people are being severely affected in their day-to-day lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An ABS study of women's health has shown that the second most common cause of long-term ill health is arthritis. Among the seven most common complaints is unspecific back trouble and other diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connected tissue. The study also found that a total of 38.2 per cent of women with long-term ill health have a musculoskeletal condition. By the age of 15, back trouble is the most common cause of ill health in women and by 35, arthritis is the fourth most common cause. By the age of 45, arthritis is the second most common cause and remains so for all subsequent age groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For every 1,000 Australian females, 152.3 days were spent by female patients in hospital for obstetric matters. Hospitalisation for diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue totalled 95.7 days. This is a very serious problem. A study showing that hospitalisation for musculoskeletal diseases is second only to hospitalisation for obstetric matters for women really does start to highlight the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In women aged between 45 and 54 years, this is the most common reason for consulting a doctor. Any of us who have known anyone, or know anyone now, who suffers from this disease, knows the pain and the suffering they are going through and knows that they really do quite genuinely need the help and the research to continue into this dreadful disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, we are not simply talking about a disease which is restricted, as I said before, to the elderly. It is one that is limiting the lifestyle of younger people, some of them very young. There are some children of only four, five or six who can hardly walk, who can hardly move. There are so many reasons why research needs to be extended. In the light of these alarming statistics, Mr Wilcox claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is astonishing that a medical condition as prevalent as arthritis and with such a profound impact on society should remain as poorly served as it is by the health care delivery system and that perhaps it is that a completely inaccurate stereotype of discomfort and inconvenience exists. Perhaps it is that it is incorrectly seen as not causing death. Perhaps it is that it has simply not been defined as either wholly within the health care system or not completely within the disability service system.</PARA>
<PARA>A whole range of questions are being raised as to the way in which this disease is actually perceived and viewed in the community. Nowhere is this more evident than in the limited access arthritic people have to home and community care programs. At the last round of estimates, I was asked to provide examples of this limitation. I will repeat some of those examples here. These is a small, anecdotal collection of cases which have been gathered by the foundation's national director from a number of states. These are but a few of the cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case 1 is of Mrs G, who is 45 years old and has rheumatoid arthritis. She needs care and assistance for normal daily activities, including help with the toilet and the shower. Her husband cannot afford full-time care for her. She can only get domiciliary care two days a week and her other alternative is to be placed in a nursing home and thus separated from her husband. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case 2 is of Mrs M, who is 30 years old with a seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old twins. She has severe rheumatoid arthritis. When she moved to a new house, her home help hours were reduced and the reason given was that the new house had no floor coverings. Mrs M is wheelchair bound. She has had hip, knee and shoulder replacements and is awaiting elbow surgery. Her home help hours have not been increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case 3 is of Mrs B, who has been assessed as needing home help but is still waiting for assistance 18 months down the track. Case 4 is of Mrs A, who has had three hip replacements and cannot bend down but has been refused home help on the grounds that she does not fit the criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case 5 is of Miss T, who is 48 and has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for 33 years. Her mobility is severely restricted; she lives alone and has no relatives who are able to support her. Following spinal surgery, she required a night carer for six to eight weeks but limited funding reduced this period of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case 6 is of Mrs J, who is badly crippled in the hands, knees and shoulders. She gets an hour and a half's assistance per week for house cleaning. She has a mentally retarded daughter who suffers from bouts of extreme epilepsy when she fits seven or eight times per day and vomits often. At this time she has asked for more help but has been told there are no more funds available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite these as actual cases. I, for one, would not like to be in the desperate positions of all six cases to which I have referred. Of course, they are probably just the tip of the iceberg and many of us would know of other cases. Many people out there simply accept the decision not to grant home and community care services. They take it no further and they are the ones who suffer in silence. They are home and, sadly, many of them are home alone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in the discussion of matters of public interest to speak about the tax implications of converting accrued leave entitlements to superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At the 1994 annual general meeting of the Queensland Professional Credit Union, a member asked the board to explain why the superannuation payments to directors had increased by 613 per cent for the 1993-94 income year. The managing director, Mr Gordon Rutherford, responded that it represented a payment to him for long service leave and annual leave which he had converted to superannuation. It seems that the leave entitlements that had accrued to Mr Rutherford had been converted and paid as employer's superannuation contributions to Mr Rutherford's superannuation fund. The member who raised the question thought that this was somewhat unusual and, subsequent to the annual general meeting, wrote to the chairman of the credit union's board to confirm that the transaction had been approved by the board and asked whether or not there were any tax implications. The chairman, Mr Lee, wrote back to the member advising that the board had indeed approved the conversion of Mr Rutherford's accrued leave entitlements to superannuation and that there were no tax implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wondering whether the credit union had discovered a tax planning tool for executives, the member then wrote to the deputy commissioner of taxation seeking advice on whether such an arrangement had any tax implications. The tax office wrote back and advised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not possible to make an effective salary sacrifice of an entitlement that has already accrued. Therefore if a person has an accrued [leave entitlement] a payment of any amount of that accrued entitlement to a superannuation fund will constitute salary and wages in the hands of the employee and would be an employee contribution to the fund rather than an employer contribution.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears that the only plausible explanation for such a conversion of accrued leave entitlements to superannuation is that the individual has somehow extinguished the personal tax liability, and the only tax paid is the 15 per cent by the superannuation fund. The tax saving to the individual is not trivial; if the individual is on the highest marginal tax rate, the saving is 33.4c in the dollar. I will leave it to honourable senators to work out the amount of tax saved on the payment of almost $80,000 in this case. The only problem is that such an arrangement is contrary to advice the credit union member had received from the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That member and two others were concerned that the credit union accounts for 1994 did not make sufficient disclosure about the nature of the payment to directors&mdash;that is, the conversion of accrued leave to superannuation&mdash;and that the credit union might somehow be in breach of tax law. These individuals then took this matter to the relevant regulatory body, the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the matter of the conversion of accrued leave to superannuation, the QOFS wrote that it had investigated the matter. It stated that the `conversion' was approved by the board and that, in addition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . independent professional advice was obtained from KPMG, Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA>It added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to any tax implications this is a matter strictly between the Board and its auditors KPMG Peat Marwick.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the letter that the member had received from the tax office was also referred to the QOFS, the QOFS made no mention of the apparent conflict between the tax office view and the credit union's arrangement. I wonder why the QOFS seems unconcerned that the credit union had entered into an arrangement that may be in breach of tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The credit union members also took the matter to the Australian Financial Institutions Commission, which similarly showed little concern about the apparent conflict between the tax office advice and the credit union's action. The commission suggested that as the credit union had acted on professional advice it had acted properly, and if that advice is subsequently found to be wrong then the credit union has the right to take action against its advisers. But that was not the point that these concerned members were trying to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of important issues that arise from the circumstances that I have outlined here. Of concern is the way in which the two regulatory bodies have treated the Queensland Professional Credit Union members' complaints. These two organisations, which have a watchdog role over the activities of credit unions and building societies, appear to be unconcerned that the QPCU may have entered into an arrangement that is in breach of tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the attitude of these regulators does give cause for alarm, there is another aspect to this matter that is even more alarming. That is the significant policy implications for both superannuation and taxation, and perhaps even industrial relations. In fact, in terms of the industrial relations issue there are a number of questions which I would like to put on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is: can an employee and employer change a contract of employment to swap one entitlement for another? I do know the answer to that: it is yes. That is why salary packaging is such big business. Can they repackage leave entitlements? That is more interesting, because leave entitlements are governed by state and federal legislation. In Queensland, for example, the minimum legislative requirements are three weeks annual leave per year and 13 weeks long service leave after 15 years service. These entitlements cannot be traded away or repackaged. Even the Victorian legislation of Jeff Kennett guarantees recreation leave and long service leave. As far as I am aware, these conditions apply for all employees, so the issue is that state industrial law and federal tax law may have been breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point worth making is that these sorts of deals will become more attractive because of the decision in the 1993 budget to tax accrued recreation leave and long service leave at marginal tax rates rather than at a concessional rate. The Democrats were generally opposed to the measure, but even in its amended form it is still intended to earn the government an extra $170 million plus from 1995-96 onwards. This money could be at risk. Let me emphasise that if employees are able to convert accrued leave entitlements to superannuation in order to obtain a major tax break then this could represent substantial tax revenue lost to the government. It would also introduce further inequities in the superannuation system. Those in the higher tax brackets stand to gain a lot more than low income earners. Also, it would be unlikely that low income earners would be given the option by their employers of making a payment to superannuation in lieu of taking annual leave or long service leave. Again, it is the high income earners who gain the major benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the potentially widespread ramifications of such arrangements, I put the following question to the Treasurer. If an employee's accrued leave entitlements are converted to employer superannuation contributions, then is it possible for the converted amount to be assessed for taxation in the hands of the superannuation fund rather than as personal income in the hands of the employee? If the answer to this question is no, then I have a further question. As highlighted by the recent Goodman Fielder case, there are no legal requirements in Australia for public disclosure of detailed information about the salary packages of directors and senior executives. In the absence of full disclosure, and given that conversions of executives' accrued leave to superannuation are likely to be relatively difficult to detect, what mechanisms does the tax office have in place to detect such transactions when they occur?</PARA>

I invite any of my parliamentary colleagues to view a video on the areas I am talking about from the south-west of Western Australia by tuning their Parliament House office monitors to channel 8 at 1.30 p.m. today. Anyone who is listening can contact my office to borrow the video or arrange a viewing. The video, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Australia's forests</EMPHASIS>, has been produced by the WA Small Business and Enterprise Association. It shows some of the beautiful south-west forests scheduled for logging in 1995 and the devastation of areas that have been logged. Included are revealing aerial shots showing the extent of logging and clear-felling in the south-west. I am very glad I was able to speak before 1.30. If anybody has heard this part of my speech, I urge them to spare a few minutes to watch that video.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The first is a copy of an advertisement, signed by 280 people, which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on Monday, 20 February 1995. The advertisement calls for a moratorium on logging and road construction in all forests with significant old-growth or wilderness values. Signatories, who also subsidised the cost of the advertisement, came from a range of community sectors, from 40 Perth suburbs and over 15 towns in the south-west and north-west of the state. The range of sectors represented includes media, business, tourism, the legal profession, the church, the arts, farming, sport, medicine, universities, science, local government and state parliament. Others, including people in the timber industry, made donations of support but did not want their names to appear.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, today I want to raise my concerns about responses I have had from the Australian Securities Commission to three complaints I have made in relation to the Keating piggery group of companies and actions by Mr Achilles Constantinidis, Mr Keating's 50 per cent partner in those companies until Mr Keating `disposed' of his interests to Mr Constantinidis in March of last year. Most of these actions relate to the period when Mr Keating was the half owner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first complaint I made to the Australian Securities Commission was that Mr Constantinidis held himself out to be an officer of Parkville Stud Pty Ltd, a company that is simply not listed on the Australian Securities Commission database as ever having existed under this or any other name. I sent the ASC copies of employment separation certificates for three workers signed by Mr Constantinidis on behalf of Parkville Stud Pty Ltd, a non-existent company. Of course, it is illegal to hold yourself out to represent a company that does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second complaint was that Mr Constantinidis held out that this non-existent company, Parkville Stud Pty Ltd, was the employer at the Woodlands Piggery at Kootingal near Tamworth and this, of course, was evidenced&mdash;I always believe in providing the evidence&mdash;by taxation group certificates in three names for the income years 1992-93 and 1993-94. For all but three months of that two-year period, Mr Keating was the half owner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third complaint is that Mr Keating's partner, Mr Constantinidis, is listed as a director and secretary of a company named Parkville Pig Stud Pty Ltd. This does have an ACN number; it is actually a real company; the number is 059356946. When I wrote my letter to the ASC, this company had failed to file its annual return by the due date. This company is claimed by Mr Constantinidis to have taken over the Woodlands Piggery on 1 July 1994 and it was registered on 8 March 1993&mdash;that is, nine months after Parkville Stud Pty Ltd was held out to be the employer at Woodlands Piggery. It was due to file an annual return on 8 October 1994 but, according to the search that I made on 3 January this year, this return was still outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to file an annual return means that the identify of the ultimate owner of Parkville Stud Pty Ltd had not yet been placed on the public record by the ASC, although this matter happened to be material in attempting to assess the position of three former employees who had taken action against the company in relation to wrongful dismissal. Clearly, it is of great relevance to other employees of the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out to the ASC, these matters affect the integrity of the ASC's database and are of public concern. Clearly, the non-existent company cannot be dismissed as a clerical error, as Parkville Pig Stud Pty Ltd is only stated by Mr Constantinidis, according to a statutory declaration to the court, to have acquired the Woodlands Piggery in 1994, whereas Parkville Stud Pty Ltd, the non-existent company, is shown as the employer from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response I got from the ASC was incredibly inadequate. It said, among other things, this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is obvious that one or more documents prepared under the name Parkville Stud Pty Ltd in fact are incorrect to the extent that no company by that precise name exists.</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you, ASC. You have confirmed what I knew. The ASC goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you have advised, there is a company called Parkville Pig Stud Pty Ltd. The ASC has been advised that Parkville Stud&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the non-existent company&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was, at the time, a division of Browne and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd and, consequently, the employer name shown on the documents should correctly have been that company. The tax file number&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Goodness me! Do not tell me this is coming up again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shown on that document&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which was not revealed to me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in fact relates to Browne and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the ASC has made a mistake. I do not think it means tax file number; I think it means group certificate number. The ASC goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a breach of the Corporations Law to state that a company is a registered company if it is not. However&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is what really concerns me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ASC has taken the view that the context in which such offence occurred should be taken into account and in particular, regard should be had as to any consequences that might flow from such an incorrect name. Our judgment in this instance is that no particular damage was caused&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>by this illegal act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to any person as a direct result of the incorrect name being shown, particularly given that the tax file number was correct for the Browne and Hatton Group. The ASC does not, therefore, intend that any action be taken against any person in relation to these particular documents.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely incredible. At the end of the previous paragraph, the Senate will note that the ASC said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax file number shown on the document in fact relates to Browne and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>In the paragraph I have just read it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . particularly given the tax file number was correct for the Browne and Hatton Group.</PARA>
<PARA>A different company altogether. This is the problem that has been before the industrial relations court, why some workers of this group have been cheated out of proper payment. What intrigues me is the further remark by the ASC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory philosophy of the ASC is designed to ensure compliance with requirements generally for the lodgment of documents to ensure an accurate database.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have clear evidence of inaccuracy and the ASC failing to take action. The letter then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that other proceedings are either proposed or are in train by former employees of the Group.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the ASC acknowledges that this deception, this cheating, this pretending that a company exists that did not exist is of relevance and substance to the extent that proceedings are either proposed or are in train by former employees against the group and yet it pretends that no particular damage was caused to any person. I have never struck such nonsense from a government commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerning the assertion in the letter that the tax file number shown on the document relates to Browne and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd, the evidence I have is that the group certificate number of Browne and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd is 17577217, but that the group certificate number for the Browne and Hatton Group is 15434622&mdash;a totally different number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect the Australian Securities Commission to get its act in order. This is not a matter that I just suddenly brought up. I have been raising the consistent breaches of the ASC requirements by Mr Keating's piggery group for years and the Australian Securities Commission still cannot get it right. The ASC goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission has also followed up the returns of various of the companies in the Browne and Hatton Group and I am advised that 1994 returns for those various companies have all now been lodged with the exception of Poyntell Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a company of which Mr Constantinidis is a director:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several of those returns are subject to queries by the commission as to some of the information shown in the return.</PARA>
<PARA>The ASC is at it again. This group has consistently failed to report properly and accurately to the Australian Securities Commission and, quite frankly, nothing effective has been done to prevent it. Sure, the group has received penalty notices&mdash;I acknowledge that&mdash;and it has paid its penalties. However, there has been no prosecution. These are just automatic penalties, automatic to the extent that Mr Constantinidis did not pay his for something like 18 months until I raised it in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there have been consistent, deliberate breaches of the ASC requirements by Mr Constantinidis and his group, both during the period Mr Keating was a half owner and after Mr Keating `disposed' of his half interest. It is interesting that he did not ever use the word `sell'. The ASC letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of the returns are already available for searching through the ASC database and it is anticipated that other returns will shortly be available upon receipt of the additional information. The non-lodgement of Poyntell is also being followed up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1994 annual return for Parkville Pig Stud Pty Ltd was lodged out of time, as you had advised. A penalty notice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>another penalty notice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for failure to lodge on time was issued to that company on 30 January 1995 in accordance with usual procedures of the Commission relating to the non-lodgement or the late lodgement of returns.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not incredible that after all of that has gone on in this chamber, after all the revelations about this group&mdash;the Keating piggery group&mdash;consistently breaching ASC requirements, they are still at it. They still cannot get their returns in on time. Their returns still require further examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am intrigued to note that the company which is shown in the documents as being the shareholder in Parkville Pig Stud Pty Ltd is called Spearhawk Pty Ltd. I must say that that is a marvellous name. Mr Keating's former piggery company is now owned by Spearhawk and that is what Mr Keating did to Mr Hawke: he surely speared him. I do not know what humorist selected that name. Spearhawk Pty Ltd is a two-dollar paid up company. It is entirely owned by another company called Sephrenia Pty Ltd. We know nothing of Sephrenia as it is an exempt audited company and is not required to provide any details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is this: how can it possibly be that the ASC can refrain from taking action against a group of companies that are habitually in breach of its requirements? In particular, how can they pretend that no particular damage was caused to any person as a direct result of the incorrect name being shown? The fact is that these employees have been massively disadvantaged. They pursued the wrong entity for wrongful dismissal. That resulted in a day being totally wasted in the industrial court. The argument presented by the Keating piggery group was, `Nah ne nah, you've sued the wrong one of us. It was our fourth index finger instead of our third index finger.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a disgraceful situation where workers who were employed by a company that was half owned by Mr Keating have been cheated by the use of this kind of device&mdash;that is, the wrong company name. The former employees were pressured by their union to accept an inadequate settlement because the cost of finding out the real employer was extraordinarily large. The employer was hidden by this improper use of a front company that did not exist. There have been costs and people have been disadvantaged. As I understand it, the matter will come up again before the industrial court next week. This thing has been dragging on for 9 months because of this fiddling, and the Securities Commission says that no harm has been done. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. You would no doubt be aware that last year, according to the Prime Minister, he asked his own departmental officials to look at whether the form of welcoming ceremonies was still relevant to contemporary Australia. Will you undertake to inform the Senate of the costs of establishing a permanent ceremonial honour guard; how many men and women would be seconded to this unit; and where their home base would be when not parading for Mr Keating and guests? Do you support Mr Keating's proposal? Can you inform the Senate whether Mr Keating has expressed any thoughts on the style of uniform he has in mind for his guard? Will gold braids, brass buttons, epaulets and plumes predominate, as befits the very model of a modern part-time Prime Minister?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this regards the Defence Force, it relies on me to put down that furphy and stupid question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Newman. The force structure review says that the major defence assets move north and west quite properly. That is absolutely no reflection on the honour guards we currently have. They are not in full-time training. The question the Prime Minister asked was: can we either improve that, or do we go to another form of ceremony to assist in greeting dignitaries who come to this country? So the defence department looked at all angles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the angles was to ask: should we do what other countries do in terms of having a professional honour guard?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This furphy has been taken off one newspaper article of today from a reporter who did not ring my office. I know why he did not ring my office&mdash;he would not have liked the response; he would not have liked this furphy, which fits the opposition conspiracy theories, to be deflated. He was told by the Prime Minister's office where this was all at. Again, he failed to properly put that in his article. This is a furphy. It simply came out of a view that the Prime Minister and I share that the honour guards that we turn out in Canberra are not of the same quality that we can turn out in Darwin, Townsville or many other military areas. One of the questions we were looking at is whether we should have them at all, or what are the alternatives. For Senator Alston to talk today about uniforms and all the other glib stuff is sarcastic nonsense.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note with interest the answer given by the minister that somehow Canberra is not quite up to the quality of other capital cities. The fact is that the Prime Minister said in a press statement today that he asked his officials to look at whether their form was still relevant to contemporary Australia&mdash;in other words, more cultural cringe. He wanted to know how we can upgrade so we can compete with the rest of the world in terms of pomp and ceremony and splendour? As I understand it from his press release, he said that your department advised that one option would be the formation of a permanent ceremonial guard unit, but this would be costly. Will the minister tell us what the cost was? How much effort was put in by all these officials in pandering to the whim of the Prime Minister?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate clearly to the Senate that the issue the Prime Minister raised was not whether honour guards should necessarily be upgraded or downgraded but whether they were the most appropriate way of welcoming visiting dignitaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These figures reflect what the Prime Minister has been saying: Australia has been enjoying 36 months of economic growth. We have the highest growth level of any economy in the OECD, and these figures reflect that. This is indicated in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which shows a survey of interim company profits for the six months to December 1994 carried out by the Australian Stock Exchange and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This survey of company profits and other recent indicators points to sustained economic growth for the future. It paints a very positive picture. Net profits for Australia's major listed companies in the six months to the end of December 1994 were 30 per cent higher than for the same period in 1993. This profit rise comes on top of three years of extraordinary growth in profits, where we had a trebling of earnings in the three years to 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister has often said, we have had 13 consecutive quarters of strong growth with very low inflation. There has not been such employment growth combined with low inflation and strong GDP growth over two years since 1965-66 to 1966-67. Australia is going through a period of very high growth historically. As the report says, this is proof of the strength of the recovery in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment in the September quarter 1994 national accounts was 22.2 per cent higher than for the year earlier. The latest ABS figures indicate that spending on private new capital expenditure in the first half of 1994-95 was 23 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. The expectations were for a substantial increase for the whole of 1994-95. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-Westpac survey of industrial trends for the March quarter 1995 released earlier this week shows that respondents remain very confident about investment prospects, with 40 per cent of respondents expecting to lift capital spending over the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other pointers to increased investment are reduced debt levels and higher rates of capacity utilisation. Sustained non-inflationary growth in the economy will occur only if investment is strong enough to prevent supply bottlenecks emerging. These latest profit figures and recent investment statistics indicate that capacity will not be constrained on future economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other leading indicators suggest that demand is moderating to more sustainable levels. The latest ACCI national survey of business confidence for the March quarter  indicates that economic growth is expected to continue over the course of this year but at a more sustainable rate than has been the case over the past 12 months. The survey also indicated that the investment recovery has maintained its momentum. Profits like those in this result come from the government's real economic policies for sustainable economic growth. You do not get sustained low inflation and half a million new jobs&mdash;as we have generated in the last two years&mdash;without good economic management.</PARA>

Let me say with respect to why they are still here that it goes very much to continuing discussions with the Chinese. Let me say also at the outset that those discussions have been both constructive and successful.

That is precisely what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My trip to China was initiated some two months ago and approval was given some time ago. Part of the trip to China is of course to discuss continuing relations between Chinese authorities and the Australian government with respect to not only the number of people we have here now and their return but also any another boat that might be attempting to leave China. Those discussions will be conducted in the same constructive spirit in which we have conducted discussions so far. That trip will canvass that issue as it will canvass quite a number of other bilateral issues. For me it is an important issue. It is one that I have focused on consistently for a number of months now in terms of not only making sure we had the apparatus right in this country to ensure ready return but also the constructive relationship with Chinese authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the legislation, it was important to have it on the books to ensure the process that we are undergoing now is a process that we could legally undergo. That is why that legislation was put into this place as a priority to ensure that we could continue to process these people and to make assessments with respect to them in accordance with law that would allow for speedy return if they were determined to be Sino-Vietnamese from the south of China. For that, Senator  Short, I thank you for your cooperation and I ask you to note that that cooperation has not been misspent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very fitting that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy chose this particular aspect of World War II as its contribution to the Australia Remembers commemoration. The 3,000-strong Australian Women's Land Army was created specifically to meet the demand for labour in rural industries, particularly those necessary to feed, clothe and equip our military personnel. It also maintained maximum supplies of food for the general population of Australia by filling the vacuum created after farmers and their employees heeded the call to join the armed services. This, of course, immediately created a huge vacuum in a vitally important war industry which was filled by, among others, the personnel of the Australian Women's Land Army. The display will help provide long overdue recognition for the invaluable role that the women members of this group provided to agriculture and, hence, to the war effort of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beginning of the war in the Pacific required a fundamental, immediate change to the way in which Australia grew and produced its fruit and vegetables. Prior to this period, market gardens provided all fresh fruit and vegetables. When Australia became the base for the Australian and allied services in the south-west Pacific, extensive expansion was necessary and the area under production had to be doubled almost overnight. Much of this expansion was due to the efforts of the Australian Women's Land Army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land army stabilised grape, wheat, maze, citrus, stone fruit and dairy production at pre-war levels, which was a significant achievement for 3,000 women. It increased the production of oats, raisins and currants, apples and vegetables and doubled the Australian production of potatoes and onions. The value of our poultry industry also increased under AWLA care. Thanks to the efforts of these women, a new product was added to the list of Australian agricultural output&mdash;flax&mdash;which was vitally important to the war effort, and there was also a rapid expansion of the canned food industry. The land army was also involved in the dehydration, the drying, of fruit and vegetables. This industry did not, in fact, even exist in Australia at the start of 1941 but, by 1944-45, dehydrators located close to the farms produced 20,502 tonnes of produce, which of course was all then exportable in its dried form for the provision of troops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land army's efforts were vital to the war effort and were accomplished under trying and arduous circumstances. Its legacy has endured through an expansion in rural industries and enormous structural changes over the years in response to market and other challenges.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This follows a period of instability that has gone on for some time now caused by efforts of extremists to undermine the government. It led to the resignation of the former Prime Minister, the murder of two prominent Burundian leaders on the Hutu and Tutsi side respectively earlier this month, and recent fighting between the two groups in the north-east of the country resulting in the outflow of some 24,000 refugees into Tanzania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the genocide died in Rwanda in April last year, the international community has been pursuing strategies at several levels to prevent a similar crisis in Burundi. The most important of these have been preventive diplomacy efforts undertaken by the UN Secretary-General, the Security Council and member states acting both individually and through regional organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Security Council fact-finding mission to Burundi from 10 to 13 February recommended that the Secretary-General establish an international commission of inquiry into the October 1993 coup attempt and the ensuing massacres and that the UN presence in Burundi be augmented to assist the government to improve the judicial system, civilian police training and the administration of provinces. I think I mentioned that in an answer here in February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most recently, a Security Council presidential statement of 9 March condemned those involved in undermining the power sharing arrangements outlined in the convention of government and endorsed most of the recommendations contained in that mission report to which I referred. The UN announced a few days ago, on 24 March, that the office of the special representative in Burundi would be expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, in the last few days, the Secretary-General and the Security Council have been considering the options for preventive deployment to Burundi. One suggestion has been to redeploy some of the troops of the UNAMIR mission in Rwanda, across the border to Burundi. Another possibility would be to deploy a new separate multinational force which would be under a national rather than a UN command to maximise the speed of the response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's or at least my initial reaction to these options is that, if the situation deteriorates further and the violence continues to escalate, any intervention by the international community is going to require a peace enforcement capability, with a mandate under chapter VII of the UN charter. UNAMIR in Rwanda does not have such a mandate. It has a chapter VI mandate; it has been resourced and equipped&mdash;that is to say&mdash;to undertake peacekeeping, not peace enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of UNAMIR within Rwanda are important in their own right and it is not clear that, as currently constituted, UNAMIR could meet those functions effectively as well as take on major new tasks in Burundi. Moreover, recent experience in Bosnia and Somalia has shown the difficulty of peace keepers assuming a supplementary peace enforcement role if they are not structured originally for that purpose. It would seem to be preferable if the deployment option is pursued accordingly for the Security Council to create a separate operation with its own mandate to use force as necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge for the international community here is to balance the need to act quickly with the need to have a workable concept of operations and an adequately resourced force. The UN has made a concerted effort to prevent conflict, as I have said, in the past 12 months, but the difficulty it faces in identifying a viable response to this current deterioration underlies obviously the need for it to develop a more permanent capacity to respond more rapidly and effectively to emerging crises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AUSAID, the new version of AIDAB, is monitoring the situation in Burundi very closely. Beyond that, there is nothing more I can positively contribute to this discussion, but it is obviously a situation we are all watching very carefully.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government, as has been said in this chamber many times, has concentrated on growing the Australian economy, on creating new jobs. The growth in the Australian economy is the highest of any economy in the OECD. Our job creation is now at half a million new jobs since the last election. Because the higher growth rates are now moderating to a more sustainable level and because inflation is low, job security levels must be higher as well. By decentralising, as we have, the wages system to the enterprise and having negotiations in the enterprise, the rewards of higher profitability&mdash;something I spoke of earlier in question time&mdash;can be better accessed by those workers who will help generate those levels of higher productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that setting of managing the economy so that it is sustainable and so that inflation does not ravage wages and undermine living standards that the issue of home mortgage rates arises. As a consequence of the Reserve Bank's decision to adjust the prime lending rate, most banks initially absorbed the change and did not pass it on to their mortgagees. There is now, due to the policies of this government, a higher degree of competition between banks. All this speaks to government policies directed to the needs of individual Australians, recognising the need to provide income, income security and access to the profitability of a burgeoning economy. That is what the purpose of the government has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the first part of Senator Harradine's question about superannuation funds, the government is addressing a major gap in the economy. Prior to the government requiring that there be payment of superannuation provisions for all employees, superannuation, as we inherited it from the conservative coalition, was only accessible by about 30 per cent of the work force. If you had a Public Service job or you were in a white collar occupation you got superannuation. The reform we have brought in is that all workers get superannuation and there is equity across-the-board. That is a significant Labor reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the debate is about providing superannuation as a retirement benefit or being able to access superannuation earlier and reduce the advantage of retirement benefits that superannuation would bring. The issues I have referred to, I notice, are attracting heckling from the opposition&mdash;heckling from the opposition for a very good political reason. Opposition members have spent their time running around this country decrying every positive economic indicator and acting as saboteurs of the economy, talking the economy down, trying to deter investment and undermining real progress because they believe that economic good news is political bad news for them. It is a political tactic which unfortunately has some damaging consequences for those who listen to them. I think that is the answer to Senator Harradine's question.</PARA>

Senator Watson refers to a draft ruling of the Taxation Commissioner, as I understand it, relating to particular drugs. I do not have any information before me about that draft ruling, but draft rulings are exactly what they say they are: draft and not final.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;further to the answer I gave to Senator O'Chee yesterday on the subject of tampon use and toxic shock, I advise the Senate that last night I made a public statement on the matter making clear my regret that I did not instruct  the sensitive post-mortem material to be excised from the detailed document made available to certain specialist journalists and I unreservedly apologised to the family of the girl in question for any further grief, anguish or distress the release of this information may have caused them. My statement read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to widespread public concern about tampon use and toxic shock syndrome&mdash;particularly following a 7.30 Report and newspaper stories in January about the death of a Queensland teenager last November&mdash;I sought a detailed report from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Department of Human Services and Health) on the standards and safety issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A nine-page report I received from the TGA addressed these issues in considerable detail, making it clear that much of the media reporting had caused quite unnecessary alarm, and that Australian standards in fact led the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Announcing the TGA conclusions on March 13, I released a three-page summary of the report to the media at large, and made available a copy of the full report to several specialist journalists who asked for it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the detailed nine-page report contained, in its background section, a two-paragraph precis of sensitive medical information derived from the post-mortem report on the Queensland teenager. While the name and address of the girl was not mentioned, her identity would have been obvious to any person who had been following the public debate. I deeply regret the detailed version of the report was released without this material being depleted.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the statement.</PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) for finally saying today what she should have said in answer to Senator O'Chee's perfectly reasonable question yesterday. On the minister's part, this has been a very tacky little exercise. Yesterday you were asked a very reasonable question that went to the privacy of a young girl who died, possibly from toxic shock or possibly from something else, and to the grief that the release of that personal information caused her family. You ducked and weaved and did everything you possibly could to avoid that but what you actually did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You actually sought to say that the question did not relate to the release of the sensitive information but related to the safety of tampons in Australia, which it did not. You sought to evade the real question by answering a question you invented that related to the safety of tampons. As I recall, you had the gall to imply, when senators on this side said that you were not answering the question, that we were not interested in the safety of those products when, in fact, we were interested in the safety of those products and also what you did in releasing this information. That can at very best be described as a tacky little exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, when asked a supplementary question you were dragged kicking and screaming to the truth of the matter&mdash;that is, that you did release this information. You sought to justify that by saying that that information was in a further detailed statement that some specialist journalists had requested as if in some way that exonerated your activity and entitled you to answer no to the first question when clearly it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we sought to take note of your answer you tabled your three-page press release in order to imply that that is what you had done. You later referred to this other information that you had given out. In your case, it has been a tragedy of errors of judgment. Your first error was to leave the information in the report in the first place. Your second error was not apologising to the parents and admitting your mistake as soon as Senator O'Chee quite reasonably raised the issue in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You compounded the error by making another error of judgment; that is, you tried to squirm out of your responsibility for your actions with these pathetic and deceitful claims that you made in your first answer yesterday. You made an error of judgment by not recognising your mistake and apologising for misleading the Senate in your first answer. There is nothing wrong with that. People misunderstand questions every now and then. They say, `I'm sorry. I've made a mistake. I thought you were asking me this; you were asking me that. I'll now give you the answer you want.' That was a further error of judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You still refused to apologise to the parents. You had three opportunities in this place yesterday to do that: in the first question, in the supplementary question and when taking note of your answers. On each of those occasions, you could not be dragged kicking and screaming to apologise to the family. It was then compounded because you tried to imply that Senator O'Chee had some other motive and he was just raising the subject of tampons in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You went further than that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program last night. I listened with care to what you had to say on that program, and I was pleased that you were prepared to apologise to the parents and at least say that you were sorry for the harm that had been caused. But I was somewhat surprised to hear you still try to squirm out of responsibility for what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You tried to deny responsibility in two ways. In the first instance, you said that not only were you entitled to release this information but you had a public duty to release it. No-one on this side denies the public duty of any minister to release information on health matters that the public needs. But you cannot hide under that duty or behind that shield and use that as a reason for releasing the personal information about this girl. Again, you were trying to say that you had some responsibility to do this callous thing that you did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that, when the journalists saw through that and said, `Surely the details of this girl's post-mortem don't add to the sum of public knowledge on it,' you replied, `The TGA&mdash;the Therapeutic Goods Administration&mdash;thought it was relevant,' as if to say, `Let's blame the TGA.' You were still saying, `Hands off. I had nothing to do with this. This was not me. Let's blame the TGA,' without mentioning that that material was put in a private report to you as background information, and without mentioning that it was you who chose to release that report, to all intents and purposes, to the public. Last night's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program was another opportunity&mdash;the fourth opportunity&mdash;for you to face up to your responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of your responsibilities was to apologise to the family. Thankfully, you had the brains on that program&mdash;probably after being pushed by your colleagues&mdash;to apologise to the family. But you still could not bring yourself to admit that you were wrong, that it was your responsibility and that you did it. That is in very stark contrast to your senior minister, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). That gives us some insight into why you are where you are and she is where she is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When presented with this problem, Dr Lawrence said that she was not aware of this detail, and I believe the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> says that. Dr Lawrence had not only the political sense&mdash;because we are not complaining about Senator Crowley's lack of political sense; although that is so overtly obvious it would be pointless to remark upon it&mdash;but also the sensitivity and responsibility to say, `I am the responsible minister. I take responsibility for what has been done, and I unreservedly apologise.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why couldn't you do that when you first answered Senator O'Chee's question yesterday? Why did we have to go through this dragging and screaming exercise to make you realise what you had done, admit it and accept responsibility for it? Why do you have such a manifest inability to do that? That is the point that we want to make. In stark contrast to your minister&mdash;who, as I have said, indicated that she was the responsible minister and would take responsibility and unreservedly apologise&mdash;the first thing you have done is say, `I didn't do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then you said, `I kept away from all this. I did not want to release all this information.' Then finally in answer to the supplementary question you said, `Yes, I did, but that was not what I was asked. It is all too confusing.' It was confusing for you maybe but apparently not for your senior minister and not for anybody else on this side and not, I might say, for any of your colleagues. Then you tried to dump it on to the TGA saying it was all their fault. Then you tried to claim you had some sort of responsibility to release this detailed information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you think there was anything in that detailed information that made you have a responsibility to pass it on, you could have phrased whatever that was. Perhaps you think the detailed information reveals the possibility of an alternative cause of death. Perhaps you think that. If you do, you could have said quite simply, `Medical evidence indicates there is a possible alternative cause of death. Women around Australia should not assume that this is a toxic shock syndrome case.' That is all you had to say. It does not take a lot of wit to take out personal information about the young girl and to make that statement. In fact, that would be a more effective way of indicating your concern to Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the last point vis-a-vis Australian women that I want to conclude. I indicated to Senator Evans that I would not go on at length. I do not think people need to highlight, by repeating, the level of incompetence you have displayed. I am prepared to leave that point there, but you have done Australian women no service at all. Your government, along with the opposition, believes that we need more women in parliament. You and I would say as we go to speak at functions in relation to women's groups that women can do it as well as men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You know there are fewer women in parliament and you know every time one of us makes a big bungle like you have it does nothing for the younger women trying to come up, because all your mates will say vis-a-vis the next woman who wants to be a minister, `Hope she's not like Crowley and makes all those bungles.' You know. It is unfair, I know. The boys bungle but because there are fewer of us you have a responsibility to bungle less&mdash;a responsibility you are manifestly incapable of living up to. When women get to positions such as yours, since you see yourself as some role model, it would be handy if you could bring yourself to discharge your responsibilities in such a way that Australian women can be proud of you rather than mumble behind their hands that they wish you had not muffed this up as comprehensively as you did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will ignore the feminist dimension of Senator Vanstone's contribution coming, as it did, from the foremost exponent of the opposition's gender envy squad over there. We are familiar with that particular part of the deal. I do not think you should do anything other than stick to the issues involved in this particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to those substantive issues as distinct from the cosmetic colour put on them by Senator Vanstone, let me say this: there is no reasonable case for saying that Senator Crowley in any way misled the Senate in her answer yesterday. She did not say anything at any stage that was factually false and that has not been made out by the opposition. It is perfectly true that it took her until she got a supplementary question to get the basic point that did seem to be being pursued by Senator O'Chee on the record, but she did get there. After all, that is the purpose of supplementary questions, to make sure ministers do get there in their answer. That is enough, I think, on the particular question of misleading the Senate. Saying that a minister has misled the Senate is a serious suggestion to make. There is no foundation for that in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other issue that was the centrepiece of Senator Vanstone's contribution, it does need to be understood that Senator Crowley's handling of this matter has been motivated from start to finish by deep and sincere concern for the public interest in this matter. In particular, she was anxious to convey a very clear message to the Australian community&mdash;in particular, Australia women&mdash;that there was no basic safety or standards problem so far as tampons in Australia are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She wanted to get on the public record as much detailed information as she possibly could in support of that conclusion. It is on that basis that she made available the much more detailed report of the Therapeutic Goods Administration which overwhelmingly went to these standard and safety issues rather than any individual cases. It is for that reason that she wanted to get that out on the record to those specialist journalists who were capable of writing about this issue in an informed way and who were keen to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points I know that was particularly worrying Senator Crowley throughout her consideration of this matter was her desire to communicate the reality that toxic shock syndrome had not been clearly established as the cause of the young Queensland teenager's death. </PARA>

To the extent that she focused on it, I think it is fair to say that she took the view that detailed medical information making clear that this was still an open question was not inappropriate to be made available to those journalists who could be expected to write about this in a sensitive and competent way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill, if you will allow me just to get a word in edgeways, I am about to acknowledge that I think Senator Vanstone probably made a fair point, as did Senator Newman by interjection just a moment ago, that that point probably could have been made&mdash;that the cause of death being toxic shock was not yet clearly established&mdash;in those kinds of terms without the need to go to the detailed medical information. Certainly there was a serious downside involved, as you balance these competing interests, in invasion of privacy and putting on the public record medical material that was manifestly of an intimate and sensitive kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley&mdash;upon opportunity for reflection on the matter and understanding the points that have been made, considering all the issues that are involved in this case and  considering again all the balances of competing interests that were involved&mdash;has come out with refreshing frankness and absolute honesty and put on the record an account of the situation as she confronted it and made absolutely clear that she would have preferred that the material had been excised. She regrets that that was not done, and she does apologise unreservedly to the family of the girl in question for any further distress or anguish that may have been caused as a result of the release of this information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all any minister could reasonably be expected to do under those circumstances. She has done it, and I think that should be an end to this particular matter. She has been motivated throughout, as she always is, because she is an excellent minister, by considerations of public interest. There is no question of personal particular aggrandisement. There is no question of trying to score any quick political tricks on this matter. She was motivated by the public interest, and she has acknowledged that this particular question might have been handled better in a different way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Crowley had been motivated, as Senator Gareth Evans has told us, throughout this whole incident by a concern for the public interest, then I find it hard to believe that she would have tried to avoid answering this question when it was put to her in parliament yesterday. I find it hard to reconcile the image that Senator Evans portrays of a minister concerned always for the public good with somebody yesterday who was involved in an unseemly exercise in trying to avoid answering a question about why she revealed detailed intimate medical details about a poor 13-year-old girl who had died in Mount Isa. If she was interested and motivated solely by the public good, then why did Senator Crowley not immediately apologise to the family of the girl in question?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see Senator Crowley providing her defence to Senator Cooney. I think Senator Cooney, before he hops to Senator Crowley's defence, ought to read the material that was contained in the further information that Senator Crowley released to journalists. I have got it. I have read it. It is sick. It is really disgusting. I just make the point to the Senate that I can only imagine how entirely upsetting the media coverage of this post mortem must have been for that girl's family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing for which I am grateful is that, unlike Senator Crowley, some of the journalists who received this information found it so disgusting and so upsetting that they refused to print it. But there were stories carried in newspapers in Mount Isa, Brisbane, Adelaide and elsewhere. I find that very hard to reconcile with Senator Crowley's assertion that this intimate information was only provided, according to her statement today, to specialist journalists. I am going to go through and find out every journalist who received a copy of that information and I am going to find out exactly how specialist those journalists are. If Senator Crowley released it to any other than very specialist journalists, I am going to be back here asking more questions about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to this girl's father this afternoon. I spoke to him this morning. I have spoken to him each day for a couple of days about this matter and he asked me to say in the Senate today that he wants Senator Crowley to have the decency to resign, to have the decency to accept that what she did totally breached any accepted standard of behaviour. He wants me&mdash;and I am happy to do so&mdash;to call on Senator Crowley right here and now to resign. The standard of conduct that she has shown is totally and utterly unacceptable. She is the Minister for Family Services, for heaven's sake! How can Senator Crowley continue as Minister for Family Services when this is the respect and the courtesy and the consideration that she gives to a grieving family? Senator Crowley has shown that she is totally insensitive to the feelings and privacy of this girl's family and totally and utterly incompetent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Crowley had been competent, this material would never have been released in the first place. If Senator Crowley had been competent, she would have recognised that there was nothing in this material which added anything to the issue of whether or not this girl died of toxic shock syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Gareth Evans, in his defence of Senator Crowley, has told the Senate that he believes Senator Crowley may have been motivated by a desire to show that there was an alternative explanation for the girl's death. In that case, I find it hard to understand why the three-page summary that Senator Crowley released on 13 March commenced with the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 November 1994, a 13-year-old Mount Isa student died while competing in a school swimming carnival. The cause of death recorded on the post mortem examination certificate dated 1 December 1994 is ventricular fibrillation due to or as a consequence of toxic shock syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA>If that was Senator Crowley's motivation, then I find no reason why that statement and that paragraph would have led to the three-page summary document that she released. Again, I reiterate that Senator Crowley's appalling conduct shows a total and utter absence of any standard of decency and I do not believe that Senator Crowley should remain as Minister for Family Services. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time that sliding over the truth has occurred. On 7 November last year, I asked Senator Crowley how much money the government had paid Professor Peter Baume at the school of community medicine since he left federal parliament. An answer of $13,000 was given on 10 February. I asked the supplementary question as to whether it also included other appointments. Through the estimates process, Senator Crowley said, `I was wrong last time. In fact, it was $488,000 plus air fares.' It was only because I picked it up. The difference between $13,000 and $488,000 was a mere slip of the tongue. </PARA>

I want to draw an analogy between what Senator Crowley has done in misleading this Senate and what was done by Mr McLachlan in the other chamber. He resigned on noting that he had not seen a certain envelope that had some supposedly secret information on it. He resigned on that principle. The minister clearly said one thing yesterday and today has said another, admittedly with a drawn-out apology. She is still trying to say that what she said was correct when it clearly was not. There are double standards in this matter, and the minister should be drawn to account for them. It is not sufficient to just apologise. There are double standards throughout this government as exemplified by this minister. She must be drawn to account for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this issue because, like my colleagues, I am very concerned about what happened. I do not believe that the explanation of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) is adequate to explain why she would have released a nine-page document even to, as she said, specialist journalists. I presume she means by that those who write on medical issues. If she does not mean that, Senator O'Chee is quite right in examining whether they are specialist journalists. Obviously, from what Senator O'Chee has said, some of those journalists expressed concern about the contents of the TGA report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the minister wanted to emphasise to the Australian community, and women in particular, that it was not necessarily the case that the tragic death of this young girl was attributed to toxic shock&mdash;that it was only suspected toxic shock and that there may have been an alternative explanation for her death&mdash;and wanted to back it up, there are a number of other ways that she could have done it. She could have sought assistance from some specialist gynaecologists or some other source or even from an independent extract. She could have asked the TGA to write yet another report which expunged the more sensitive and personal details from it to enable the journalists to then put the case that the death may have been due to some other reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley is very aware of my concerns about privacy, which I have expressed over and over again in this chamber, and of my constant questioning of bureaucrats about the need to maintain information in a way that does not release personal information about individuals. Here we have a minister who did not table the material here in the Senate; rather she gave the material to journalists. The family of this young girl found that offensive and they found that it invaded their daughter's privacy, in retrospect, and their privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, it really surprised me that you did not apologise on the spot yesterday. Minister Carmen Lawrence had the good sense and the good grace to apologise unreservedly, and she was not even responsible for it, apart from the fact that she is your senior minister. As Senator Vanstone said, you squirmed and wormed your way around. In fact, in your first answer to the question, you did not even indicate that you had given journalists a copy of the nine-page document. Senator Crowley indicated that she had given them a three-page document. The truth was squeezed out of her at the end of the answer to the supplementary question when she referred to that document, and that was the error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the minister was not like Mrs Kelly. Maybe she looked only at the front of the document. Maybe she did not look any further, like Mrs Kelly with her environment booklet who said, `Well, I only endorsed the front.' Minister, when you release information like that, you need to be very careful. It was clear to whom that information referred. It referred to that young girl, although it did not have her name in it. I would have expected you, especially as a medical practitioner, to have been much more careful about the way in which you used that information. I would have expected you to resort to other methods and other measures to ensure that Australian women were informed that there was an alternative explanation and not start a mad panic about toxic shock syndrome, which is what I presume you were trying to do, but you did it in a very clumsy, very insensitive and very thoughtless way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister compounded that insensitivity and thoughtlessness&mdash;she obviously does not want to listen to what I am saying because she is chatting to Senator Evans; obviously, this does not interest her&mdash;by failing to apologise in the Senate yesterday during question time. As Senator Vanstone said, she could have done it in her first answer to the question; she could have done it in the answer to the supplementary question; and she could have done it when members on this side were taking note of her answer. She had three chances. As Senator Abetz said, she had three opportunities. It was not until Carmen Lawrence crowed that she began to think that she had better do something about it. I believe she was dragooned into apologising, because I saw what was going on around here in the chamber last night. I think that is totally unacceptable behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Keating was demanding the resignation of our leader over the release of sensitive documents. That is just typical of Mr Keating. He has one standard for himself and his mates and another standard for the rest of Australia&mdash;in tax matters and everything else.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that, if Senator Crowley were to do the right thing, she would voluntarily stand down because she has shown great indiscretion, great insensitivity and great thoughtlessness.

But she would not apologise when she made that mistake. When it was pointed out to her that she had made a mistake, she did not have the grace or the wit&mdash;I am not sure which she needed; both&mdash;to apologise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are only two matters that I want to raise. The first is, bearing in mind that at least part of Senator Crowley's defence is that she supplied this material to specialist journalists in the public interest, I invite Senator Crowley to provide Senator Vanstone, before question time tomorrow, with a list of the specialist journalists to whom she provided that information, in order that we might also be able to make an assessment on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the other aspect I want to raise is not particularly directed to Senator Crowley but rather to the fact that this is yet another demonstration of the double standards of Prime Minister Keating. Picking up what Senator Herron introduced, in many ways there are parallels to the so-called McLachlan matter. I know Mr McLachlan resigned from the shadow ministry because he inadvertently mislead the House of Representatives. But he also was called upon by Prime Minister Keating, even while he was out of Australia, and by other ministers of this government who were in Australia, to resign because McLachlan, on their claim, by photocopying certain documents, had invaded the privacy of certain Aboriginal women. They said, `For the invasion of privacy alone, McLachlan must resign.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance there can be no doubt that there has been quite a shocking invasion of the privacy of this family, yet I have not heard anything from the Prime Minister in the form of a determination that Senator Crowley should stand down. This is the government that we heard last night talking about the way in which it stood up for privacy issues in condemning Senator Baume. But in this instance, of course, there is an alternative explanation that is satisfactory to the minister&mdash;and apparently it is because this invasion was deemed by the government to be in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hear the Prime Minister stand up and mount that defence. Otherwise, it must seem to anyone listening to this debate that in both instances there was invasion of privacy&mdash;on the Prime Minister's claim, Mr McLachlan invaded the privacy of certain Aboriginal women; and in this instance, Senator Crowley invaded the privacy of this family. If one standard applies to one, why shouldn't the same standard apply to the other? The Australian people are sick and tired of Mr Keating's double standards. They would like to see him provide an explanation for that obvious inconsistency. </PARA>

There is one other matter I wanted to raise arising out of a question that was put to me by Senator Parer at question time about the Prime Minister's participation in the ITB tourism fair in Berlin.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister flew directly from Hanover, where he had that morning opened the Australian exhibition, as I said, at CeBIT and had launched the Australia Abroad Council's Experience Australia 95 promotion at the Spaengle museum. The preceding day he had participated at the opening of the CeBIT fair itself in Hanover after flying from Bonn, where he had had discussions with President Herzog, Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Kinkel. He also had a formal meeting with the Premier of Lower Saxony, Mr Shroeder. So there was no question of the Prime Minister having any spare time before he actually arrived in Berlin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In preparing the program for the Prime Minister's visit to Germany, his office had made inquiries about his possible participation in the ITB in Berlin. But his department was advised by the Department of Tourism following consultation with the Australian Tourism Commission that because the ITB finished on the afternoon of his arrival, and exhibitors were starting to pack up, there was no point in the Prime Minister's attendance at that point.

<PARA> I wish to take note of the answer given to me earlier today by Senator Bolkus in response to a question of mine which related to the minister's decision yesterday that the RAAF base at Curtin near Derby is to be activated for the purposes of being a detention centre for unauthorised boat people and his announcement that 171 people will be moved from Darwin and Christmas Island to that centre as soon as the facilities are ready, which it appears from the minister's statement yesterday will be in a few weeks time. The centre is to be activated over the next few weeks, to quote the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to thank the minister for his clarifying answer to my supplementary question today. I asked him, amongst other things, whether he would confirm or deny reports that the PRC government was now requesting payment by the Australian government of $20,000 for each person returned to China; that is, the Sino-Vietnamese people who arrived in Australia by boat late last year and early this year and for whom agreement has been reached with the Chinese government for their return to China. I asked him whether he would confirm or deny reports that the PRC government was now requesting payment of $20,000 for each person who was so returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the minister for his answer clarifying that he was not aware of that. The report came to me from a source that I felt was of sufficient stature to warrant&mdash;in fact, require&mdash;me asking that question of the minister. I am glad that he has cleared that up, although I want to look in more detail at the fine print of his answer when that becomes available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister did not really answer the main thrust of my initial question which was to the effect that it appears that the arrangements that the government of Australia has reached with the government of China for the return of the Sino-Vietnamese boat people may have stalled. In January I was told that the return of the approximately 700 people would commence in March. That has not occurred, and it does not appear that it will start to occur for some time yet. I think the minister, in his answer today, made that clear. If it were to start in the very near future, of course there would be no need to activate the Curtin base as a detention centre because space would be freed in Port Hedland, which is now at full capacity because of the Sino-Vietnamese people being there. That full capacity is about 750 to 770 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the arrangements between the two governments have been stalled. Certainly, these matters take time, as does all the detail that is required to be implemented and the consequential movement of people occurring. The department and, I think, the minister were quite confident in January, when they were advising the coalition on this matter&mdash;as a result of their advice the coalition helped expedite the bill which is to allow the return of these people to China&mdash;that there was to be a March start for the repatriation. That has not happened. There are a lot of questions that the minister needs to answer with respect to this: why has the delay occurred? How long will the delay be? What action is being taken to expedite the matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also incumbent on the minister to tell the Australian taxpayer how much the delay is costing. The cost of maintaining the detention centre at Port Hedland last year, when all costs were taken into account, was over $50 million. The minister is now talking about activating a new centre with a start-up cost of half a million dollars and monthly running costs of half a million dollars. A large amount of money is involved in this. The minister has an obligation to this chamber and to the Australian people to set the record straight and give us the details of just what is happening in this very important matter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very extensive display mounted in conjunction with the seminar. That particular display must have cost a lot of money to put together. I wonder what audience it was really targeted at. Certainly, the normal visitors to Parliament House who walked through the Great Hall yesterday would have had the opportunity perhaps to see something that they never would in any of the 26 regional project areas that are going on in this particular better cities program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Macdonald has said, the costs must defy the results of the conference. I wonder whether any of the papers that were presented are now going to be prepared and presented and be subjected to critical analysis. From the way I read yesterday's program, there was no opportunity for the panellists to participate, to comment and to criticise. A couple of the participants who took a personal interest in this matter called at my office during the day and said that they would have been able to count on one hand the number of people participating who were from the private sector. A couple of those were major contractors who have obviously had major benefit out of the better cities program. When you have got five or less private sector participants in an $800 million program that affects Australia, it really does defy any understanding of what must be going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was so concerned about this matter yesterday that I spoke about it with the Secretary to the Department of Housing and Regional Development, Mr Podger. I had expressed my reservations, criticisms and concerns to an officer at the seminar. In turn, he had passed those comments on to Mr Podger. As a result of that, we had a very good and frank discussion yesterday. I conveyed to the secretary to the department my dismay and my disappointment that the parliament had been totally misused for a partisan presentation of such an important project. Mr Podger indicated to me that he had spoken to Mr Howe, who had indicated that, until such time as the opposition was going to give full bipartisan support or a partnership arrangement for better cities, we would be excluded from any involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst Senator Macdonald and I were offered by the department a comprehensive briefing on this program, I think we have now picked up most of the material either through our Senate estimates work or through what was on display yesterday. Nevertheless, I am sure we will pursue that. I invite Minister Howe to give Senator Macdonald and me a comprehensive briefing on it&mdash;perhaps on the day before the budget, when it might be opportune for us to be fully acquainted with what is going to happen to the better cities program in this year's budget and whether it is going to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I notice that Mr Howe is continuing with a number of important statements. He indicated last February that he would make a major statement on housing. The timetable for that slipped to March, and it has now slipped to April. I understand that it is now not going to be delivered until after the May budget. Obviously, nothing is going to surface in this year's budget about additional initiatives that are so important and necessary in the housing area or in the better cities area. I would say that the minister is being given a hard time in cabinet about these portfolio areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the government seems to think it wants to own the issue of infrastructure, urban issues and regional development throughout Australia really does point out that the Labor Party believes that it can run departments for its own advantage and not for the advantage of the electorate and the community. I am sure that any subsequent assessment of the better cities program is going to show that Mrs Kelly's whiteboard had nothing to match how the funds are being distributed through the better cities program and in other areas. I would hope that the departmental officers will not be conned by the particular emphasis and colouring that has been given to this by the minister&mdash;who, at the moment, is the Deputy Prime Minister; but I wonder for how much longer. </PARA>

He arrived in Berlin at 3.15 p.m. The tourism promotion, which is the largest that the Australian Tourist Commission operates in Europe in any year, was continuing all day that day until the following day, when the exhibitors packed up to take their displays away.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I normally would not have entered this debate; but in view of the outrageous remarks made by Senator Parer, I want to say that what he said indicates the opposition's inability to talk about policy. All those opposite want to do is to make personal attacks on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As I said in the debate yesterday, you remind me of my party in the 1950s; all we could talk about was personal abuse of Bob Menzies, and he kept winning elections. You made the same attacks on the Prime Minister before the last general election. You said he was out of touch. When it came to the crunch, the people voted for him rather than for you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the debate yesterday, I think a very useful example of qualitative research was done by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. One person summed it up by saying that love him or hate him, in the end you vote for him because you know he can get on with the job. This attack on the Prime Minister because he did not attend the tourism conference is outrageous. The opposition firstly attacked him for going overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CeBIT conference, as explained by Senator Evans, was one of the most successful trade fairs on high-technology and the biggest in the world. Australia was asked to be the main contributor to that fair and I understand that we had 170 exhibitors. Australia was asked to be the major focus of that extraordinary trade fair. The Prime Minister went overseas to open that fair, to attend the fair and to promote Australia. Though you would not have known from reading the papers in Australia, the fair and the Prime Minister's visit were extremely well received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not like hearing that when the Prime Minister is overseas meeting leaders such as Chancellor Kohl of Germany they actually have long meetings and discussions of interest. When Malcolm Fraser went overseas the President of the United States called him John Fraser. When Billy McMahon was overseas, the only recognition he got was when his wife wore a dress with a long slit up the side. When John Gorton went to America they called him Billy. Whenever your leaders went overseas they had such little impact that the presidents of the United States got their names wrong. When our Prime Minister goes overseas he has lengthy discussions of interest with senior leaders of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Parer comes from an export oriented industry, the coal industry, he should be endorsing the Prime Minister for making many trips overseas to promote an internationally competitive economy such as Australia's. All your party does when the Prime Minister goes overseas is bag him for being overseas and not dealing with Australian issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You then attack him for his remarks about people with mortgages. I think it is a very apt description when he says that people with mortgages have their noses to the grindstone. He understands that it is tough for young families to pay the mortgages on their houses. The Prime Minister understands that because he comes from, and always remains part of, an electorate that has sent him to this parliament with substantial majorities since 1969 when, at the age of 27, he had his own young family and was living in Bankstown. Guess who gave him the advice that when he became Treasurer he should shift to Canberra and live here permanently? It was the present Leader of the Opposition. John Howard said he should move from his electorate and live in Canberra. </PARA>

Every time you try your party is split, senators in this chamber vote against the majority view of the party, people abstain from voting, people get up criticising the policy and the National Party breaks away.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Cooney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in response to your Committee's report on the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 and the Family Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1994. In order to provide the Government's response to you expeditiously, I now provide an interim response to the first part of the Committee's report, which deals with the Family Law Reform Bill 1994. The Government's response to the second part of the report, which deals with the Family Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1994, will be provided to you in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the Committee's report, which is very supportive of the reforms to Part VII of the Family Law Act 1975. The reforms provide an entirely different approach to the relationship between parents and children of separated families by replacing the present anachronistic proprietorial concept of custody and access with the more enlightened concept of parental responsibilities for the care, welfare and development of children. This responsibility diminishes as the child becomes more mature and is able to accept greater responsibility for his or her decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also welcomes the Committee's support for the encouragement of the use of non-litigious dispute resolution mechanisms. The Government is committed to the extension of primary dispute resolution services of the highest quality and to ensuring that services are appropriate to both men and women. In relation to the concerns expressed to the Committee relating to professional standards and the confidentiality and secrecy provisions, the regulations will, as indicated in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill, require disclosure by the mediator about the mediator's skills and qualifications to conduct mediation. The regulations will also make provision for instances where mediation is contra-indicated, such as a power imbalance between the parties which cannot be redressed, for example in cases of family violence. In addition, the Family Services Council is undertaking wide consultation on the development of agreed standards for mediators practising in government approved community based mediation services, and will be advising me on appropriate standards to be applied to these services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I attach the Government's detailed response to each of the Committee's recommendations in relation to the Family Law Reform Bill 1994. I also advise that the Government will be moving a small number of amendments to the Bill in the Senate, to address matters of a minor policy, drafting and technical nature.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the provision now in the Bill which allows for the imprisonment of Registrars be deleted. (See proposed section 67P)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  The Government does not accept the recommendation. It notes however that the provision deals with the situation where a Registrar, or any other person who obtains the information because of its provision to the Registrar, discloses, intentionally or recklessly, to other than an authorised person information about the location of a child which has been obtained pursuant to an order of the court. In many cases, the child is living with a parent who has fled family violence, and information about the child's location has been disclosed to a Government department on the basis that it would be protected. Disclosure of the information may place that parent, the child, and others with whom they are living, at risk of harassment or violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Family Law Council has recommended the imposition of the penalty. In its report `Power of the Family Court to Require the Provision of Information for the Recovery of Children' (September 1992) the Council endorsed my Department's proposal that a penalty, in the order of $12,000 or 2 years imprisonment or both, be imposed for the unauthorised disclosure of information obtained under the equivalent provision at the time (paragraphs 4.41-4.42). The Council's report noted acceptance of the proposal by the Family Court of WA, the NSW Bar Association and the Privacy Commissioner. In its Letter of Advice on the Operation of the (UK) Children Act 1989 (10 March 1994) the Council recommended that amendments to the Act in relation to obtaining information should "provide for a penalty for unauthorised disclosure" (p.19).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with other legislation, the Government believes that intentional or reckless disclosure of such sensitive information is completely unacceptable and should be the subject of a penalty including the possibility of imprisonment. Arguably, the Registrar would already be in breach of s.70 of the Crimes Act 1914 were information unlawfully disclosed and thus liable to a penalty of 2 years imprisonment. There is, however, a view that the Registrar may be exercising quasijudicial powers and therefore any disclosure not fall within s.70. This provision puts the position of the Registrar beyond doubt and covers disclosure by other persons. Should an intentional or reckless disclosure occur, the Crimes Act allows for a fine to be imposed in lieu of imprisonment, and imprisonment is only likely to be ordered for a most serious and intentional disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the 21 days now provided for in the Bill as the period during which a person is prevented from appealing against the decision of a Magistrates Court to interfere with a contact order made by the Family Court be reduced to 3 days. (See proposed subsection 68T(5) and paragraphs 1.29 and ff.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  The Government does not accept this recommendation. The proposals in this division of Part VII of the Act were developed within the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to overcome the very real concerns being expressed by women that continued contact with a child of the relationship by a father who had engaged in family violence either against the mother and/or the children placed that mother and children in danger of further family violence. The proposals in this Bill, together with the complementary proposals in the State and Territory family violence legislation, are designed to provide a break in the chain of violence and enable a proper reconsideration by the Family Court of the desirability of continued contact between the perpetrator of the violence and the children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of the Committee's recommendation the States and Territories have been consulted on the suggestion of reducing from 21 days to 3 days the barrier for bringing proceedings in the Family Court on a change to contact with the child ordered in family violence proceedings. The States are opposed to any such reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the restriction on appeal applies only to a change to a contact order where the family violence order is an interim order. The change to the contact order only remains in force while the interim order is in force, or for a maximum of 21 days. The Committee's concern that the 21 day period would allow an unscrupulous parent having the residence of the child to effectively deny the other parent contact with the child for significant periods can be overcome by that contact parent challenging the interim family violence order in the court in which that interim order was granted. The barrier to appeal against the change to the contact order prevents there being 2 concurrent, urgent avenues of appeal against the interim family violence order and its attendant removal of contact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Family Court of Australia monitor parenting plans when filed in the Registry. The Court should make rules specifying the information required in the plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:  The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government notes that in the discussion that led to this recommendation the Committee referred to a capacity in the Family Court to scrutinise parenting plans lodged with it pursuant to s.63D.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major thrust of the reforms is to allow parents greater opportunity for deciding what arrangements will be made in respect of their children and/or encouraging greater usage of non litigious dispute resolution mechanisms in settling arrangements where agreement cannot be reached. Provision for court scrutiny of such arrangements would defeat that approach. The Government notes that the Family Law Act currently provides for child agreements, which are registered with the court without any scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also considers it undesirable to require that particular information be in the agreement. If parents wish only to formalise particular aspects of their arrangements in an agreement, with more fluid aspects of shared responsibility left unspecified, it would add unnecessary complexity and expense to require them to include prescribed information. As with intact families, parents should have the flexibility to make whatever arrangements assist them in carrying out their responsibilities to their children without interference unless intervention is necessary to protect the children. The Bill contains such measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the court be asked to enforce any such agreement at a later time it could at that time examine the terms of the agreement and ensure that those terms are in the best interests of the child before making any enforcement order. If the terms of the agreement are deficient the court has powers available to it to make orders that are necessary in the child's best interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subclause 63D(2) provides that the court may make Rules in relation to the registration of the agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends, subject to Recommendations 1,2,3, that the Family Law Reform Bill 1994, as introduced, be enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The Government welcomes this support for the enactment of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Additional Comment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Spindler in his additional report raised three areas which he considers merit further attention. In relation to the first, the Government considers that the appropriate balance between safeguarding the interests of children and assisting parents to reach agreements at low cost and without unnecessary intervention has been reached in relation to the scrutiny of consent orders and child agreements. In relation to the second, that of the balance to be achieved between family violence orders and contact orders, the Government considers that the agreement reached with the States and Territories will provide a significant improvement to the protection of families from family violence, whilst recognising the rights of children to continued contact with their parents, where this is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Spindler also expressed concern whether there were adequate safeguards for the provision of interpreters for court proceedings and, particularly, for mediation processes. The Government has funded the Family Court to provide interpreter services and the Court has policy guidelines on the use of interpreters which state that interpreters are available for all matters and that such services are free. The question of interpreter services outside the Court system will be considered in the context of developing a regime to apply to the approval of mediators.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nationals of certain countries listed at Part 3 of Schedule 9 to the Migration (1994) Regulations (Attachment A), are not required to hold a transit visa if transiting Australia for less than 8 hours provided they are en route to a third country and do not leave the airport transit lounge. Taiwan is not included in the list of countries at Part 3 of Schedule 9 to the Migration Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Historically, inclusion on the "concessionary list" of countries was governed by the following con siderations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Identification of certain countries as "low risk" ie, less likelihood of using the concession for easy access to overstay or work in Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the need to foster Australia's foreign relations and ease restrictions as a gesture of goodwill eg, our bilateral relations with South Africa</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. need to recognise Australia as a major transit point for tourists travelling within the South Pacific rim</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. frequency of certain nationals needing to transit Australia for a significant proportion of their travel destinations eg, Papua New Guinea nationals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current concessionary list of countries was approved by the Minister in 1990. Certain countries were added to the list at that time because the Minister considered that the consequences for the integrity of the visa system did not outweigh the concerns expressed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding potential harm to our relations particularly with the South Pacific and many nations in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taiwan was not included in the list at that time largely because of concerns about the misuse of Taiwanese passports, more specifically, the use of fraudulently altered passports by non-Taiwanese nationals bound for the US and, to a lesser extent, the problems of adequate bona-fides checking in the absence of a post in Taipei.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DIEA corporate strategy provides for higher levels of visitor facilitation to support the Government's push for internationalisation of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this strategy resources have been devoted to examining the methods, procedures and policies that affect visa issuance in all major visitor markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taiwan, as one of the fastest growing tourist markets for Australia, has already been pinpointed as a market requiring higher visa issuance facilitation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concern relating to the inability to conduct adequate checking of transit passengers has been reduced after the opening of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office which works in conjunction with our office in Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DIEA has been considering recommending inclusion of Taiwan in the concessionary list as;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Taiwan has recently implemented a new passport with upgraded security features&mdash;this will counter reservations which we have had about the integrity of the Taiwanese document.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Customs Service (Customs) has no objection in principle to the delegation's recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of Customs' overall access and equity obligations a review is being conducted of the methods by which information is made available to international travellers, particularly those of non-English speaking background.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Options being considered include the translation of the Travellers Statement (or Customs declaration) into a number of languages, including traditional Chinese characters. Other options are to make translations of the questions asked on the form available on international aircraft in a number of languages with the Travellers Statement itself remaining in the English language (and therefore able to be understood by Customs Officers).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs is aware of the increasing traffic from Taiwan and the need to use traditional Chinese characters for Taiwanese people. This will be a factor in deciding on the most effective way to ensure international travellers are made aware of Customs requirements when arriving in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer considers that an inquiry into the overseas operations of Australian banks is not warranted. The overseas activities of Australian banks are matters for the commercial judgement of individual banks. Decisions on whether to operate in particular Asian markets are taken by the bank's management in the context of the overall strategies for growth in the region and operating environment of Asian countries. Banks report on these activities to their shareholders in their Annual Reports. For these reasons, the Treasurer considers that such an inquiry would serve little purpose.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Price</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We refer to the report of the Committee's Inquiry into the Operation and Effectiveness of the Child Support Scheme which was tabled on 5 December 1994. The Government is pleased to note that the report acknowledges the success of the Child Support Scheme in improving the welfare of affected children and in changing community attitudes to the ongoing responsibilities of parents in separated families. The Government agrees that there is room for refining the Child Support Scheme, and thanks you for your contribution to improving its operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government remains committed to the principles of the Child Support Scheme and to improving the Scheme's operation. In developing a final response to the report the Government's primary concerns will be to ensure that the interests of the children affected by the Scheme are served and that the principles of the Scheme are upheld, particularly that parents share in the support of their children according to their capacity to pay. These were also two of the general principles that the Access to Justice Advisory Committee recommended should apply to child support as stated in its Report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to Justice: an Action Plan</EMPHASIS>, May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your report contains a large number of recommendations, many of which deal with sensitive issues and have budgetary implications. Accordingly, the Government will make a full response to your report at a later date, when all issues have been properly considered. Some recommendations have implications beyond the Child Support Scheme. We believe the Government should seek expert advice, both legal and technical, from bodies such as the Family Law Council and the Privacy Commissioner before making a final response to these recommendations. Your report is currently being considered to determine which recommendations are capable of early implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large number of your recommendations relate to the administration of the Scheme by the Child Support Agency (CSA). Over the last year the CSA has made substantial improvements in administration and a number of matters highlighted in your report are already well underway. They include improvements to staff training, to phone systems and correspondence, as well as the allocation of additional staff to tackle outstanding debt. The Child Support Registrar has moved quickly to address most of your remaining administrative recommendations. Attached is advice from the Registrar outlining action taken in response to a range of the recommendations in your report [Attachment A]. The Registrar has also made a commitment to introduce a Child Support Charter, and consultation with client groups has already begun on this exercise. The Government hopes to finalise the Child Support Charter in the second half of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has begun a detailed examination of the remaining recommendations of your report, including your suggested changes to the child support formula. These recommendations require careful consideration of complex equity and workforce incentive issues. They also require regard to the costs to be incurred by taxpayers if there is any redistribution of the costs of children to taxpayers through Social Security outlays. While that work has already begun, the Government does not expect to have formed a view on the best way to progress these issues until later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We expect that most of the remaining recommendations requiring Government decision will be addressed in time for a final response to your report to be tabled in the first half of 1996.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues&mdash;Matters for the Child Support Registrar</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Purpose</EMPHASIS>: To provide advice outlining action the Child Support Agency (the Agency) has taken or proposes to take in relation to those recommendations that are within the responsibility of the Child Support Registrar and do not require Government decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues (the Committee) tabled its report concerning the operation and effectiveness of the Child Support Scheme (the Scheme) on 5 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the recommendations relate to the administration of the Scheme. Fifty three of these are within my statutory responsibility and can be addressed by the Agency without budgetary, legislative or policy implications, or decisions by other agencies. The improvement agenda already underway within the Agency combined with action taken in response to these recommendations will lead to significant improvements in the management and administration of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining 110 recommendations will require careful consideration by the Government as they have budgetary, legislative or policy implications. Some of these recommendations concern the administration of the Scheme but, if adopted, would require additional resources or legislative changes. For example, there are recommendations relating to the process for review of decisions, the use of private collection agencies, system changes and community awareness campaigns which require further consultation before the Government can decide how best to respond to them. The Agency will continue to work closely with the Department of Social Security, the Attorney-General's Department and other interested parties to provide further advice on these remaining recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have attached detailed advice on the 53 recommendations requiring my attention and the action the Agency has taken or intends to take in respect of each one. You may wish to release my advice at the time the Government makes its response to the Committee's report. I support the majority of these recommendations and, where the Agency is departing from the recommendations, I have endeavoured to address the Committee's underlying concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In preparing this advice, the Agency has consulted with other agencies, client representatives and community organisations. In particular, I have consulted the Registrar's Advisory Panel and can report their general support for the approach the Agency has taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MAJOR ADMINISTRATION ISSUES ARISING FROM THE REPORT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report identifies a number of areas relating to the administration of the Scheme that are of particular concern. These include the management of the Agency, the level of service we provide our clients and the effectiveness of our enforcement activities. Since I was appointed Registrar, my focus has been to ensure the Agency has strategies in place to improve its performance in these areas. There are positive signs that the Agency is making the right decisions in responding to the challenges identified through the Committee's inquiry. For example, in terms of debt collection, during the current financial year the Agency has collected more than $30 million of the total debt outstanding at 1 July 1994. In addition to the attached advice, I would like to provide some general comments on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Managing the Agency</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am committed to making sure the potential benefits of locating the Agency within the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) are maximised. Over the last 12 months, I have significantly strengthened the senior leadership team of the Agency and ensured that the ATO provides greater corporate support for the Agency. Service agreements specifying the level of support required from other areas of the ATO are being put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is also preparing a business plan, in consultation with the Registrar's Advisory Panel, that will outline an improvement agenda that will carry the Agency through to the year 2000. Through this process the Agency will prioritise and provide firm timetables for the action identified in this advice. The business plan will incorporate the commitments I have made in this minute but go further to outline broader improvement strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A one year plan will be completed by May 1995 and a five year plan will be completed by July 1995. The plans will be available to the community through the Panel, thereby providing another avenue for accountability. These plans, of course, will be the subject of my annual report to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through this investment in the management of the Agency we are already providing much greater guidance and support to our Branch offices, with a particular emphasis on achieving greater consistency of policy and practices throughout all our operations. Nevertheless, one of the major challenges that lies ahead for the Agency is to consistently implement national policies and procedures. Consequently, I have asked the staff of the Agency to make this one of the very highest priorities across all areas of our administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency's relationship with its clients</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has improved its client focus by:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">establishing links with its clients through the Registrar's Advisory Panel and regional advisory groups and outreach activities</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">commencing research to better identify the information needs of clients and their level of satisfaction with services currently provided</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">undertaking a job and work design process to ensure that work practices are formed around the needs of clients</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">implementing a comprehensive training strategy focusing on improving technical skills and providing quality client service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency acknowledges that the way in which we deal with our clients remains a major challenge. The Agency's telephone service performance has dramatically improved and I believe the introduction of a national voice messaging service will enhance the level of service provided. However, the Agency's efforts to improve the quality of correspondence are yet to deliver their potential benefits. Furthermore, the Agency's client education strategy has had its successes but clearly needs to be better targeted to the needs of all our client groups, particularly people from non-English speaking backgrounds and non-custodial parents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the Committee's recommendations, such as the recommended code of staff conduct and client service standards will be progressed through a Child Support Charter. The Charter will go further by providing a consolidated statement of the rights and responsibilities of the Agency's clients. Extensive community input to the development of the Charter has been received following national newspaper advertising. A draft of the Charter is currently being developed and will be progressed through the Panel before being presented to you for Government approval in the second half of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Debt collection</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has put in place strategies which, combined with additional resources and the implementation of appropriate training programs, are expected to improve its debt collection performance. The ongoing increase in case numbers and the difficulty experienced by the Agency in collecting the full amount of many liabilities as they fall due, given the low income levels of many liable parents and the unwillingness of others to pay, means that managing the absolute level of debt will remain a major challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMPUTER SYSTEM SUPPORT FOR THE AGENCY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the issues identified by the Committee, there is another key area which has a significant impact on our ability to improve the administration of the Agency in the short term. Most if not all of our interactions with clients depend to some extent on the smooth operation of the Agency's computer system. Given the importance of the computer system, I would like to make the following comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has identified the need for consistency in the application, registration and collection process and pointed out the difficulty clients have in understanding the process. Similar concerns are raised in the context of the payment of child support. Processing delays also feature in the Committee's concerns about these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there is much the Agency can do to improve how it explains the collection and payment processes to clients, the Agency faces a major challenge in re-developing its computer system to ensure these processes meet the needs of the Agency's clients for accurate advice and timely action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The computer system that underpins these processes needs substantial redevelopment and enhancement in order to cope with the work volume that now exists, and to support the level of service that clients properly expect. Significant improvements have been made to the accounting system but much remains to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is currently developing an information technology improvement program, in tandem with our business planning process, to redevelop its computer system. This improvement program will identify improvements that can be made progressively over the next five years. This program is likely to have significant resource implications that will require Government consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WHERE TO FROM HERE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My staff have taken a keen interest in the Committee's report and, through their input into this advice, have expressed a commitment to improving our relationship with our clients. A major priority for the management of the Agency will be to ensure that staff have the training and other support they need to successfully implement the improvement agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Registrar's Advisory Panel have accepted my invitation to work closely with the Agency in the development of the Child Support Charter, our business plan, and in monitoring our progress in implementing our improvement agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is well advanced in meeting the administrative challenges it faces. However, as the Committee acknowledged, the Agency deals with people at one of the most sensitive and traumatic points of their lives, that is, immediately following family breakdown. There will always be inherent tensions in the Scheme that make it difficult to meet the expectations of all our clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that the Agency's improvement agenda and the action outlined in the attached advice relating to the Committee's recommendations will go a long way to ensuring that the Agency collects a greater amount of the child support owing whilst taking account of the needs of all its clients.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">March 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency establishes, as a matter of priority, national policies and develops the necessary guidelines and manuals to ensure uniform practices are observed in all areas of Child Support Agency administration and in accordance with the child support legislation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports this recommendation and had, prior to the report being tabled, set up a number of mechanisms to develop and implement consistent policies and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency recognises that it must be consistent and fair in its dealings with all clients if it is to administer the Scheme in an effective and equitable manner. The Agency's Policy Development Unit was established in January 1993 to tackle this issue. This Unit promotes consistency in understanding and application of national policies and procedures by issuing discussion papers, policy guidelines, Child Support Determinations and Child Support Rulings. Matters requiring policy development are identified and prioritised by conducting regular surveys of Agency staff and external stakeholders. The process for developing policy documents is a consultative one involving the same internal and external stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is monitoring the implementation of national policies and procedures to ensure they are applied consistently. To support this process, the Agency has established regional structures to identify inconsistencies in practices. A Deputy Registrar in each region has responsibility for child support matters in his or her region. A regional executive forum consisting of the regional Deputy Registrar, branch office directors and a staff association representative meets regularly. One of their responsibilities is to ensure that policies and procedures are applied consistently in the region and to take remedial action where this is not happening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency also holds national conferences involving all branch office directors. One role of these conferences is to contribute to consistency of practice and procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All staff now participate in a legislative training program which is conducted co-operatively across each region to improve consistency in understanding and applying the legislation. This also promotes consistency in procedures across the Branches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One factor critical in promoting consistency is the level of staff access to policy and procedural information. To improve the level of support provided to staff, the Agency is currently examining the possibility of using electronic document folders to provide staff with easy and consistent access to Agency policies and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that child support debts due under default assessments be included in the calculation of the Child Support Agency's collection rate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has included debts due under default assessments in the calculation of its collection rate since 1 July 1994. No further action is required in relation to this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 9</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that child support debts paid pursuant to private collection cases registered with the Child Support Agency be excluded from the calculation of the Child Support Agency's collection rate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has never included these debts in calculating its collection rate. No further action is required in relation to this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 10</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency establishes a nationally co-ordinated approach to identify, assess and introduce as revised national practice, administrative improvements from local branch office initiatives and from best practice in the public and private sector</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports this recommendation and has already acted to implement it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has established a Business Improvement Unit to coordinate the Agency's approach to developing best practices for national implementation. As part of an ongoing program, all branch offices of the Agency were asked in December 1994 to share improvement initiatives/best practices by providing details to the Business Improvement Unit. That unit will disseminate information about these best practices to other branch offices. Initially, branch office directors will be regularly contacted to identify best practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improvement initiatives will be assessed as part of a process of continuous improvement within the Agency and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) as a whole. The outcome of this process will be the development of national best practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to public/private sector best practices, the Agency has embarked on a long term, systematic and integrated process of continuous performance improvement consistent with a general move within the ATO. Input to the Agency's continuous improvement process has come from experienced practitioners in the ATO, the ATO Continuous Improvement Team, and from leading organisations in both the public and private sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees are often the best source of suggestions for positive change. They are in the best position to know what is going wrong and frequently know how to improve the work system. Through a national health and productivity program, staff are encouraged to identify workplace barriers to administrative efficiency and effective service to clients. An action plan is then implemented to resolve identified issues at national, regional and local levels. The program embodies continuous improvement and Industrial Democracy principles and promotes staff health and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this national approach, a regional Deputy Registrar has been appointed in each administrative region to work with the branch office directors in these regions to identify best practices regionally. These best practices are then presented to the CSA Executive and consideration is given to national implementation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has acted to implement parts of this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency's National Training Unit is responsible for identifying training needs, setting priorities, developing appropriate training strategies and coordinating the development and presentation of training. This Unit has undertaken an extensive planning process to identify immediate training needs and priorities and, as a result, is concentrating on training in the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Technical training&mdash;the CSA Tech 1-2-3 program is a comprehensive program covering all aspects of the child support legislation and related legislation. CSA Tech 1-2-3 is aimed to ensure the provision of accurate and consistent technical advice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Client service training (incorporating the Client Contact Skills program)&mdash;all Agency training should focus on being sensitive to clients' needs and staff will have access to training and resources capable of providing the interpersonal skills to confidently impart technical advice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Arrears and compliance training&mdash;is focused on constructive client contact through improved understanding of the law. This will enable a consistent approach to assessments and provides technical skills for debt collection. This training will be incorporated into CSA Tech 1-2-3.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (a)&mdash;ensure that training has an appropriate focus on client service</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency's National Training Strategy, released on 15 August 1994, contains the following statement in relation to the client service focus in all areas of training:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Agency National Training will initially focus on front-line staff, to achieve the earliest and best responsiveness to client needs. Front-line staff have the most direct contact with our community. Their performance strongly influences the quality of service delivered. Staff interactions with clients should leave a lasting perception of ease and competence with which the Agency can act on their behalf and resolve their difficulties.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle in this statement is built into the design of all training products produced and cleared by the National Training Unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Client Contact Skills program is a specific program aimed at improving the client contact skills of Agency staff. The pilot of the program was completed in February 1995 and all Agency staff who have direct contact with clients will undertake the program by 31 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (b)&mdash;evaluate the effectiveness of the training provided by measuring the transference of skills learnt by staff into the workplace</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effectiveness of all national training is tested before national implementation. The National Training Unit also provides support to branch offices to allow for evaluation of training provided locally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effectiveness of all national training in transferring skills into the workplace will be evaluated. For example, the effectiveness of the CSA Tech 1-2-3 program will be evaluated in three phases</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">participant knowledge will be assessed at the end of each module</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an evaluation of Trainer Training and the design principles will take place when all modules are released</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (c)&mdash;introduce a national program for validating and accrediting all training material and training received by staff of the Agency</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All national training programs are piloted and tested before being formally introduced. This allows the Agency to detect any deficiencies in the package and make sure that the best possible product is ultimately presented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Agency staff are also employed by the ATO, they have the opportunity to participate in the Taxation Officer Development (TOD) program. Steps have been taken to integrate child support specific topics into the TOD program. For example, Agency staff who complete certain CSA training courses can gain credit towards completion of the TOD program. The TOD program has been formally accredited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (d)&mdash;adopt progressive and innovative approaches to training and abandon the Agency's reliance upon "in house" and "on the job" training</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency's training strategy recognises that it is necessary to have a mixture of in-house and external resources. The Agency does not rely exclusively on in-house training but will use its own expertise where appropriate. It is important to use the best source of information, knowledge and skills in developing training materials. The Agency will strive to use the best available resource wherever that may be located.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in developing materials specifically dealing with child support legislation or procedures, the Agency is confident that the most appropriate source of information is available internally. However, if the required knowledge or skills are not available within the organisation, the Agency will engage external consultants. For example, a consultant was engaged to develop the Client Contact Skills package which is currently being piloted. The Agency may also choose to use subject matter experts from other areas of the ATO where they can provide the best available resource.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has also developed source materials which can be used in a variety of ways. This allows for the same material to be used for self-paced learning, in workshops involving small groups of people or in more formal classroom training sessions depending upon the needs of particular staff members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the job training can be a valuable way of reinforcing knowledge and skills first learnt in more formal training. In some cases, on the job training is the most effective way in which a particular training need can be met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (e)&mdash;recruit more staff with experience and qualifications in client service oriented disciplines to assist in changing the current predominantly tax and finance oriented staff culture</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has, as part of an industrial agreement under enterprise bargaining, undergone a Blueprint process, in which it has examined its current branch office structures to standardise those structures and work practices. Following on from this process, the Agency is currently working on an extensive work and job design process. All jobs in the Agency will be examined to define the duties to be performed and a general description of the job. In that process, the Agency is looking at the skills required as well as the skills that can be developed by working in the Agency. There will be an enhanced emphasis on client contact skills. This will allow the Agency to attract people with these skills, or who have the potential to develop those skills, to work in the Agency. The criteria used for selection for positions within the Agency will then be redeveloped around these duty statements and job descriptions. This will ensure an appropriate emphasis on client service skills in selection processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is committed to recruiting staff with the skills identified through the Blueprint process. As a major part of the Agency's work involves debt collection, it is important to have staff with an appropriate mix of client service and debt collection skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 13</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency introduces dedicated case officers, with assigned responsibility and accountability for individual clients</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is moving towards client based multi-function teams each with their own identifiable group of clients, with a combined team client ownership and individual case management approach. The Agency does not intend to introduce dedicated case officers with assigned responsibility and accountability for the bulk of its individual clients as this would not be an efficient use of its limited resources. Members of the Registrar's Advisory Panel and regional advisory groups recognised this and supported the Agency's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Blueprint process, the Agency considered a number of models for case management and came to the following conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Case ownership will provide clients with better service and will improve compliance only if targeted correctly and supported by an appropriate infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.This arrangement should be team based with provision for client ownership to rest with individual staff within each team for specific and current issue management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The introduction of individual case ownership should be seen as an enhancement rather than a solution. It should be a longer term goal for consideration after more systemic issues have been addressed and a period of consolidation has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed approach will provide responsive and robust client service where all members of the team are available to attend to their clients' needs as they arise. The service will not be dependant on the availability of an individual case officer. The team will have a richer pool of knowledge and experience with greater capacity to deal with a range of issues than one individual may have, and the capacity for individual case management is available as problems or issues arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the needs of individual clients can be diverse, each multi-function team will be able to provide most of the services their clients require from within the team. The remainder will be undertaken within a specialist team whose functions need to be performed separately for reasons of specialisation and accountability. The Agency has recognised the need to address issues of quality service and clear lines of responsibility and accountability. These issues have been given high priority throughout the Blueprint process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A team based approach also offers the Agency the flexibility to adjust staffing arrangements as the need arises without significantly disrupting client/staff relationships, as would be the case with individual client ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The team based approach to case management will be developed further and implemented consistently in all branches during 1995 through a process of work and job design.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 14</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency introduces a reference number system to ensure accountability for the advice given to clients and to enable follow up on commitments and the provision of feedback to clients</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency agrees that it needs to ensure that its staff are accountable for advice given to clients. The Agency believes that this recommendation would not be necessary if the current procedures for recording advice and commitments are followed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has an internal system for recording details of advice and commitments given to clients by telephone, in person or in writing. Under the ATO's Agency Agreement, Agency staff have agreed to identify themselves to clients. These two measures will ensure that staff are accountable for advice and commitments they give. The Agency acknowledges that advice and commitments are not always properly recorded. In light of the concerns raised by the Committee, the Agency undertakes to improve the consistency of recording advice and commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This commitment will be supported by the Client Contact Skills program, the Child Support Charter and the move towards team based case management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 16</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency, as a matter of urgency, develops national guidelines for the identification and administration of cases where there is a history or risk of domestic violence and/or child abuse</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports this recommendation and has commenced work on these guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency's Policy Development Unit is preparing guidelines for the administration of cases involving domestic violence or child abuse. The Agency is consulting a wide range of external stakeholders including client representatives, community groups, legal services and other agencies such as the Department of Social Security, the Attorney-General's Department and the Privacy Commissioner in preparing these guidelines. A draft guideline is expected by 30 April, with a final guideline in place by 31 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 18</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that within 6 months of the tabling of the Joint Committee's report, the Child Support Agency conducts a study of the information needs of its clients and identifies shortfalls in current representation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency agrees that the identification of its clients' information needs is a priority. In order to be able to identify these needs, the Agency will need a specifically designed process to explore the most effective way of providing information to a diverse client population. In preparation, the Agency has started collecting and analysing data from a number of sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1995, the Agency commenced a client survey aimed at establishing the level of satisfaction with services currently provided by the Agency. An integral part of this survey is the establishment of some base data for age, education levels, ethnicity and socio economic backgrounds of the Agency's clients. Information is also being drawn from the Agency's Client Relations Officers in each branch through their work with diverse client groups and a range of community organisations. A client profiling project, which is currently underway, will provide information on sources of income of clients. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conjunction with the above research, the Agency will also commence a research project looking at the specific information needs of some of the key client groups. Research undertaken to date has indicated that specific client groups have a poor understanding of their rights and obligations. Advice from the external advisory panels has also supported this view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a first step in this research program, the Agency will be looking at the information needs of clients from non-English speaking backgrounds and the non custodial parent groups. Part of this research program will include research undertaken in the 1994-95 year on current and potential clients from non-English speaking backgrounds or who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 19</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that within 12 months of the tabling of the Joint Committee's report, the Child Support Agency reports to the Assistant Treasurer on the costs and benefits, including savings to community organisations, of introducing an advisory function to meet the information needs of its clients. This is to include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)a nationally co-ordinated `outreach' program targeted to the information needs of Child Support Agency clients, especially those clients in remote locations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)making greater use of the Australian Taxation Office's regional office network by establishing full time Child Support Agency advisory staff in these offices; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)making advisory staff available on a short term, permanent or rostered basis in remote locations in community legal aid, the Department of Social Security or other offices</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports paragraph (a) of this recommendation and has begun to implement it. There are some difficulties with implementing paragraph (b) as recommended and the Agency plans to consider these difficulties. Recommendation 19(c) requires further consultation with the Department of Social Security and other relevant government and non-government agencies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (a)&mdash;a nationally coordinated "outreach" program targeted to the information needs of Agency clients, especially those clients in remote locations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Client Relations Officer has been appointed in each branch office. These officers are working under national direction to develop and conduct a nationally coordinated outreach program targeted to the information needs of Agency clients through community based organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local outreach programs are currently being implemented by branch offices. These programs focus on general information about the Agency which the broader community may need and frequently takes the form of public information sessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some branches of the Agency have very recently set up local arrangements with community organisations in their area. For example:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Dandenong branch has been working with the Springvale Legal Service/Springvale Community Aid and Advice Bureau</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Brisbane branch has, in conjunction with staff placements in the Toowoomba regional office of the ATO, been working with community and professional groups in the Toowoomba region</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Pulteney branch has begun investigating the possibility of working with community groups around the cities of the Spencer Gulf</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Northbridge branch has commenced liaison with the Aboriginal Legal Services of Western Australia and associated community groups to identify specific needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients in Western Australia, in particular those in remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency will be evaluating these initiatives as they develop within the national program. This evaluation will start in June 1996. As these initiatives are new it is necessary for a reasonable period to elapse to enable an effective evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (b)&mdash;making greater use of the Australian Taxation Office's regional office network by establishing full time Agency advisory staff in these offices</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there is an identified need, a number of branches have been sending staff to regional offices in their areas. The experience in these offices will be evaluated in 1995 to assess the extent to which a nationally coordinated approach to using ATO regional offices is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some concerns about placing full time Agency staff within the Australian Taxation Office's regional office network. Some concerns relate to security, as staff in remote locations would be isolated and identified within that community as Agency staff, at potential personal risk. The Agency believes that the objective of providing a more accessible client service in remote locations can be achieved through the wider use of well planned and well publicised short term and rostered staff placements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (c)&mdash;making advisory staff available on a short term, permanent or rostered basis in remote locations in community legal aid, the Department of Social Security or other offices</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency will need to consult further with the Department of Social Security (DSS) and other relevant agencies before providing advice on this recommendation. The Agency will also have to consider in which offices other than the DSS it would be appropriate to place Agency staff and the practicalities of those placements. For example, the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia has advised the Agency that it may be appropriate to involve Migrant Resource Centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 20</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency develops in consultation with its clients, a code of conduct and service standards for Child Support Agency staff and ensures all Child Support Agency clients are aware of the standards of conduct and service which have been set</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency develops administrative mechanisms to monitor client complaints and solve the deficiencies in conduct and service delivery</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports recommendations 20, 21 and 22 and has begun to implement them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 5 December 1994, the Child Support Registrar announced his commitment to the development of a Child Support Charter. The Child Support Charter will incorporate standards of conduct and service and will set out the rights and responsibilities of the Agency's clients. The Agency, as part of the ATO, is bound by the ATO's Agency Agreement. That Agreement establishes a number of client contact principles which will also be embodied in the Child Support Charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Support Charter will clearly set out the standards of service to which the Agency's clients are entitled and explain rights of redress where those standards are not met. To complement the Child Support Charter, the Agency will put in place an appropriate problem resolution mechanism. Principles embodied in the Child Support Charter will be included in training material and policy documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Child Support Charter is being developed with wide community consultation. Submissions have been sought externally through all major national and regional newspapers as well as through the members of the Agency's Advisory Panels. Agency and other ATO staff have also been encouraged to have input into the development of the Child Support Charter. A draft Child Support Charter will be developed using this input through a workshop process and will then be refined further with additional consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency expects the final draft of the Child Support Charter to be presented to Government for approval early in the 1995/96 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency expects that delivery of the Client Contact Skills program to all staff will reduce the number of complaints about service conduct and delivery, and the Child Support Charter will provide clients with an enhanced understanding of their rights and responsibilities in their relationship with the Agency.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency develops communication strategies, targeted at the various groups of Child Support Agency clients, to inform them of their rights and obligations under child support legislation and Child Support Agency administrative practices which may materially affect each group of clients</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure Agency clients are aware of their rights and responsibilities the Agency will commence a client education program targeted to meet the specific needs of all Agency clients.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the report recognises the work already done by the Agency to educate potential clients through a number of programs, recommendation 24 focuses on the provision of child support information to people entering new relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency will explore a range of options for developing a resource package for use in relationship programs (including premarriage and counselling programs). The Agency will also discuss these options with a range of interested groups including the Australian Association for Marriage Education and the Catholic Society for Marriage Education.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that an independent consultant be engaged to work with the Child Support Agency to realign management and service to the needs of clients and develop strategies aimed at achieving best practice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has already taken action to realign management and service to the needs of clients by opening up its administration to greater community involvement and developing management approaches and work practices designed to meet client needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To increase community involvement, the Registrar established the Registrar's Advisory Panel and regional advisory panels. These panels consist of representatives of a range of client groups, other government agencies and community organisations. Their purpose is to provide advice to the Registrar and the regional Deputy Registrars on the administration of the Scheme and to consider proposals to improve that administration. This process assists the Agency to develop practices that meet the needs of its clients and address issues of concern to the community. These groups are involved in the Agency's business planning process and the development of the Child Support Charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is currently undertaking a job and work design process to ensure that work practices are aligned with the needs of clients. This includes the introduction of client based teams as discussed at recommendation 13.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has put in place substantial mechanisms to deal with the change and improvement programs currently in progress as well as to manage day to day administration issues. These are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a new senior management team consisting of a Second Commissioner with responsibility for child support and two Assistant Commissioners</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports this recommendation and has already acted to improve its telephone performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency conducted a national Telephone Project in early 1994 which, as part of its activities, investigated how other organisations managed their telephone enquiry workload. This investigation included the Department of Social Security and research findings from the Incoming Calls Management Institute in Maryland USA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has achieved significant improvements in its performance in this area. In May 1994, the Agency decided, as a short term measure, to allocate 10% of all staff to telephone enquiry work in each branch in recognition of the need to provide better service to clients. Since then, the Agency has improved its telephone technology and has made better use of the management information systems which accompany that technology.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General information about the Scheme will also be available to those clients who require it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSA Info Service will not replace the Agency's general enquiry service.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency acknowledges the Committee's concerns. The Agency treats its clients' privacy seriously and has already taken steps to prevent such breaches recurring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency issued a guideline to all staff in March 1994 dealing with Proof of Identity, Privacy and Secrecy. This guideline outlines the application of the secrecy provisions in the child support legislation, the Information Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 and establishes a procedure which staff must follow in establishing the identity of a person making an enquiry. It also describes what a client needs to do to authorise someone to act on his or her behalf so that the Agency is satisfied that a person making an enquiry does, in fact, have the authority to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 and its implications for collecting, storing, using and disclosing information are covered in detail in the CSA Tech 1-2-3 training program which is currently being implemented (see recommendation 11).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency revises its training programs in order to improve the ability of staff to interpret correctly court orders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports these two recommendations and has already taken some action to address them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency acknowledges that some of the problems relating to interpretation and implementation of court orders arise due to a lack of understanding by Agency staff as to the effect of particular clauses in court orders. However, problems also arise from ambiguous or ineffective orders being made by the courts and sought by legal practitioners. The Agency is currently working with the legal profession to improve the quality of court orders by developing model orders and disseminating these with supporting information through professional associations. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency issued a discussion paper in October 1994 dealing with interpretation of court orders. The paper refers to the difficulties encountered by staff in the interpretation of court orders which contain terms and expressions capable of subjective interpretation and provides a guide to interpretation of some of the most frequent areas of difficulty. The aims of the discussion paper are to improve consistency of interpretation across branches and to assist in the correct registration of court orders and court registered agreements. In response to comments received on the discussion paper, the Agency will develop a ruling aimed at achieving consistency of interpretation of those types of clauses. The Agency will issue a draft of this ruling by July 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 42</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that the Child Support Agency complies with the statutory requirements of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and allows prospective liable parents the statutory time to exercise their rights under the Acts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency already complies with these requirements. The recommendation appears to be based on the Committee's misunderstanding of the Agency's current practices. The Agency's current administrative practice is consistent with the statutory requirements of the Acts which allow the Agency to collect an assessed liability whether or not an application has been made under section 107.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned that a person who is notified of the Registrar's decision to accept an application for administrative assessment is not given the correct amount of time to appeal against that decision. The Committee's concern stems from the fact that the Agency issues a letter to prospective liable parents before making a decision on an assessment application (referred to as a "pre-acceptance letter"). The purpose of this letter is to inform the person named as liable parent that the application has been received and to explain what action the Agency will be taking to process it. The letter also contains a schedule indicating the amount of child support which may be payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This pre-acceptance letter is issued as part of the general process of administering the Scheme and not because there is a legislative requirement to do so. The letter is sent as a client service and its use has been supported by the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once an application is formally accepted, the Registrar issues a notice under section 34 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 advising the liable parent of that decision. The liable parent can apply for a declaration under section 107 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 that the application should not have been accepted. The time limit for applying for such a declaration starts to run from service of the notice under section 34. It does not run from the time the pre-acceptance letter is sent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee stated that, because the notice under section 34 is not issued until, on average, 19 days after the pre-acceptance letter, the liable parent has lost over half of the time in which a declaration can be sought. For the reasons explained above, this is incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 107(2) of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 states that an application to the court to dispute the Registrar's decision to accept or reject an application for assessment must be made within the time prescribed by the Rules of Court or within such further time as is allowed. The Family Court Rules (Rule 10&mdash;Application for Declaration under subsection 106(1) or 107(1) of the Assessment Act) states that an application shall be filed not later than one month after the receipt by the applicant of the notice given under section 33 or 34 of the Act, or within such further time as the court allows. It is up to the court to determine whether or not an application under one of these sections has been made within the prescribed time limit. The Agency has no part in making this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 109 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 states that the fact that a proceeding is pending under section 107 does not interfere with or affect any administrative assessment, and that any such assessment may be registered and amounts recovered as if no proceeding were pending.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency agrees that it needs to help clients develop a better understanding of what their future dealings with the Agency may be.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends that section 76 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 be amended to give statutory force to Child Support Agency practice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency does not support this recommendation as it would limit rather than reinforce the ability to make additional disbursements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognised that, under section 76 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the Registrar is required to disburse money to the custodian by the first Wednesday of the month following collection. The Agency's practice is to make two disbursements each month&mdash;on the first and third Wednesday. The Committee approved of this practice but wanted to ensure that the Agency has the legislative authority to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendation that section 76 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 be amended is not necessary. Section 76 stipulates the final date by which the Registrar must disburse money to the custodian. It does not prevent additional disbursements being made before that date.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency supports this recommendation and has already acted to implement it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted by the Committee, the Agency implemented a new accounting system in July 1994. The new system provides simpler statements each month to liable parents which show an opening balance, record payments and other changes to the account since the date of the opening balance and a closing balance which represents the new amount outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accounting system automatically assigns payments received from an employer deducting for only one employee to the liable parent's account. This will ensure payments are promptly and accurately recorded in those cases. The Agency is currently reviewing its procedures for reconciling amounts remitted by employers against liable parents' accounts to ensure amounts are recorded accurately in all cases. This review will be completed by the end of June 1995.</PARA>

The needs of all clients for information about the review process will form part of the proposed program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the education program mentioned above, the 1994-95 ATO Corporate Plan includes a corporate activity to upgrade access and equity strategies and programs.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has strategies in place which address the concerns raised by the Committee in recommendations 85-89.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has developed a two-pronged strategy for debt collection and enforcement based on a review recently conducted by a debt collection expert. This involves contacting new defaulters as early as possible and dealing with long term defaulters on a project basis. Since 1 July 1994, the Agency has collected more than $30 million of the total arrears outstanding as at that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency's Compliance Policy describes how decisions about appropriate enforcement action are to be made. The policy deals with both the decision to take enforcement action and the type of action which is appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case. The policy describes the types of enforcement action available and the hierarchy for taking action where more than one potential action is available. Decisions about whether enforcement action should commence and the most appropriate type of action are based on the liable parent's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the liable parent has the capacity to pay the debt and a payment arrangement is not possible or breaks down, the policy states that further action will be taken. This will be either administrative action or legal action depending upon the particular circumstances. The Agency will use administrative powers before taking legal action because of the convenience and cost effectiveness of using such powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency is addressing non-current year debt as part of the Arrears Project. In that process, sources and levels of income, and the age and size of the debt are factors considered in organising work for targeting the collection of outstanding arrears.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Arrears Project, the Agency has developed draft national procedures for dealing with cases in arrears. These procedures will be finalised by April 1995 and will then be implemented in all branch offices and their consistency will be monitored nationally.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exercise of the Registrar's power under section 120 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 is one of the options available in establishing a capacity to pay and negotiation of payment of arrears.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The powers under section 120 will be used, where appropriate, by staff working on the collection of non-current year arrears in the Arrears Project. The principles on which the Compliance Policy is based require the Agency to understand clients and their needs, work with clients to build trust and respect and to act fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a wide range of reasons for liable parents defaulting on their child support liabilities. It would be inequitable to treat all liable parents in the same way by conducting these interviews as a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would also be an inefficient use of resources to develop a procedure which required all non custodial parents to attend for reassessment or negotiation of payment of debts after 3 months of arrears, irrespective of their personal circumstances.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee stated that the Child Support Registrar has a statutory duty under subsection 113(2) of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to provide custodians with reasons why particular enforcement activities have been unsuccessful or why a decision has been made not to proceed further with enforcement action. The Agency believes that subsection 113(2) of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 provides the Registrar with the discretion to provide this information, but that it is not a statutory requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Compliance Policy states that the Registrar may inform the custodian of the outcome of action taken to collect outstanding debt, but will not disclose personal details about the liable parent or any other person (such as an address or place of employment) or any information which may hinder the progress of the collection activity. This type of information is not necessary for the purposes of keeping the custodian informed. There needs to be a balance between keeping custodians informed as to the current status of their case and protecting the rights of the non-custodial parent.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Russell Hill apex has been referred to as the forgotten corner of the Parliamentary Triangle. The proposed development will add considerable architectural substance to Walter Burley Griffins grand plan for the centre of the national capital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the project proceed at a limit of cost estimate of 205.53 million dollars at December 1994 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the Committee involves the construction of three new buildings to provide 54,000 square metres of new office accommodation, the refurbishment of four existing buildings, and a multi-level carpark.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eight of the older buildings at Russell are to be demolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Studies undertaken by a number of agencies indicated that these buildings are not suitable for refurbishment to provide the modern office accommodation required by Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed redevelopment was seen by the National Capital Planning Authority as providing a catalyst for the completion of the Parliamentary Triangle. Accordingly, the scope of the works includes the necessary roadworks in accordance with amendments to the National Capital Plan. I will say a few things about the impact of this on the Committee's inquiry later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the proposed work is based on a number of factors. First, the fact that the Headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and associated Service chiefs and program managers will remain in Canberra, at the Seat of Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the substantial investment in buildings at Russell over the past 20 years which are suitable for refurbishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, projections of staffing levels which arose from a 10 year accommodation and staffing study. This revealed that an estimated 6,800 staff will require 155,000 square metres of modern office accommodation. Some of this is specialised and is available elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Committee has concluded that the bulk of the requirement could be made available by undertaking substantial redevelopment at Russell.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I mentioned earlier, the National Capital Planning Authority has responded to the opportunity to prepare a new master plan for Russell.. This was placed on public exhibition in September last year and is under consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. The master plan remains as a draft until all statutory approval processes have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of issues relating to the draft master plan, including the design and siting of the proposed new buildings were raised in submissions to the Committee. The Committee believes these issues in no way diminish the need for Defence to be provided with modern office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is unfortunate that two Parliamentary committee's are examining simultaneously aspects of the same matter. The Committee has therefore recommended that future projects in Canberra which require amendments to the National Capital Plan should not be referred to the Committee until they have been approved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is aware of the significance of the proposal to Canberra and the National Capital Plan and that in recommending approval it will set in concrete future development of the Russell precinct well into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the project proceed provided the agreed amendment of the National Capital Plan does not require changes to the design and siting of roadworks and buildings. If changes are made, they will need to be further considered by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to a number of concerns about the standard of office accommodation to be provided, the Committee has indicated that there should be no false economies made in the fitout and accommodation standards. The Committee has reiterated a recommendation made in a report late last year that Defence should proceed with the study of the impact on staff efficiency and productivity of open space and other forms of office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the estimated cost of the proposed work, some 205 million dollars, the Committee has recommended that further value management exercises should be undertaken to reduce the cost of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on these bills. I am taking the opportunity to address the Senate and the community about economic management and the appropriation bills. It is important to point out to the Senate and the community the poor economic management that we have experienced under the Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to try to convey how a person from outside Australia would view our performance since 1983. From an outsider's perspective, what would you look at? You would look at two things. The first international measure of performance is how the Australian dollar has performed relative to the rest of the world over that period; in other words, what value is there in the Australian dollar? The other measure&mdash;and this is easily understood&mdash;is how interest rates have performed within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take a few minutes to run through the facts on the value of the Australian dollar and the behaviour of interest rates in this country, and thereby show that, from an international perspective, the performance of the government on both of these issues since it has been in power has been abysmal, that we are currently in a financial crisis in Australia and that the heat is on the government to perform and cut expenditure in its upcoming budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first key issue is the value of the Australian dollar. It is a fact that the Labor government has pursued short-term politics instead of chasing long-term goals for the good of mainstream Australians. There is no doubt that, if mainstream Australians knew about it, they would want a strong dollar. But what has happened? Let us go back and see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to Max Walsh for some figures in his article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. He pointed out that since 1981 the Australian dollar has gone down 75 per cent against the yen, 63 per cent against the German mark, 30 per cent against the US dollar, 23 per cent against the British pound and 46 per cent on a trade weighted index basis&mdash;the mix of our trade in Australia. Compared to our near neighbours to the north, the dollar's value has depreciated also against Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in Australia are much poorer today in international exchange rate terms than they were in the past. And it continues, because in the last few weeks the dollar has deteriorated substantially again. So we are getting poorer and poorer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other key measure of our economic performance when looking from outside Australia is interest rates. We can look at just the last few years to see what has happened. Comparing our figures with the US market, 10-year bond rates in Australia take a premium of at least two per cent above that in the USA. That means that, even though the financial markets are now global markets, international financiers view us as being so risky with regard to both inflation and fiscal deficits&mdash;in other words, government deficits&mdash;that we have to pay a two per cent premium for interest rates over and above the rest of the world, particularly the USA.</PARA></TALK.START>

By comparison, New Zealand's bond rates are about the same as those of the USA. In other words, New Zealand does not pay the premium with regard to long-term risk for inflation and government economic policies which Australia does. From outside Australia looking in, the government has done a very poor job of our economy. Why do we have this two per cent premium on bond rates? Is there an index of general interest rates here in Australia?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BX5">Senator GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. They don't trust the government because it has had a poor history in the past with regards to inflation and in more recent times a poor history of fiscal budget deficits. As I said earlier, I just make that comparison with our next door neighbour where the bonds are at a similar interest rate as in USA. The New Zealand government is running a fiscal surplus as opposed to our deficit. We have been running deficits for the last several years when we really did not need to do so. Even your government ministers are now owning up in recent days. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) said maybe you should have bitten into government expenditure at the last budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, if you look at the exchange rate and interest rates, the judgment from outside of Australia of the performance of the Australian economy is one of very poor performance. I hope the government does take it on board in its next budget that it is looking at now that it does cut into expenditure sufficiently and aim for fiscal surpluses; in other words, savings in the very near future. That will then have some impact on having to stabilise interest rates in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the new arrangements for the estimates committee hearings dealing with the appropriations bills, the coalition and the minor parties indicated that we wanted to have answers to all of the questions that we raised at estimates committee hearings before we allowed the appropriations bills to pass. It is on that basis that I wish to speak on the third reading of the appropriations bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the estimates committee hearing on 3 March 1995 there was lengthy questioning and argument over the payment made by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to its former managing director, Mr David Hill, on the termination of his contract. The questioning followed questioning at the previous Senate estimates committee hearings on 29 November 1994 and 16 February 1995 regarding Mr Hill's departure from the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around 4 November 1994 there were a number of press reports and media interviews by Mr David Hill indicating that he was intending to resign from the ABC next June. In all of that media exposure it was indicated that Mr Hill was resigning of his own accord with words from him like, `It's time for me to look for a new adventure', and `I've decided to resign. I'm immensely satisfied with the shape the ABC is in', and further, `I've decided to resign on 1 June 1995.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was subsequently rumoured that Mr Hill had received a pay-out from the ABC of anything up to $500,000. On 29 November 1994 at an estimates committee hearing, Senator Alston raised some questions about Mr Hill's pay-out and I asked whether the officer present, in that instance, Mr Lidbetter, could give me an example of where the ABC had previously made an ex-gratia payment to someone who had broken their contract and who had left early. I questioned them on how anyone on a contract could possibly break that contract, retire early and still be paid a fairly substantial redundancy payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officer confirmed that he did not know of any situation where the ABC had paid out anything except normal entitlements for accrued leave and other normal entitlements and he added, `and what have you.' On being pressed as to what `what have you' meant, it was indicated that that might be benefits to which he was entitled under the contract. The officer confirmed that they were not discretionary payments but simply entitlements like superannuation and allowances mentioned in the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition senators then asked for a copy of Mr Hill's contract so that senators could determine whether or not Mr Hill was entitled to any payment. There then followed a long argument about the confidentiality of the contract and whether the ABC was required to give information and details to a Senate estimates committee. I think the outcome of that debate is now quite clear and, although it was argued about on many occasions in that estimates committee, I do think the precedents from the Senate, the rulings from various Senate committees and from the chamber itself indicate that the ABC has no right whatsoever to refuse to give information of any type to the Senate estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party senators and the minister made every attempt possible to prevent the committee from being informed. Although the officers at that stage, on 29 November 1994, could not tell us what payment was being made to Mr Hill, the chair of the ABC, Professor Mark Armstrong, issued a press release on 20 December 1994 in which he said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an appropriate termination payment has been negotiated which takes into account the residual value of Mr Hill's current contract of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result, again at the estimates committee on 16 February 1995, I and my colleagues pursued the basis upon which Mr Hill, who had resigned from the ABC ahead of his contract, could possibly be entitled to any payment. It was my view that, having breached his contract in terminating it early, he should have been sued for damages by the ABC for breach of contract rather than being paid a fairly substantial amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that hearing, we again trawled over the arguments on whether or not the Senate committee was entitled to a full disclosure from the ABC. It was pointed out that the ABC had been directed by the committee to produce the contract, but as at 16 February 1995 it had not been tabled before the committee. In direct contravention of the Senate's requirements, the ABC again refused to produce the contract. After a lot more argument, an officer said to me&mdash;and this is on page 123 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be grateful if you would consider receiving the document in some other way.</PARA>
<PARA>I then quite clearly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you are offering it to me in confidence so I can look through it, find out that information and come back and question you about it, then I am very happy that you made the offer and I would be very happy to accept.</PARA>
<PARA>I then clearly indicated that, having received the contract, I would intend to question the ABC further on any aspect that I thought was an inappropriate use of taxpayers' money. Quite clearly, I was indicating that I would be pursuing further the question of the payment of moneys to Mr Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I subsequently received a copy of the contract. The covering letter, dated 27 February 1995, from Professor Mark Armstrong, whilst indicating that he was forwarding the document in confidence, did indicate in the last paragraph as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that you may choose to pursue questioning about certain aspects of the contract at a later Estimates hearing. I would request that in doing so you have regard to my representation to the Select Committee and its decision.</PARA>
<PARA>That just showed that Professor Armstrong acknowledged that I was intending to pursuing questions once I had read the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract, as it turned out, was quite an unexceptional document, and it was very appropriate in its simplicity and clarity of terms. There is absolutely no clause in that contract which provided for a payment to Mr Hill upon his terminating the agreement in advance of its terms. As I read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 9 March 1995 at page 176, clause 14.1 of the contract says that Mr Hill may terminate his appointment at any time on giving three months written notice to the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 14.2 then provided that the board could terminate the appointment of Mr Hill with payment to date of termination in the event of any of the following occasions, which, generally speaking, were the normal contractual conditions of fault on behalf of the employee. Nowhere in the contract was there any provision for Mr Hill to terminate the contract and be paid out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then raised at some considerable length in the estimates committee the question of the payment and pleaded with the ABC officers to indicate to me the basis upon which Mr Hill was to be paid a large sum of money. It transpired that Mr Hill received a payment of $390,000, which officers indicated was calculated on the basis of the amount which would have been paid to Mr Hill had the contract run its full term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of the officers could indicate to me at the estimates committee the legal basis upon which that payment was being made to Mr Hill, because it quite clearly was not provided for in the contract. Notwithstanding that this particular question had been pursued at the two previous estimates committees some several months prior to that, the minister at the table meekly told the Senate committee that there was no-one in the Senate estimates committee who could answer my question, whilst it was quite obvious that that question was going to be asked. This was the ultimate cop out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister who was at the table, Senator Faulkner, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on page 181, indicated that he would take my questions on notice. The chair, Senator Carr, at page 185, indicated that the committee would be convening again for the purposes of getting someone to the estimates committee who could answer the questions. It was indicated to the committee that officers then present at senior management level had not been party to the negotiations with Mr Hill and that it was really a matter between the board and its chairman and Mr Hill. The implication was that Professor Armstrong would attend before the committee and explain how the ABC would pay $390,000 worth of taxpayers' money to an officer who had resigned when there was no apparent legal obligation on the ABC so to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to the termination of the estimates committee that night, some of the senior officers spoke to me in confidence and I later received a telephone call at my electorate office from the chairman of the ABC, Professor Armstrong, who in a lengthy conversation indicated to me certain matters&mdash;again in confidence. In both instances I intend to respect those confidences. As was arranged in my telephone conversation with Professor Armstrong, he then wrote to me on 14 March a three-page letter in which he explained certain matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now in a position where, having indicated to the Senate through the estimates committee that I considered there was an inappropriate payment of taxpayers' money from the ABC to Mr Hill&mdash;in view of the fact that Mr Hill had resigned prior to termination of his contract and that his contract had no provision for payment of compensation or redundancy in those circumstances&mdash;I have insisted at the estimates committee that the ABC explain this apparent legal and administrative inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I said publicly at those estimates committee hearings that the payment was inappropriate, the explanation has now been given to me in confidence and, whilst I may now be satisfied, the Senate and the Australian taxpayer, who are footing the bill, are not being taken into confidence and do not know the reason. I am now at the stage where I should insist that the minister provide the answers to the questions taken on notice and, further, that the committee reconvene, as the chairman undertook, so that the officer who has knowledge&mdash;apparently, the chairman, Professor Armstrong&mdash;can appear before the committee to give the necessary explanations to the Australian public. Until that happened, the opposition had indicated that it was not prepared to allow the appropriation bills to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday night there was a further meeting of the Senate estimates committee, which was convened to hear the Telstra witnesses. At that committee hearing, I indicated to the chairman that I intended to hold the committee to its obligation to reconvene and hear this evidence, unless there was some other way out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an attempt to avoid holding up the appropriations bill and reconvening the committee, I believe that my duty to the Australian public as an elected representative would be satisfied if I were able to make the following statements in relation to the termination of Mr Hill's contract. I indicate to the Senate that I did last week, when I prepared this speech, forward by fax to Professor Armstrong a copy of what I was going to say. I apprised Professor Armstrong of the nature of what I am intending to say to allow him to confirm that he has no objection to my using information contained in his confidential letter to me. Professor Armstrong has assured me that he has no objection and he thanked me for my courtesy and cooperation. He was realist enough to understand that it was better to settle on a form of words to explain what this matter was all about than to have the whole question publicly examined in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For a number of reasons which were explained to me in detail in the letter from Professor Armstrong, the chairman and the directors of the ABC had decided that it was an appropriate time from the ABC's point of view for Mr Hill to move on and for a new managing director to be appointed. Mr Hill was reluctant to leave the ABC for a number of reasons, including those about his financial loss. The board acknowledged that it was not in a position which could bring matters to a conclusion relying on the ordinary contractual principles. Unilateral action was likely to generate substantial legal dispute. There followed many weeks of intensive negotiation towards an acceptable financial basis for settlement and, as a consequence of these negotiations, Mr Hill announced his retirement. The board felt that the payment of an amount which represented the balance of Mr Hill's entitlement under his contract was the least expensive way of resolving the matter to the satisfaction of the board and the people the board serves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Professor Armstrong assured me in his letter that, as the person who had carriage of all the negotiations with Mr Hill, nobody holding any government or political office attempted to influence him as to the amount which should be paid to Mr Hill. I accept Professor Armstrong's assurance. Professor Armstrong has given this assurance on the basis of my statement to the estimates committee that I considered that Mr Hill was being favourably treated because of his political connections. It is fairly well known that Mr Hill has a close connection with the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party and there were many assertions made that his original appointment to the ABC had political overtones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern in many quarters that the ABC shows a political bias towards the ALP and that has in some circles been attributed to Mr Hill's management of the ABC. There was a fairly obvious and public falling out between the Minister for Communications (Mr Lee) the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Mr Hill not long before Mr Hill announced his retirement from the ABC and it was again opined in various quarters that it was in the interests of the Labor Party that Mr Hill should be removed from a position of influence in the national broadcaster. The suspicion remains that Mr Hill was removed from office for political considerations, but I do accept without question Professor Armstrong's assurance that the amount paid to Mr Hill was one which he himself negotiated and was not in any way influenced by anyone political. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I hope that this has been a lesson to government authorities to be careful in the appointment of managing directors or chief executive officers who are seen to be politically partisan. Appointments must be made on the basis of the best person for the job, not on the basis of one's political leanings. This is perhaps a problem when a board such as the board of the ABC comprises many members who are acknowledged members of the Australian Labor Party. I acknowledge for the record that I do not make reference to Professor Armstrong when I make those last comments. I also note for the record that Professor Armstrong was not part of the board when Mr Hill was first appointed to the ABC. As far as I am concerned, I am now aware&mdash;as is, I hope, the taxpayer&mdash;of just what the circumstances were surrounding Mr Hill's departure from the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In concluding, can I say again that the whole exercise over Mr Hill's contract and what was paid to him did have another element to it, and that is that it did again demonstrate quite clearly that this Senate is supreme when it comes to inquiring into government business agencies or any government board, any operation that is funded by the taxpayer. In spite of the attempts by the board initially, by the minister, by the Labor Party chairman to deny the committee that opportunity to get information as to the expenditure of taxpayers' money, it transpired, through some assistance from people who had the knowledge that was needed and by certain of the committee senators, that the primacy of the Senate remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate must always have the opportunity to obtain information from government bodies and agencies who are funded by the taxpayer. I was particularly pleased to see that the power of the Senate and the right of the Senate to obtain this information were again demonstrated and eventually accepted by all. I think that should be a lesson to any government business enterprise, any government agency which in the future might try to hide things from estimates committees by claiming that there is some confidentiality or some privacy to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It has been indicated in the Senate before that people who apply for very highly paid jobs on boards of organisations like the ABC should be made aware before they sign their contract that their contract, because it is being funded by the taxpayer, is a public document. They must be aware when they go into those contracts that there is a possibility that those contracts will, in fact, be examined by the representatives of the people at some future time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the ABC now understands that. Certainly other government business enterprises and government agencies will, I hope, take note of that and be aware of that so we do not, on every occasion, have to go through this very long and detailed argument about whether the Senate was entitled to that information or whether it was not. It is another victory for the Senate, another victory for the scrutiny that this chamber exercises over government administration and the expenditure of taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is the central element of a new national competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will establish processes and institutions to encourage competition, not just in particular sectors, but across the whole economy. This bill, and the associated draft agreements between the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments, have the potential to trigger reform initiatives for many years to come. Implementing this policy is the most important single development in micro-economic reform in recent years. Ultimately, the ability of the economy to grow, to provide jobs and an improved standard of living, depends upon how well the productive potential of the economy is employed and enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Federal Government set out clearly in its White Paper on Growth and Employment, creating the conditions for new job growth is its principal task. The payoff from this bill for ordinary Australians is very real. It paves the way for cheaper prices, more growth and more jobs. It is an important element of our ambition to reduce unemployment to around 5% by the end of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms affirm the role of competition policy as an explicit element of the broad range of considerations the Federal Government brings to policy decisions; complementing social justice objectives delivered through comprehensive social security and community services programs; protection for consumers, employees and the environment through specific laws; industry development through infrastructure investment and business assistance programs; and stable macro-economic policy settings which maximise the rate of sustainable economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The origins of the bill may be traced to 1991 when the Commonwealth and the States and Territories agreed to examine a national approach to competition policy. In 1992, the Government commissioned the National Competition Policy Review, chaired by Professor Fred Hilmer. The Hilmer Report was completed in August 1993. Since then the Government has been engaged in extensive consultations with State and Territory Governments on implementation of the Report. The Report was discussed by the Council of Australian Governments in February 1994 and August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vision of the Hilmer Report was for a national competition policy in which the Commonwealth, States and Territories cooperated to ensure that universal and uniformly applied rules of market conduct apply to all market participants regardless of their form of ownership. The Commonwealth has worked hard to realise this vision with the cooperation of the States and Territories. While there are still some issues to be resolved, the Commonwealth sincerely hopes that the issues can be resolved at the forthcoming COAG meeting in April. In this regard the Commonwealth welcomes the strong support for a co-operative national approach to competition policy as expressed in the communique from the States and Territory forum held in Adelaide on 24 February 1995. Agreement at the COAG meeting would see the signing of the draft agreements at that meeting and the subsequent application by the States and Territories of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to those areas which are outside the Commonwealth's Constitutional reach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian business is increasingly operating on a nationally integrated basis, and a more national approach is needed for business regulation. Businesses and consumers will benefit from the uniform protection of consumer and business rights that a national competition policy will provide. The full measure of these benefits can only be achieved with all governments working together to provide consistent and certain competition rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been prepared with the benefit of wide ranging consultation with the public since 1992. The Hilmer Committee received more than 130 public submissions. In preparing draft legislation in response to the Hilmer Report, officers of Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, met with a range of business, consumer, union and environmental representatives. A package containing a draft of this bill and draft intergovernmental agreements was released in September 1994 for public comment. The package attracted more than 60 substantive submissions from the public. The broad thrust of the package met with general community approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of public comments received, various changes were made to the draft bill to tidy up matters of detail and to streamline and increase the flexibility of processes established by these reforms. The package was also amended to better reflect the fact that competition policy occurs in the context of the broader policy concerns of governments and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main elements of the bill take the form of amendments to the Trade Practices Act and the Prices Surveillance Act. The Trade Practices Act will be amended so that, with State and Territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia. A new legal regime will be created which facilitates businesses obtaining access to the services of certain essential infrastructure facilities. The Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority will be merged to form the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and a new advisory body, the National Competition Council, will be established. Prices surveillance processes will be streamlined, and their jurisdiction extended to State and Territory government businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is complemented by two draft inter-governmental agreements. The first of these agreements, the Conduct Code Agreement, sets out processes for amendments to the competition laws of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, and for appointments to the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Competition Principles Agreement sets out arrangements for appointments to, and deciding the work program of, the National Competition Council. It also sets out the principles governments will be agreeing to follow in relation to prices oversight, structural reform of public monopolies, review of anti-competitive legislation and regulations, access to services provided by means of essential facilities and elimination of net competitive advantages enjoyed by government businesses where they compete with the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By signing the Competition Principles Agreement, Governments will be agreeing to processes for further micro-economic reforms. In general, individual Governments will be responsible for setting their own timetables and agendas for progressing these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement does not compel specific reforms by Governments. It is not about competition for competition's sake. This is reflected in the fact that the Agreement provides a consistent requirement for public benefit tests to guide policy decisions. Many such decisions are taken currently by governments without the discipline of public benefit tests, other than through the normal parliamentary processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular the Agreement, and indeed the package of reforms in total, does not compel, or even encourage, Governments to privatise government business enterprises, nor to abandon or reduce community service obligations. The package, as with the report by the Hilmer committee, is silent on the issue of public versus private ownership. The Agreement sets out certain processes that should be followed where a government business enterprise is to be privatised or exposed to competition for the first time. The decision as to whether, and when, a government business enterprise might be privatised remains the exclusive responsibility of the owning government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Commonwealth has illustrated in the telecommunications industry, privatisation and the introduction of competition are entirely separate decisions. It is possible, and in many cases clearly desirable, to introduce competition and realise its economic benefits while retaining public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Competition Principles Agreement will facilitate a more careful and systematic consideration of the delivery of community service obligations (CSOs) by State and Territory governments where they decide to undertake structural reform of their business enterprises. It includes no mechanisms or incentives for governments to reduce their commitment to the effective delivery of these CSOs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth already has in place a set of administrative arrangements for the delivery of CSOs by its business enterprises. These are contained in the Accountability and Ministerial Oversight Arrangements for Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises. These arrangements provide for CSOs to be explicit and transparent, to be provided at minimum cost and, where provided by government business enterprises through cross-subsidies, to be reflected in the financial targets of those enterprises. These arrangements are already operating effectively in the delivery of CSOs such as those in telecommunications and in postal services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken together, the bill and the two draft inter-governmental agreements represent a complete response to the recommendations of the Hilmer Committee. In many respects the package is simply a statement of common sense. It is not a radical notion that businesses should not be permitted to engage in anti-competitive conduct. It is not a radical notion that consumers generally benefit from greater competition, and that where possible, greater competition should be encouraged. It is not a radical notion that in reviewing legislation or market structures, due consideration should be given to opportunities to enhance efficiency through competition. But the great step forward made by this package is that it sets out these statements of common sense for all to see; it creates new institutions better able to encourage businesses and governments to act in accordance with these statements of common sense; and the resulting principles will be applied to all Australian businesses regardless of ownership or legal form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is very proud of its record on micro-economic reform, which is delivering significant benefits to Australian consumers and businesses. Until now these reforms have largely focused on particular industry sectors such as telecommunications or domestic aviation. The reforms which result from this package may not be individually as large as some of the earlier initiatives, but taken together they will produce significant gains for the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry Commission's analysis of the growth and revenue benefits of Hilmer and related reforms shows that these reforms are overwhelmingly good for the Australian economy and will produce gains in output, consumption and employment. Moreover these benefits are widely distributed throughout the community, with very few industries projected to lose from the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Commonwealth recognises that while the benefits of reform are shared widely throughout the community, any adjustment costs may be borne by much smaller groups. The introduction of competition in previously protected sectors can, for instance, affect the employment conditions of people working in those sectors. The Government has developed labour market programs (including training and retraining) to assist the process of adjustment for these people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to understand that this Government is not interested in reform or competition for its own sake. The package recognises that economic efficiency is one element of a broader public policy context which also includes social considerations. Explicit recognition is given to these broader elements of the public interest in the bill and in the Competition Principles Agreement. The package gives appropriate recognition, not only to competition and efficiency considerations, but to all the other policy objectives which governments must balance in making policy decisions, such as ecologically sustainable development, social welfare and equity considerations, community service obligations, and the interests of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package gives clear recognition to these other objectives, with the clear intent that governments should give full and proper consideration to these matters when they make decisions about economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been some concern that implementing a national competition policy will lead to the wholesale dismantling of the public sector. This is a serious misunderstanding of the proposed reforms. For the most part, these reforms are relevant only after governments have taken the threshold policy decision to introduce competition, and then only to `significant' business activities. Many public sector organisations have both commercial and non-commercial functions, and these reforms are not designed to affect the non-commercial functions undertaken for governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In sectors such as education, health, welfare, community services and labour market programs where the public sector has, and will continue to have, a dominant role, the relevance of competition policies will be limited to those circumstances where enterprises are engaged in business activity. In most cases where this is an issue at all, this is a small part of their overall role, or ancillary to the provision of core services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, government schools are not normally engaged in business activity. While they may be seen as competing with private schools (for students), this is not competition to earn revenue and profits, and is therefore not a `business' activity to which the competitive neutrality principles apply. Similarly, these reforms will not be relevant to public hospitals treating public patients or providing in-house hospital services, but may be relevant where those hospitals are treating private patients or operating commercial cleaning services. In these areas a public hospital would be directly competing with private firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will always be a legitimate role for the public sector in Australia, but this role is evolving and changing over time. The Government does not see these reforms accelerating those changes in the public sector's role, but the competition principles will provide a coherent framework for responding to the implications and consequences of those changes, particularly in the areas of third party access, prices oversight and competitive neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the evolving nature of the public sector, the Commonwealth has established arrangements to provide safeguards for its employees. The treatment of employment conditions in Commonwealth public sector agencies is primarily governed by legislation, including when those agencies undergo changes such as a transfer of ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees in Commonwealth agencies derive most of their employment conditions from awards and enterprise agreements. Where there is no change of employer (ie. where the agency is incorporated and the sale is by way of sale of shares) awards and enterprise agreements are unaffected by the change. Where there is a change of employer (eg. where the agency's assets are sold), it is usual for awards and enterprise agreements to transmit to the new employer by operation of s. 149 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. If there is any doubt as to transmission, it has been the Government's practice to consider taking other steps to ensure transmission, such as including appropriate provisions in sale contracts. There may be occasions when some conditions (such as long service leave) are not derived from industrial agreements. In such cases, the Government has encouraged the parties to negotiate any changes to these conditions with an objective being to maintain broad equivalence in the overall package of employment conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth considers that all governments have a responsibility to have in place appropriate safeguards for their employees. The Government does not see this package as a device for reducing the wages and conditions of public sector employees. Erosion of their wages and conditions does not equate with the `benefits' in the Competition Principles Agreement against which policy changes need to be assessed. The Government's vision, as enunciated in Working Nation, is to achieve an economy based on high wages and high productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package provides strong incentives for State and Territory governments to participate in the new regime. Participating governments will retain the capacity to exempt specific conduct from the competition laws. They will also have a role in making appointments to the new institutions, in determining the work program of the new National Competition Council, and in a range of other matters. Non-participating governments will not obtain the benefits of involvement in the new regime. For example, they will not have the power to exempt conduct from the competition laws, although in all jurisdictions it will be possible to obtain administrative authorisation for anti-competitive conduct which on balance is in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If agreement cannot be reached at the forthcoming COAG meeting the Commonwealth is determined to continue alone with the proposed competition policy reforms, although this would require some changes to the bill. The Commonwealth realises that this would be a less desirable outcome to a truly national and cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. However, many of the reforms could still be implemented by the Commonwealth proceeding on its own. The payoff from these reforms for ordinary Australians is too great for the Commonwealth to allow the whole process to falter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to examine the main provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Competitive Conduct Rules of the Trade Practices Act (Part IV)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part IV of the Trade Practices Act prohibits various forms of anti-competitive conduct, such as contracts which substantially lessen competition, misuse of market power and mergers and acquisitions which substantially lessen competition. One of the main features of the bill is that it extends the operation of these competitive conduct rules to currently exempt businesses, and facilitates their further extension by State and Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Limitations on the Commonwealth's constitutional power have meant that unincorporated businesses operating solely in intra-State trade are currently not covered by the competitive conduct rules in the Trade Practices Act. This sector of the economy includes major businesses, such as those operated by some legal firms. This bill is part of a co-operative legislative scheme, involving the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, which will apply the competitive conduct rules to these businesses. To achieve coverage of these businesses, the bill creates a form of text to be known as "the Competition Code". The Competition Code contains the rules set out in Part IV of the Trade Practices Act, modified to refer to "persons" rather than "corporations". The text of the Competition Code is to be made operative by State and Territory laws which will apply the Code within each jurisdiction. It is envisaged that the State and Territory legislation will commence within 12 months of the commencement of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to ensure there are no gaps in coverage, there will be overlap between Part IV and the Competition Code. Most businesses will be subject to both. However, it will not be possible to award penalties under both Part IV and the Competition Code, in respect of the same conduct. There will only be one enforcement agency, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and all enforcement action will be brought in the Federal Court. The draft intergovernmental Conduct Code Agreement indicates a commitment to maintain consistency between the prohibitions in Part IV and the prohibitions in the Competition Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another major extension of coverage which is achieved by the bill is the removal of "shield of the Crown" protection from State and Territory Government businesses. A State or Territory government department or authority, which represents the Crown, will now be required to comply with Part IV of the Trade Practices Act to the extent that it carries on a business. Certain forms of government activity, such as taxing, licensing and compulsory acquisition of primary products are unlikely ever to be legally construed as "business". To avoid any doubt, provisions have been included which expressly indicate that such activities do not amount to business. Similarly it is not legally possible for an individual entity to carry on business with itself.  Provisions have been included which make clear that there is no "business" activity when two government departments deal with each other, because they are both part of a single legal entity, the Crown.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presently, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories can legislate or make regulations which provide for exemptions from the competitive conduct rules of the Trade Practices Act. Under this bill the potential for such exemptions from the Trade Practices Act will be considerably restricted. The Commonwealth and participating States and Territories will only be able to make exemptions by laws which expressly refer to the Trade Practices Act. Existing laws which do not comply with this new requirement will cease to provide exemption after three years. The Conduct Code Agreement requires parties enacting such legislation to inform the Commission in writing within 30 days of the legislation being enacted. Where there is an urgent need for exempting legislation, regulations may be passed, but these will only be operative for two years. In addition to these measures, the Commonwealth will remove from the Trade Practices Act the provision which expressly permits regulations exempting particular classes of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An objects clause is to be inserted into the Trade Practices Act, indicating that its purpose is to enhance the welfare of Australians, through the promotion of competition and fair trading practices and provision for consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some modifications to the competitive conduct rules are being made, prior to extension of the rules to currently exempt businesses. These will give the act and the Commission a greater capacity to deal with modern business practices and minimise the need for separate exempting legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The modifications will make it possible for the Commission to authorise agreements between competitors to fix the price of goods, and to authorise firms to engage in resale price maintenance. The Commission will only give such authorisation where it assesses there is a benefit to the public in the arrangements. The prohibition against price discrimination is to be repealed as the provision is largely redundant, and the conduct it is designed to address is adequately covered by other provisions of the act. Prohibitions dealing with the re-supply of goods are to be extended to deal with the re-supply of services. A scheme of notification is to be introduced in respect of conduct known as third line forcing, which includes practices such as selling goods or services on condition that the buyer also buys goods or services from a third party. Under the notification scheme, people proposing to engage in third line forcing may notify the Commission of the proposed conduct, and they will gain immunity from legal action in respect of the conduct. The immunity commences a prescribed period after notification and operates unless or until the Commission issues a notice to the effect that the detriment of the conduct outweighs any benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill inserts a new Part into the Trade Practices Act, to establish a legal regime to facilitate third parties obtaining access to the services of certain essential facilities of national significance. The notion underlying the regime is that access to certain facilities with natural monopoly characteristics, such as electricity grids or gas pipelines, is needed to encourage competition in related markets, such as electricity generation or gas production. Access to such facilities can be achieved if a person seeking access is successful in having the service "declared" and then negotiates access with the service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new National Competition Council will consider applications for declaration of particular services. It may recommend declaration of a service if it is satisfied that access to the service would promote competition, that it would be uneconomical for anyone to develop another facility to provide the service, that the facility is of national significance, that access would not cause undue risk to health or safety, that access is not already the subject of an effective access regime, and that access would not be against the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council's recommendation will be considered by the designated Minister, who will decide whether or not to declare the service. Where a facility is owned or operated by a State or Territory authority and that State or Territory is a party to the Competition Principles Agreement, the designated Minister will be the responsible State or Territory Minister. Otherwise, the designated Minister will be the responsible Commonwealth Minister. Ministers' decisions will be subject to appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once a service is declared, parties will be free to negotiate their own terms and conditions of access, including through private arbitration. If it is not possible to reach agreement, they can notify the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of a dispute, and the Commission can make a determination setting the terms and conditions of access. Private arbitration can be enforced using the new access regime if, subject to a public interest test, they are registered by the Commission. Determinations by the Commission may be appealed to the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an alternative to this process, the owner or operator of a facility can offer an undertaking to the Commission about the terms and conditions on which it will provide access to third parties. If the Commission accepts such an undertaking, the services provided by the facility cannot be declared by the Council. This provides a means by which the owner or operator can obtain certainty about access arrangements, before a third party seeks access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Prices Oversight</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing functions of the Prices Surveillance Authority will be taken over by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and to the existing functions of prices surveillance and price inquiries will be added price monitoring. Under prices surveillance, the price of a declared product will not be permitted to be increased above its highest endorsed price in the previous 12 months, without notification to the Commission. Price inquiries involve studies of limited duration of matters relating to prices for the supply of particular goods or services, and result in reports to the Minister. Under prices monitoring, the Minister may request ongoing monitoring of prices, costs and profits in any industry or business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that price monitoring will be less intrusive and involve less administrative burden for businesses than prices surveillance. Surveillance will continue to be appropriate for firms with substantial market power in substantial markets, where there is strong reason to believe firms will use their market power to increase prices. Price monitoring may be appropriate where there is concern about the effectiveness of competition, a history of price problems, or community concern about price levels or movements, or where industries have been recently reformed or deregulated. Where price monitoring fails to resolve unacceptable pricing practices or uncovers structural problems in the market, firms may be declared for prices surveillance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with the aim of achieving a truly national competition policy, the Prices Surveillance Act 1983 will be amended to permit, in certain circumstances, price oversight of State and Territory Government businesses. Prices surveillance will be possible where the State or Territory concerned has agreed or where the National  Competition Council has, on the request of an Australian government, recommended declaration of the authority and the Commonwealth Minister has consulted the appropriate Minister of the State or Territory concerned. The Council can not recommend declaration if the government business is already subject to effective prices oversight. Price monitoring of State or Territory businesses will only be permitted with the agreement of the State or Territory concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Institutions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be formed by merging the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority. The Commission will be responsible for enforcement of the competition and consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the provisions of the Competition Code. It will also make determinations under the new access regime, and be responsible for prices surveillance, inquiries and monitoring under the Prices Surveillance Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Competition Council will be an entirely new body, with a Council President and up to four other Councillors, and around 20 staff. It will make recommendations about access declarations and prices oversight of State or Territory government businesses. It may also conduct, or provide assistance with, reviews under the Competition Principles Agreement. The reviews it undertakes will be in accordance with a work program determined by participating governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Tribunal will be renamed as the Australian Competition Tribunal. It will retain its current responsibilities, including appeals from authorisation decisions of the Commission, and it will assume new responsibilities for appeals from decisions in access matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Timing</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that amendments to the competitive conduct rules will commence in July 1995, and that State application laws will be operative within a further 12 months. The new institutional arrangements, the access regime and amendments to the Prices Surveillance Act will commence in the second half of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will result in a substantial increase in the workload of the Commission and, possibly, the Tribunal. The competitive conduct rules will extend to areas of the economy now excluded, both by virtue of the amendments directly made in the bill and pursuant to the conferral of functions by State and Territory laws which the bill facilitates. The Commission and the Tribunal will also have important new functions under the access regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will therefore require additional resources to those currently provided to the Trade Practices Commission and Prices Surveillance Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Competition Council will require resources for up to five Councillors and around 20 staff. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will be funding both the Commission and the Council. Resource arrangements for the two bodies will be considered after the April meeting of the Council of Australian Governments and announced closer to the time of their establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill ushers in a new era in national competition policy. The new integrated and complete approach to national competition policy, which balances economic efficiency and broader elements of the public interest, will give Australia one of the most sophisticated competition policies in the world. It will help to dismantle private and regulatory barriers to competition, and to promote competition across the economy. It will provide the domestic policy arrangements we need to realise the opportunities arising from our external trade policies and the dynamic developments in the international economy. The reward will be an economy that provides more opportunities to satisfy the aspirations of all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMUNICATIONS AND TOURISM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends three acts administered within the Communications and the Arts portfolio and one act administered within the Tourism portfolio. It also repeals an act within the Tourism portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are of a minor policy or technical nature and do not contain any significant new policy measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will refer in turn to each of the acts being amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 repeals two subsections of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of subsection 14(3) addresses an oversight concerning the retirement age of appointed Australian Tourist Commission Board members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1991 was intended to remove age restrictions in regard to the appointment and the continuation of appointment of nonexecutive statutory office holders in the then Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories portfolio. However, while the subsection restricting the age of appointment for Australian Tourist Commission Board members was removed in 1991, subsection 14(3), which relates to the continuation of appointment after the age of 65, was overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment removes this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of subsection 42(3) of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 will remove possible confusion relating to conditions of employment of Australian Tourist Commission officers. Subsection 42(3) currently provides that a person shall not be employed by the Board on terms and conditions more favourable than those applying to the Managing Director.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world environment in which the Australian Tourist Commission operates has changed considerably since 1987 when this legislation was introduced. In some countries where the Australian Tourist Commission has overseas offices, the high cost of living has resulted in substantially higher wages in Australian dollar terms than those prevailing in Australia. The amendment will remove any anomaly in relation to the conditions of employment for overseas staff by removing the limitation preventing employment on terms and conditions more favourable than those of the Managing Director.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australian Tourist Commission (Transitional Provisions) Act 1987</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill repeals the Australian Tourist Commission (Transitional Provisions) Act 1987 because it no longer has any application. The purpose of this act was to protect contractual arrangements in place in 1987 when the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 came into effect. This is the usual practice when a statutory authority moves from the authority of one act to another. In this case one of the purposes was to enable the then Managing Director of the Australian Tourist Commission to continue in office in accordance with the terms and conditions of his original appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to clarify the operation of section 73 of that act in situations where the sole commercial television broadcasting licensee in a market seeks permission to operate a second commercial television broadcasting service in that market and to clarify the interaction between that process and the price-based allocation of new licences under Part 4 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 73 of the act already provides that, if additional commercial television broadcasting licences can be allocated in an area where there is only one commercial television broadcasting licensee, the existing licensee may apply for permission to operate a second service in that licence area. It also provides that the Australian Broadcasting Authority may give that licensee permission to operate the second service if it is satisfied that it is unlikely that another person would be in a position to operate another commercial television broadcasting service in that licence area. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the act to provide a specific mechanism for the allocation of a second licence to the original licensee and ensures that in this situation there is an exemption from the prohibitions on a person being able to exercise control over more than one commercial television broadcasting licence in the same licence area set out in sections 53 and 55 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill amends the act to provide that a price-based allocation process proposed to be conducted by the ABA is able to proceed before the ABA need consider giving a permission to operate a second service to an existing licensee under section 73.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 to remove the Minister's power to vary or revoke or impose further conditions on transmitter licences, which were formerly licence warrants or retransmission permits granted under the Broadcasting Act 1942 and which continue in force under sections 100 or 102 of the Radiocommunications Act 1992. The amendments give the relevant powers to the ABA, in the case of licences under section 102, or the Spectrum Management Agency, in the case of licences under section 100. This division of powers reflects the bodies who exercise similar powers in relation to any new licences which are issued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992  to remove the transitional provisions which relate to political broadcasting. Those provisions had been included in the Broadcasting Act 1942 but at the time the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 was drafted they were the subject of a challenge in the High Court. As a consequence they were kept on foot by means of a transitional provision. The High Court held the provisions to be invalid in the case of Australian Capital Television v the Commonwealth. The amendment does not affect the existing provisions relating to political broadcasts set out in Schedule 2 of the Broadcasting Services Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Radiocommunications Act 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to enable the SMA, in determining a price based allocation system for specified transmitter licences, to limit eligibility to apply for those licences to persons who are authorised under that act or other law to operate radiocommunications transmitters of that kind, or to provide the services for which the transmitters will be used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the Radiocommunications Act 1992  to enable radio inspectors to enter premises to turn off Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons which have been activated spontaneously or otherwise. At present the power to enter premises can only be exercised where the inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment removes this requirement but retains the requirement that premises only be entered in circumstances of such seriousness and urgency as to justify entry without the authority of a court order or warrant. The amendment will enable inspectors to enter premises, whether occupied or not, where the transmitter is interfering with radiocommunications essential to the safety of human life, interfering substantially with the operations of police or emergency services or is causing substantial loss or damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in the bill are not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment, Education and Training Act 1988 established the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central purpose of the act was to enhance and streamline independent advisory structures in employment, education and training in a manner consistent with the high economic and social priority placed on these activities by the Government. The provisions of the act have enabled the Government to obtain this advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NBEET and its Councils have served the Government well in providing independent advice on a wide range of topics. However, organisations such as NBEET should be reviewed from time to time to ensure that their role, functions and structure continue to meet current needs. Therefore, when NBEET was established, the Government made a commitment to review operations of the Board and of the Councils and the Commonwealth/State Consultative Committee which are part of the NBEET framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That review was undertaken by Professor Kenneth Wiltshire, Professor of Public Administration at the University of Queensland, whose report was received by the Government last year. Professor Wiltshire found that NBEET had fulfilled the bulk of the high expectations held for it at the time it was established. The Government fully endorses this general conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board and its Councils have provided the Government with a wide range of valuable advice, both in response to requests from the Minister and at their own initiative. This advice has been informed by the diverse experience and expertise of the Board and Council members and their consultations with the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there was a need to change some aspects of the structure and functions. When  the Government's response to the review was tabled in June last year the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, indicated that the Government  would be moving some amendments to the legislation to take account of the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move now to the major provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When NBEET was established the specialist Councils focused on the areas where the Government had the most need of independent advice. They were: schools, higher education, employment and skills formation, and research. Those areas continue to be fundamentally important but since NBEET was established the need has emerged for particular attention to be paid to policy development in two areas of importance across the education sectors. Those areas are language and literacy and international education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the White Paper Australia's Language: The Australian Language and Literacy Policy was released in 1991 it included provision for the establishment of the Australian Language and Literacy Council. The Council has been informally operating as a committee of NBEET under section 36 of the act since late in 1991. The Government now proposes that its status be formalised as a Council established under section 23 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy significance of internationalisation of education and the need for NBEET to address its implications have been recognised by the Government and were endorsed by Professor Wiltshire. To fill this gap, the Government announced the establishment of the Australian International Education Foundation Council in December 1993. As an interim measure the Australian International Education Foundation Council has been operating as a committee of NBEET pending amendment of the legislation. The primary purpose of the Council is to promote and market Australian education and training services. As part of this, the Council will also seek to develop international education, training and research collaboration opportunities for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to create these two new Councils through legislation has highlighted the need to streamline the mechanisms for creating new Councils as the need arises. The bill, therefore, provides for creation of new Councils by disallowable instrument. However, to preserve the integrity and independence of Councils once they are established they can still be abolished only by legislative amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other major element of NBEET encompassed by the review was the Commonwealth/State Consultative Committee. The Committee was intended to inform and advise the Board and its Councils on matters relating to Commonwealth, State and Territory policies and priorities in the fields of employment, education and training and research. Experience has shown that it has become redundant and should be abolished. The Committee met only twice and the Commonwealth and States have not sought to reactivate it since its last meeting in 1989. The Commonwealth and the States and Territories have found it more useful to exchange views in ministerial forums such as the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs and the Australian National Training Authority Ministerial Council. Moreover, it has been a feature of NBEET and its Councils that they have consulted closely with the States and Territories when preparing advice. Input from the States and Territories has, therefore, informed the advice which NBEET has presented to the Government. The amendments to the legislation will abolish the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions of the Board have been expanded to include the functions of the new Councils. The review suggested that NBEET needed to give more attention to issues which cut across the education and training sectors and recommended that Taskforces be established for this purpose. While agreeing that cross sectoral issues are important, the Government's response to the review stated that these matters could be addressed adequately by the Board, drawing on the expertise of its constituent Councils as required. For this reason, it has not been necessary to include in the current amendments any changes to NBEET's structure or operations to respond to this aspect of the review's findings. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has given NBEET some new references on cross sectoral issues to provide a focus for the Board's work in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the review's broad conclusions on the importance of cross-sectoral issues but does not agree that a cumbersome administrative framework is needed. Cross-sectoral matters should continue to be the responsibility of the Board itself drawing on the sectoral expertise of Council members and others as necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments go to administrative matters including to streamline the appointment mechanisms and to allow for acting appointments of Council Chairs and Deputy Chairs during temporary absences of the occupants of these positions. There are also transitional provisions to provide for continuity of membership of the Board and Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of the bill will be minimal. Both new Councils are operating as committees and any costs will be absorbed within the current operating cost structure of NBEET.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FAMILY LAW REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill makes amendments to a number of Commonwealth Acts as a consequence of the enactment of the Family Law Reform Bill 1994. The Family Law Reform Bill 1994 makes substantial changes to the Family Law Act 1975, in particular, it repeals and substitutes Part VII which establishes the relationships between children and their parents. The Reform Package as a whole seeks  to change the approach taken by parents towards their children and emphasises the concept of parental responsibility for the care, welfare and development of their children rather than the current concepts of guardianship, custody and access which are typified by  notions  of ownership of children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of Acts administered by other portfolios have as their foundation, or as a part of their foundation, the outmoded concepts of guardianship custody and access which need to be replaced. The Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Act 1995 gives effect to these changes in the terminology in other Commonwealth legislation.  It will bring other Commonwealth legislation in line with the reforms and facilitate the operation of the associated legislation applying the new concepts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terminology has been amended in the following legislation:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 will amend 12 acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio. It will also amend 2 acts within the responsibilities of the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. They are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (AAT Act) will establish a `Small Taxation Claims Tribunal' within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). Rather than creating a separate structure, the Taxation Appeals Division of the AAT will be known as the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal when it is exercising powers under the new Part IIIAA of the AAT Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal provide a cheaper and less  formal means of resolving disputes between the small taxpayer and the Commissioner of Taxation. There will be an emphasis on mediation as a form of dispute resolution. As part of the current AAT structure, it will also be able to draw on the resources and expertise of the Taxation Appeals Division, and the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal will be able to exercise all the powers of the AAT and that Division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relevant amount of tax in dispute, which will determine whether a matter is heard in accordance with the new Part IIIAA, will be $5,000 unless a higher amount is set, some time in the future, by the regulations. Matters must involve less than the determined amount to be heard by the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. The non-refundable filing fee for small claims matters will be $50 but the tribunal will still be able to waive this fee in cases of hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the AAT Act provides that the Treasurer is to be consulted on proposed appointments to the Taxation Appeals Division. It has been decided that a full consultation requirement is now unnecessary. The amendments to the AAT Act will therefore provide that the Treasurer is now only to be notified of proposed appointments to the Taxation Appeals Division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the AAT Act will provide the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with a discretion to award costs against a party or a party's representative whose conduct of a case is such as to deliberately cause the other party to incur additional costs which would not otherwise have been incurred. This provision echoes provisions already applying to proceedings in the High Court and the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to award costs where there has been an abuse of process is not directed at unrepresented litigants who, because of their unfamiliarity with Tribunal procedures, may cause delays. It is aimed at those parties, or their representatives, who deliberately use the procedures of the Tribunal to their own advantage and thereby cause the other party to incur unnecessary costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the AAT Act will also provide a new mechanism for determining costs where the Tribunal awards costs against a party or a representative of a party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the AAT Act will remove gender-specific language in a number of sections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Family Law Act 1975 will be amended to provide for the conferral of jurisdiction so that either the Federal or Family Court can handle all aspects of a case where the bankruptcy of one spouse affects the family law entitlements of the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Either Court will be able to transfer a case to the other Court where it is more appropriate for the other Court to hear the matter, or it is otherwise in the interests of justice for the other Court to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also provide that prior to the distribution of the estate of the bankrupt to the creditors the non-bankrupt spouse be able to retrieve from the assets of the bankrupt any property he or she may be entitled to under a Family Law Act order or declaration. This will recognise both direct and indirect contributions made by a spouse of a bankrupt towards the acquisition, conservation or improvement of the property and towards non-economic contributions made to the welfare of the family as a whole. It should help to ensure that family law property claims are not defeated by bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976  and the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 will provide a mechanism for establishing an applicable rate of exchange in relation to the registration of foreign judgments. The amendments to section 32W of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976  make provision specifying the method of conversion of New Zealand currency into Australian currency with respect to the enforcement of certain New Zealand judgments. The amendments to section 6 of the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 make provision specifying the method of conversion of foreign currency into Australian currency with respect to the enforcement of certain foreign judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The day on which the rate of exchange is to be established has also been changed. It was the day of the application for registration of the judgment. It will be the second business day before the day on which the application for registration of the judgment is made. This is necessary to enable the judgment creditor time to obtain the necessary evidence from authorised foreign exchange dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) will be amended to include the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Department of Administrative Services in Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act in relation to documents in respect of their commercial activities with the result that those documents may not be obtained under the FOI Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Indigenous Land Corporation will be included in Division 1 of Part II of Schedule 2 with the result that those documents will also not be subject to the Information Privacy Principles contained in section 14 of the Privacy Act 1988 or the performance of the Privacy Commissioner's functions under section 27 of the act. However, the Corporation will still have to comply with the Tax File Number Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Administrative Services will be included in Division 2 of Part II of Schedule 2. Inclusion in that Division does not affect the operation of the Privacy Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Judges' Pensions Act 1968 will be amended to provide that a retired federal judge is entitled to receive the federal judicial pension and hold judicial office in relation to a Territory, provided that the judicial office is not remunerated on a full-time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 will be amended to provide that the act will apply to the Australian Capital Territory on the same basis as it applies to the States and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Act 1988 will be amended to give the Privacy Commissioner the power to determine that an agency is to be a credit provider for the purposes of the act. This amendment is intended to deal with the situation where an agency provides credit on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will also allow a credit reporting agency to list an overdue payment under a guarantee on the guarantor's credit information file. This will only be permitted where the credit provider has first satisfied several conditions, including notifying the guarantor and allowing him or her a 60 day period to make the payment, as well as taking steps to recover the amount of the payment. For this purpose, the bill also inserts in the act a definition of the term `guarantee'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will clarify the Privacy Commissioner's powers in relation to the copying and retention of documents produced to him or her under section 44 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992. The States and Territories were consulted about these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two amendments correct drafting omissions. Other amendments take account of the use of bail justices in Victoria; align the period for entering an appearance to an originating process served interstate more closely with the period applying when an originating process is served within the State of issue; and simplify the procedures applying in some cases where a person who is under a restraint on his or her movements is arrested under an interstate warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, an amendment inserts a new section 86A, to overturn the effect of a 1994 decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia and to reinforce the intention of Parliament as set out in the act in relation to return of persons arrested under an interstate warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clear policy of the act, as set out in section 83, is that a person who is arrested under a valid interstate warrant must return, or be extradited, to the State which issued the warrant. In Lavelle v Commissioner of Police, a judge of the Supreme Court of Western Australia held that the Supreme Court could, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, stay proceedings for extradition of a person from Western Australia to Victoria to face serious criminal charges, despite the fact that under the act extradition is mandatory. The new section 86A makes it clear that a magistrate's order that a person be extradited under the act can only be reviewed under section 86 of the act and that the order cannot be affected by the exercise of any powers except those conferred on Supreme Courts by section 86.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Superannuation Act 1976 will widen the pool of Administrative Appeals Tribunal members who are eligible to hear applications for review of decisions made under the Superannuation Act 1976. It will extend the requirement that at least one member hearing an application for review be an eligible member or pensioner under the 1976 scheme to include a member who is a member or pensioner of the scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Administration Act 1953 will be amended consequentially upon the establishment of the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. It will also provide that the hearings of taxation matters in the AAT will be in private where a taxpayer so requests, except if the matter is being heard in the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal. In small taxation claims matters the normal AAT provisions will apply, so that a hearing will be in public unless the tribunal is satisfied that it should be in private.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Federal Proceedings (Costs) Act 1981 will correct minor drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OVERSEAS MISSIONS (PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill is intended to allow privileges and immunities to be conferred upon the premises of, and persons associated with certain overseas missions in Australia which represent self governing or autonomous foreign territories that are not states and are not recognised by Australia as states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed legislation seeks to accommodate the changing political climate within our region, in which sovereign states are no longer the only players. Self governing or autonomous foreign territories which are not states and which Australia does not recognise as states, such as Hong Kong, New Caledonia and the Cook Islands, are increasingly taking part in the economic and trade affairs of the region in their own right. This legislation seeks to provide a window of opportunity for such territories to establish official representation in Australia for the purposes of promoting bilateral trade and performing a liaison function regarding multilateral trade, and economic issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, privileges and immunities are afforded to diplomatic and consular missions and their staff in Australia. This is done by virtue of the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967, and the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1972 respectively which reflect the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations. Also, the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 affords privileges and immunities to international organisations and their staff where they establish a mission in Australia. The current legislation is deficient, however, in that it does not afford privileges and immunities to missions which do not represent sovereign states or international organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill therefore flows from Australia's existing obligations under international law which relate to diplomatic and consular missions. It is further intended to fill the existing gap in legislation regarding missions from self governing or autonomous entities. The privileges and immunities afforded under the legislation would protect the operations of the mission&mdash;thus assisting in the effective performance of their functions. I stress that the purpose of providing privileges and immunities is to facilitate the effective and unhindered operations of the missions. They are not intended for the benefit of individuals but are accorded solely in the interests of the mission, to enable it to perform its functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to come within the scope of the Bill two conditions must be met. Firstly, the mission must be declared by regulation to be a "designated overseas mission"; and secondly, the mission must be authorised to operate within certain capacities as set out in a written instrument signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These conditions would also be subject to the agreement of the Government, in consultation with others concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly however, the Bill is not intended to cover missions in Australia representing purely political entities such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or purely commercial entities such as Hutt River Province.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The form and operation of the Bill is modelled on the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, in so far as the Bill provides the framework and criteria within which privileges and immunities are set out and may be accorded. The Bill itself would be given effect by the regulations made under it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedules to the Bill set out a broad range of privileges and immunities of possible application to designated overseas missions. They represent the upper limit, so to speak, of the privileges and immunities which might be conferred upon the premises of a designated overseas mission and the persons associated with it. The privileges and immunities listed are along the lines of those conferred by the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations. However, under no circumstances would a designated overseas mission or any person associated with it be entitled to privileges and immunities which go beyond those conferred by the Vienna Conventions upon diplomatic or consular missions and their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be possible for th~ regulations to confer upon designated overseas missions any or all of the privileges and immunities listed, either unconditionally or subject to limitations or conditions. They would be specifically tailored to provide a precise and comprehensive account of the privileges and immunities applicable in each case. The use of the regulations in this way is consistent with the precedent already set by the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act. Furthermore, they maintain flexibility within the legislation and allow the government to limit or qualify the application of privileges and immunities on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that the first occasion for the application of the legislation would arise in the context of the proposed establishment of a Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Sydney in the second half of 1995. A Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office would cover bilateral commercial relations between Hong Kong and Australia and conduct a liaison function where multilateral trade issues, including WTO and APEC, are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application of the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill may result in a loss of revenue at both the Commonwealth and State or Territory levels due to certain privileges of a financial nature which could be accorded to the premises of a designated overseas mission and persons associated with that mission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The privileges which could be accorded include exemptions from taxation levied directly against the mission regarding its property, and personal exemptions from taxation for persons associated with the mission. It is preferable to allow for the possibility of such exemptions from taxation in order to maintain consistency with the application of privileges under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations, and to enable missions to operate effectively within Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to speculate lt this stage on the possible losses to be incurred. Any losses to revenue would be determined by the number of missions which are entitled to financial privileges under the legislation, and the extent of the privileges accorded to such missions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, any loss in revenue would be far outweighed by the potential for economic gain which the presence and operations of such missions would incur. The missions would boost Australia's bilateral trade interests, and provide greater scope for Australia regarding multilateral trade opportunities within the region. Furthermore, the Bill would create a basis for the reciprocal extension of privileges and immunities, enabling the Australian Government to reduce the costs of Australian offices in the territory represented by the designated overseas mission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill seeks to provide a framework to enable privileges and immunities to be conferred on overseas missions in Australia and their staff. It is an adaptation of fundamental principles of international law to the reality of our regional environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OVERSEAS MISSIONS (PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill is intended to make consequential amendments to Commonwealth Acts which will enable the effective implementation of the Principal Bill, that is, the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As has been noted already today, the Principal Bill allows privileges and immunities to be accorded to missions representing self governing or autonomous foreign territories in Australia and their staff. It flows from existing legislation which accords privileges and immunities to diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations in Australia, and their staff. However, the intention of the Principal Bill is to adapt this existing legislation to the realities of our changing economic regional climate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to ensure the effective implementation of the Principal Bill, the Consequential Amendments Bill would make amendments to a number of Commonwealth Acts. In particular, amendments would be made to the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act 1978 and the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property Act 1971.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly speaking, these Acts provide protection to the premises of, and persons associated with diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations. The Consequential Amendments Bill would extend their scope to provide appropriate protection to the premises of missions established under the Principal Bill, and their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Protective Service Act establishes the Australian Protective Service and sets out its functions which include, among other things, the protection of property in which a foreign country or an international organisation has an interest. The functions of the Australian Protective Service also include the protection of internationally protected persons. The Consequential Amendments Bill would extend this Act to protect property in which a mission established in accordance with the Principal Bill has an interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act enacts into Australia's domestic law the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents. Under the Act, as it presently stands, the Governor-General may make regulations declaring persons, who are not specifically mentioned in the Convention, to be "internationally protected persons"&mdash;for example, persons associated with international organisations. The Consequential Amendments Bill would expand the application of the Act and allow the Governor-General to make regulations declaring certain persons associated with missions established under the Principal Bill to be "internationally protected persons" and afforded protection as such.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act prohibits the improper use of diplomatic and consular signs and titles which falsely purport to represent a diplomatic or consular</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">mission. The Consequential Amendments Bill would expand the protection afforded by the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act to cover missions established under the Principal Bill. It would also ensure that the authorised activities of a mission established under the Principal Bill would not amount to prohibited activities in so far as they may overlap with activities carried out by diplomatic and consular missions, and vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act enacts into domestic law Australia's international obligations to preserve public order in respect of the premises and personnel of diplomatic and consular missions and international organisations. The Consequential Amendments Bill would extend protection under that Act to missions established under the Principal Bill, consistent with these existing international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment of the Australian Protective Service Act, expanding the functions of the Australian Protective Service to cover missions established under the Principal Bill and to certain persons associated with it, may require an increase in the resources devoted to the service. The amount of such an increase is not quantifiable at this stage, and will depend on the number of missions requiring such protection. However, I emphasise that the economic gain which would result from the presence and operations of the missions given privileges and immunities under the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Bill would outweigh the costs of extending the protective service to those missions. The other amendments would have no financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To conclude, the Consequential Amendments Bill would facilitate the effective implementation of the Overseas Mission (Privileges and Immunities) Bill. The consequential amendments would extend protections afforded by existing legislation to missions and their staff established under the Principal Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is to amend the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983, the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952, the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965 and the Public Service Act 1922. Details of the various amendments are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanies the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill implements the decision of the Government which was announced in August 1994 to abolish the Economic Planning Advisory Council (the Council) and establish in its place an Economic Planning Advisory Commission (the Commission).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Government established the Council in 1983, there was a clear need to improve consultation between business, trade unions, community groups and government on economic issues. Over the past decade, EPAC has contributed substantially to promoting a broader understanding of Australia's medium and long-term economic and social prospects and consultation is now much more widespread than in the early eighties. The need for a body like the Council has diminished accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government now intends to build on the Council's achievements by establishing the new Commission. The new Commission will assume the role of the Office of EPAC, rather than that of the Council itself. Its public information role will be expanded and its new functions will allow it to focus more directly on the provision of advice to Government on medium to long-term social and economic issues. The Commission will also have an expanded capacity to undertake special projects, such as the major National Strategies Conference "Shaping Our Future" held in November 1994, and to undertake task force work on particular issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendments to the Public Service Act will achieve two aims. As Honourable Senators are aware, the annual reports of Commonwealth Departments and Budget-funded agencies are a most important element in the overall accountability process. The Public Service Act annual reports to be prepared in accordance with guidelines approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA). In March 1994, the JCPA endorsed revised guidelines which require annual reports to be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament by 31 October each year. The amendments to the Public Service Act will require Secretaries to furnish their annual reports to Ministers no later than 15 October. In turn, Ministers will be required to table the reports in each House on or before 31 October each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that a Secretary considers that the Department's annual report cannot be given to the Minister by 15 October, the amendments will allow the Minister to grant an extension of time. However, if the Minister forms the opinion that the report cannot be tabled by 31 October, he or she will be required to advise the Parliament before that date of the reasons for the delay and the date by which the report will be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes special arrangements for the tabling of annual reports when Parliament is not sitting on 31 October in a particular year and a House does not allow papers to be tabled out of session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will apply to annual reports for the 1995-96 financial year and subsequent years. However, in keeping with the arrangements which were put in place for last year's annual reports, Ministers will be expected to table their Departments' annual reports by 31 October this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the other amendments to the Public Service Act which the Bill contains will facilitate personnel management in the Parliamentary Departments. Under the present arrangements, many of the powers of the Public Service Commissioner are conferred on the Presiding  Officers in relation to the staff of the Parliamentary Departments. However, the Act does not contain any provision which allows the Presiding Officers to delegate those powers to officers in their Departments. They may not, for instance, delegate their power to appoint and promote staff, to create and abolish positions and raise or lower classifications. This lack of a power to delegate means that the Presiding Officers are required to perform routine personnel management functions which are performed in other Departments at relatively junior levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments would allow the Presiding Officers to delegate any or all of their personnel management powers, except the power to recommend certain matters to Governor-General. The amendments would also confer on the Presiding Officers powers, similar to those enjoyed by Secretaries of Commonwealth Departments, in relation to the cancellation of promotions and the approval of promotions following a Joint Selection Committee process. They would also allow the Merit Protection and Review Agency, which currently has no jurisdiction in relation to the Parliamentary Departments, to review promotions at or above the Senior Officer Grade C classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, Honourable Senators will recall that, following the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure in February 1994, the Committee of the Whole House was abolished and, consequently, the title of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees was changed to "Deputy Speaker". The Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act currently defines the term "Deputy Presiding Officer" in relation to the House of Representatives to mean the "Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees". The Bill includes an amendment to correct the reference to the Deputy Speaker's title. The Bill also amends the Parliamentary Allowances Act, which is administered by the Minister for Administrative Services, to correct the references to the titles of the Deputy President and Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker in that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRANSPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill amends four Acts. Some of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent fine tuning and clarification of statutory provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will not deal with the minor technical amendments in this speech, but instead will focus on the significant amendments contained in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two notable sets of amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920. Firstly, an amendment to section 27 which will extend the potential extra-territorial reach of regulations made under the Act; and secondly a package of amendments relating to the security of civil aviation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 1 November 1994,  Australia entered into a treaty with the United States and Canada which requires each country to ban smoking on all passenger flights operated by its airlines between points in the territory of one party to the treaty and points in the territory of another party (excluding flights operated via an intermediate point in the territory of a state which is not a party to the treaty).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement came into effect on 1 March 1995 and regulations were made before this date to allow Australia to give effect to its international obligations under this treaty. The Government has decided to extend these smoking bans to apply to all international flights operated by Australian airlines from 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presently, there is no power to make regulations banning smoking on foreign registered aircraft operated by an Australian carrier outside Australian territory. Amendments to section 27 of the Air Navigation Act will ensure the application of such regulations in those cases where foreign registered aircraft are operated by Australian carriers overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second set of amendments to the Air Navigation Act transfer a number of aviation security standards, currently contained in the Air Navigation Regulations, to the Act. Increased penalties for failure to comply with aviation security measures are, in most cases, also being introduced which reflect the gravity of the offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the penalties for breaches of aviation security offences in the Air Navigation Regulations are general and minimal. The amendments provide revised penalty levels tailored to each offence. The revised penalties set by these amendments impose a maximum term of imprisonment of 7 years in the case of a breach by an individual and a maximum fine of $100,000 in the case of a breach by a corporation in the case of the most serious offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aviation security standards encapsulated in these amendments cover a range of measures promoting secure air services within Australia. The standards include the screening of airline passengers, procedures for the security of airline baggage, the reporting of threats or incidents of unlawful interference with aviation and prohibitions against the carriage of weapons in aircraft and sensitive areas of airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments include a number of offences that are designed to detect, deter and prevent instances of unlawful interference with aircraft, such as the hijack or the destruction of an aircraft and its passengers by terrorists. By revising penalty levels, these amendments to the Air Navigation Act set clear and enhanced incentives for companies and individuals to comply with Australia's aviation security requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 to make it mandatory for air operators to be insured against liabilities for death or injury caused to passengers carried under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments represent an important component of the Government's response to the Monarch Airlines crash. That response, announced by the Minister for Transport in October 1994, included increases in passenger carriers' liability limits, as well as the introduction of mandatory insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new domestic passenger carriers' liability limit of $500,000 per passenger took effect in October 1994. The Government has subsequently introduced legislation to increase the limit for Australia's international carriers to the equivalent amount of 260,000 Special Drawing Rights. Foreign airlines serving Australia have been asked to adopt this higher limit on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction of mandatory insurance is an important complement to the increase in carriers' liability limits. No operator will be allowed to carry passengers for hire or reward without appropriate insurance cover. It will be an offence for an operator to carry passengers without such cover. In the case of domestic carriage, the minimum insurance level is $500,000 per passenger. International carriers, including foreign carriers serving Australia, will be required to provide evidence that they are insured to a level of 260,000 Special Drawing Rights per passenger.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, mandatory insurance provisions greatly reduce the scope for insurers to avoid paying compensation in respect of passengers who are killed or injured. For example, insurers will not be able to avoid payment because of a breach of an aviation safety requirement by an operator. These `non-voidability' provisions have been closely modelled on arrangements already applying in the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides authority for the Minister for Transport to require operators to provide evidence of compliance with the insurance requirements. This authority will be delegated to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which will be responsible for administration of the new arrangements. The Bill gives the Minister the power to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction to prevent a carrier which is reasonably believed not to hold insurance from operating a passenger service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides authority for regulations to be made covering a range of important administrative matters such as what constitutes acceptable insurance, and the manner and form in which evidence of insurance must be provided.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994, which is currently before the parliament, is the first part of a rewrite of the Income Tax Assessment Act in plain English. Unfortunately, it has a very narrow focus that is directed only to work related expenses. In fact, it does no more than prescribe very tight conditions&mdash;they are unreasonably tight in some circumstances&mdash;for tax deductibility. They are not for business generally but for taxpayers incurring expenses relating to their work and claiming tax deductions for car expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the time it has taken to get this first instalment of a very large program, I query the team's ability to complete the task on schedule. An interesting observation is that the section of the population that really knows the least about tax and tax implications when compared with business will, as a result of this legislation, now have standards and conditions put on it that are very tight compared with business, which generally has money to access tax advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate to remember the Evangelist case, because we could see it being well repeated. For those who do not remember it, the Evangelist case went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which was satisfied that an expense had been incurred. But the very prescriptive nature of signing off each day's expenditure or mileage had not been followed, so the expenditure claim was denied. So I am very concerned about the ability of people to be successful in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us shows inconsistencies between different types of taxpayers. The substantiation requirements are quite different, for example, for taxpayers who have expenses related to an award where they do not have to follow this prescription and they do not have to provide any written evidence. The problem is that the work related prescriptions are very tight compared with those for general business purposes. There are inconsistencies in that those people under an award can claim a deduction without any written prescription whereas others have to comply with the detailed letter of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who are most at risk under this legislation are politicians. They are most at risk because of the nature of their expenditure patterns and, in many cases, their inability to get a prescriptive ticket. Those who go to a show pay $10 to go through the gate. The ticket is passed in, so there is no record of expenditure. One might say that one can claim up to $200 in this way, but $200 is eaten up very quickly. I ask the minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to ensure that this $200 is lifted. We cannot do this as an opposition, because it has revenue implications. But in consideration of the needs of her back bench and others, I ask her to listen very carefully in terms of that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years, our Income Tax Assessment Act has been criticised for its complexity, language and length. This difficulty has led to unnecessary high compliance costs for taxpayers and increased administration costs to the government. In recent times, the government has been transferring many of those costs back to the business community and, in the case of this bill, to ordinary taxpayers. There has also been the problem of inaccurate compliance by taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very persuasive report No. 326 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>, which is a report on an inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was a part, recommended that the government establish a broadly based task force for redrafting the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and that the government commit sufficient resources to the task that would allow it to complete a priority simplification redraft within two years and full simplification of the act within five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project team has released a broad framework. It makes it clear that the project is not about reforming the tax system or reviewing tax policy. That in itself is a major disappointment. Its narrow objective is to focus on administrative rules that the Australian Taxation Office believes are overly complex, unnecessary or out of date with today's reality. That is an interesting statement, because these rules only came in less than seven years ago and they are alleged to be already out of date. However, the framework made clear that, when redrafting, the project team may come across provisions where the meaning is unclear. These cases may require the government to clarify the policy so that the law can be more clearly written. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed to complement the tax law improvement project is for a commission to be set up to tackle the major technical issues inherent in the Income Tax Assessment Act. This is precisely what this improvement team is not doing. My approach is to look at the technical issues that are inherent in, and scattered right throughout, the Income Tax Assessment Act. Therein lies the problem. I believe that such a concentration of effort would concrete the future of Australia's taxation laws in the direction of a simpler legislative framework and not necessarily a plain English simplified version. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, the first instalment, naturally has been reasonably welcomed. But, given the opportunity for time, more and more people are having concerns about its content and its scope. It was hoped to be a promising micro-economic reform at the call of the Australian economy. However, any reform is a slow and arduous project. I believe that there are major difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that the project team is in capable hands. In fact, it is being led by Brian Nolan, a former second commissioner in the Australian Taxation Office who has spent more than 20 years making tax laws more complicated. He is adamant now in his near retirement years of trying to help to tidy them up. Perhaps we might need some older people in the Taxation Office who share Brian Nolan's enthusiasm. The team also includes personnel from the Australian Taxation Office, the Treasury, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and two private sector representatives. A 14-person consultative committee has also been set up, and I think there are one or two other people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that the project has been based on the lessons of the wholesale sales tax, the New Zealand income tax simplification and the Australian Corporations Law simplification. As the minister may recall, this afternoon I drew attention to a particular problem arising from sales tax simplification. But the task of rewriting the wholesale sales tax will be a large project for the drafters and their advisers, as the project life is estimated to be two to three years. This might seem a long time until one realises how much time will be needed to check the changes at the stage of the exposure draft bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first law to be brought out by the tax law improvement program. The aim is to try to make some significant savings in the cost of compliance by expressing the law in simpler and easier to understand language, and as such we welcome that. The substantiation requirements, as outlined in sections 82KT and 82KZBB, require substantiation of car expenses claimed by individuals and partnerships and substantiation of employment related expenses for salary and wage earners. I must emphasise that companies and trusts are excluded from their operation because they come under a different set of rules, principally section 62A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the self-assessment system, the records do not have to be provided with a taxpayer's return but must be retained for production in the case of an audit. While the reworded bill conforms to the stated aims of the project, in that it is better structured and more easily understood, the practical application of the substantiation rules remains extremely complicated and does not deal with any underlying policy issues affecting the complexity of the law. While the changes are important, this process really must go a lot further. I would hope that the tax law improvement team take note of these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute of Australia also expresses shortcomings about the tax law improvement process. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is acknowledged that a move to have a simpler legislative framework with a less legalistic structure is clearly the preferred approach to the future direction of tax laws. However, the change in language used in the legislation is not of itself sufficient to materially reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers in complying with the substantiation provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>After hearing those comments from that influential body, what have we really achieved? The government certainly has achieved a public relations plus but, in the long term, when more and more people come to realise the tight prescriptive nature of this, I think it will turn into not a plus but a minus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the opinion that the project will take a lot longer than the scheduled two to three years. I believe this whole process can be put into the context of a person on a three-week holiday. During this time, this person plans to paint the house, the gates and the surrounding fence. But, at the end of the first week, that person has done no more than, say, paint the front gate. This is the stage that we have got to in terms of the two- to three-year time frame set for the tax law improvement project. They have only brushed over the topics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that in future we will see amendments that will amalgamate generic groupings like capital allowances and that will establish a basic framework for treating like items. This, in turn, will be followed by draft rewrites for specific areas such as mining, petroleum and quarrying activities, general depreciation and tax losses. But this is not without its problems. Concern has been raised that depreciation and tax loss issues are being reviewed by the tax office as a result of contentious draft rulings; for example, TR94/D26 and D42. A solution has been suggested that the review of the current law and its underlying policy be completed before the relevant rewrite is progressed. Without this, I can assure you there will be longer debates, there will be more changes and it will just defeat the purpose for which the tax law improvement process has been set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without business insistence, the tax law improvement project will only be about form and not about substance. The major shortcoming of the project has been the narrowness of the review. The Treasurer has limited the scope of the redrafting by only specifying a commitment to plainer language, improved presentation and using the most modern drafting techniques and styles that are available. He talked of rational and sensible use of definitions. The tax office and the team have done quite a good job in terms of what has been required, given the very limited scope under which they could operate. I give a bouquet to the tax office and to Mr Nolan and his advisers and assistants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nutshell, the substantiation provisions cover a number of issues. Unfortunately, my time does not permit me to go through them. We will certainly address them in the committee stage. Most measures should in some way reduce compliance costs, but there will be increased compliance costs for individual business persons who, for example, take short-term domestic travel of one to five nights. Presently, they are not required to maintain any records, but the bill will require them to obtain written evidence. Also, salary and wage earners must now retain their records for five years instead of three and a half years. This will be a burden for taxpayers. I will address this further during the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ray Regan, a well-known commentator from the National Tax and Accounting Association, notes that it is becoming abundantly clear that our taxation system creates a far more onerous record keeping regime on individuals than for businesses. Coming from a man with such experience, whose membership is drawn basically from the smaller practitioners, this is a serious statement. It is one that needs serious consideration by the Senate and the government. It places a heavy burden on untrained individuals to comply with the double jeopardy of nexus; that is, that the taxpayer actually incurred the expense and it was directly relevant to their current income activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act also superimposes burdensome substantiation guidelines which do not even apply to businesses, knowing full well that suppliers of goods and services have no obligation to in any way provide receipts in the required format. Is it any wonder that most individuals look upon the substantiation legislation as being deemed guilty until they can prove their innocence under substantiation? I put to you that the very process intimidates most individuals. At the very least it will be very costly. In nearly all cases, people will have to go to accountants to get the commissioner's discretion. It will usually be as the result of an audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth stressing that over the last eight years primary audits on individual taxpayers consistently indicate that at least seven out of 10 individual taxpayers make errors in their returns, having to pay back not less than $1,200 each after the audit. Our taxation laws are placing a far greater responsibility on ordinary taxpayers not trained on financial matters. As indicated, they are more likely to make technical errors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is rather anxious to get this through. I wonder why. Is not the government expecting to raise an extra $1 billion from tighter compliance, tighter substantiation? How did this come about? In the last budget the government thought it could get an extra $300 million, but in the previous budget it highlighted the fact that it was going to get $750 million. Where is all this money going to come from? It must come from ordinary individuals, individuals who may have problems with substantiation. Are these a targeted group? Are politicians a targeted group? I certainly hope not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our tax laws are placing far greater responsibility on these ordinary taxpayers, who are more likely to make technical errors. But at this early stage of the proceedings a spanner has been thrown into the works as a result of a recent decision in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal concerning a long distance truck driver's expenses on food and drink. You might recall that the driver thought he was complying with the substantiation rules by keeping a logbook. Even though the logbook is not an acceptable method by which to claim expenditure, the tribunal decided to exercise its statutory discretion. It was satisfied the expenses had been incurred and that it would be unreasonable for the substantiation provisions to apply to this taxpayer. Consequently the taxpayer was allowed a deduction of $6,240 for travel expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the minister to respond to the question: how is this decision going to impinge on this legislation? I think we need to answer that. It was a good decision of the tribunal but it has thrown in doubt this whole question of the credibility of these new substantiation rules that we are about to pass. Obviously the simple answer that I know they are going to give is that this applied to the previous law and not to the current law. But this has raised the sorts of issues that this legislation is designed to overcome. In essence on the approach taken by the tribunal in this case, the commissioner ought not to apply a full substantiation under the current rules if a taxpayer can provide evidence that expense was incurred and the circumstances are such that the taxpayer would otherwise be entitled to a deduction. The effect of this tribunal's decision when combined with the proposed change to be made to the law has created a degree of uncertainty about the extent to which there must be compliance with the peculiar and detailed substantiation rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further problems are associated with the rewrite of this bill. Section 16-3(1) underlines a fundamental flaw. My colleague Mr Rocher in the other house drew attention to the concept of a person flying to Los Angeles for the sole purpose of attending a seven-day a conference, but if you do not record the conference on your travel record you cannot deduct the cost of the air fare. This is so even if you have written evidence that you have paid for the fare or a receipt is required by division 5. If that is correct, that is a major problem people are going to face.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further to our telephone conversation of last week about an aspect of the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994, I thought that it might be of further assistance if I explained how the substantiation provisions would apply to the fact scenario which you were concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You asked how the written evidence rules would apply to a taxpayer who purchases goods from someone who does not normally provide a receipt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substantiation is only required for expenses incurred in the production of salary or wages, or, for individual taxpayers and partnerships containing at least one individual taxpayer, for business travel expenses and for car expenses where the one-third of expenses method or the log book method is used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislation contains specific provisions which deal with situations where either the supplier is a person carrying on a business who does not, in the ordinary course of the business, supply a receipt, invoice or similar document, and situations where, the person who supplies the goods does so other than in the course of a business. In these situations, satisfactory evidence includes a statement or certificate supplied by the person who supplied the goods. I refer you to subsections 82KU(3) and (4) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tax Law Improvement Project considered that the law could be simplified by allowing a broader range of documentation in all cases, rather than just in these limited situations. Thus the term "receipt, invoice or similar document" has been replaced with the wider term "document". I refer you to the explanation of this change on page 33 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hence it is not necessary for the supplier of the goods to use a formal or printed document to evidence the purchase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, if the supplier would not normally provide any form of documentation for a receipt, there are two provisions in the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill which could assist the purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, under sections 5.6 and 5.7, if the Commissioner considers it unreasonable to expect you to have gotten written evidence of an expense, you can rely on a record of the expenses which you have made yourself instead of getting a document from the supplier. This record does not necessarily have to be a diary entry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, section 8.1, allows a deduction in cases where the formal requirements have not been met, if, on the basis of the nature and quality of the evidence that the purchaser has to substantiate their claim, the Commissioner is satisfied that the purchaser incurred the expense and is entitled to a deduction. The Bill broadens the discretion in the existing law, which limits the situations in which the discretion may be applied. The Bill will remove those restrictions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is the first effort of the tax law improvement rewrite project of the Tax Office. The Democrats welcome this program and support the rewriting of the Income Tax Assessment Act in plain English. The bill runs to 31 pages across two schedules and will replace sections 82KT to 82KZBB inclusive. In the process the bulk of the text dealing with the substantiation provisions of the tax act is reduced by 50 per cent. The tax law improvement project arose out of a representation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report tabled in December 1993. The then federal Treasurer John Dawkins took up the recommendation, announced a rewrite of the tax act and then promptly resigned from parliament two hours later. It has now taken a year for this part of the review to be completed, with three even more complex phases yet to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to commend the project team on some of the results of their endeavours. The wording of the bill is fairly user-friendly and the aim to make the tax act the primary source for assessment advice is largely met. The structure of the bill has been overhauled to make it easier for the users to find their way around it. The language is direct, with the use of the pronoun `you' as the focus point for a taxpayer's obligations. Every section stems from a key principle, with a large amount of explanatory material and the use of graphic illustrations and examples. But a more readable act does not necessarily mean lower compliance costs for taxpayers. The key failing of the review process has been the very narrow terms of reference under which the review team laboured. These terms of reference did not allow the team to consider policy issues, even policy issues directly related to compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping the terms of reference so narrow, the government has continued to ignore the problems that substantiation provisions and self-assessment have caused since their introduction in 1984. The search by the Tax Institute and the National Tax Accountants Association shows that the overwhelming majority of taxpayers whose returns are audited are found to have made errors. There remains a lack of understanding about current tax rules, with taxpayers still denied legitimate deductions even when the expense is documented if the proper form and process has not been followed. This bill does little to improve the situation. Having said that, the government has in a few minor ways moved to improve the current law. Logbook rules for car expenses have been slightly improved. All four forms of car expenses are to be exempted from the $300 substantiation threshold exemption, a move which benefits about 10 per cent of taxpayers claiming car expenses and which the government estimates suggest could cost as much as $10 million in revenue. The requirements for documented travel expenses are standardised for business and non-business users, making diary requirements on short trips a little less onerous for business users but more onerous for ordinary taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules for record retention are standardised, reducing the period that business users must hold receipts from seven to five years but increasing the period for ordinary taxpayers from 3 1/2 to five years. Laundry expenses are simplified, allowing up to $150 of expenses without receipts. The rules on annotating receipts and independent advice payments are relaxed a little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are generally welcomed but they do not go far enough. The substantiation provisions on ordinary taxpayers are still too complex and the compliance costs still far too high. The beneficiaries of the changes are in most instances business taxpayers, and while that is fine, ordinary taxpayers will get little if anything out of the changes other than a more readable but more onerous tax act. This is certainly disappointing. Government has not even been prepared to retain the few concessions available to ordinary taxpayers under the present bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key concern for the Democrats is the reluctance of government to preserve the benefit of the $300 exemption threshold below which substantiation receipts need not be kept. This amount has not been increased since 1986 when the self-assessment and substantiation rules were introduced. It marked a concession from government to small taxpayers and they said at the time, `We are really not after you; we are after the bigger fish.' Since 1986, the CPI has risen nearly 50 per cent, while the figure of $300 has not risen at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were attempting to look at an amendment to raise the amount to $450 but apparently could not persuade either the opposition or the government to agree to it. We do ask questions about whether this government is really serious about a fairer tax system. Let us remember that, according to the 1992-93 taxation statistics, a middle income taxpayer is paying around 28c in the dollar while a millionaire is still paying around 23c in the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that its decision to exempt all four forms of travel expenses from the $300 threshold is a new concession. But, again, this will benefit only business taxpayers. Eighty-eight per cent of taxpayers who claim travel expenses do so using the cents per kilometre or 12 per cent of cost schemes which are not included now in the $300 limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this bill results in a better written law but does nothing for the PAYE taxpayer. There are benefits in there for business taxpayers but none for the mums and dads who continue to provide the vast bulk of revenue for this government. The Democrats will support the bill as a marginal improvement on existing law. However, we would urge the government to seriously reconsider the priority it is giving to ordinary taxpayers in the tax law improvement project, and to ensure that a fairer go for PAYE taxpayers becomes a statement of action rather than another piece of unfulfilled rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the drafting working party and consultative committee consist of lots of representatives of business interests but hardly any voice for PAYE taxpayers. I would urge the government to review this imbalance in representation before the next stage of reform. </PARA>

A new numbering system has also been introduced which has been designed to avoid problems caused by the old system. However, the opposition has noted that there may still be areas of inconvenience in the numbering. Use is made of duplicate section numbers in two new schedules&mdash;for example, section 1-1 of schedule 2A and section 1-1 of schedule 2B. This may create a degree of inconvenience in searching for sections in electronic publications and databases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the opposition totally supports the efforts and progress made in the simplification of the act, the narrowness of the overall review is a major shortcoming. Complex tax policy issues which need to be addressed to achieve a major simplification of the tax system have been totally ignored in this bill, with the emphasis, as it is, on the use of plain English and the adoption of a simple legislative structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, this approach is to be commended, but the opposition believes that the whole approach does not go far enough. Plain English and a better drafting of the law are, themselves, not a substitute for a simpler tax law with lower compliance costs. A simplification of the income tax law is a matter of policy which seems to be lacking from any attempt by the government to address the inherent problems in the current tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the new substantiation provisions will apply to expenses incurred on or after 1 July last year&mdash;that is, 1994. This compares with the original starting date of 1 July 1995, which was specified in the initial exposure draft. The opposition hopes that the Australian Taxation Office has made every effort to ensure that its regular <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> publication makes taxpayers aware of the new rules as they apply to a number of the substantiation provisions in the bill. Certainly, it must be admitted that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> publication has, on a number of occasions over the last few years, contained some significant errors of fact, which have served to create both confusion and concern amongst Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Substantiation provisions of the Income Tax Act are estimated to have an impact on 70 per cent of all taxpayers, with an estimated 5.4 million people being affected. It is imperative, therefore, that the proposed substantiation changes are fully and widely advertised to enable taxpayers to benefit fully from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of this bill is expected to be minimal, with the administrative changes having no impact on revenue. The one exception will be the removal of car expenses from the $300 substantiation threshold exemption. Whilst I do not intend to go into any degree of detail on the changes which this bill introduces, I would like to say that the opposition believes that the changes themselves do not, in some cases, go far enough. We in the opposition believe that the process of income tax law simplification, with the consequential reduction in compliance costs, must go much further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great number of concerns have been raised about this legislation by the National Taxpayers Association of Australia, the NTAA. That association, for example, quite correctly highlights the difficulties created by many of the onerous record keeping requirements which are placed on individuals which are not placed on businesses. Whilst the opposition agrees with this particular area of concern, it would hope that many of the difficulties caused by substantiation requirements can be remedied and resolved by the discretion power placed in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation, under section 8-1 of schedule 2B of the new bill. The opposition also agrees with the criticism by the NTAA that individual taxpayers face a difficulty in substantiation in those cases where a supplier of goods and services is not legally compelled&mdash;under any state or federal provision&mdash;to provide an original receipt, invoice or statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern is the increased period under which taxpayers must retain records; this has increased from three and a half months to five years. Whilst the opposition is broadly in agreement with the standardising of the period for business and individual taxpayers, there must be some concern that individual taxpayers are being burdened with additional retention procedures and the increased likelihood of losing or unintentionally disposing of substantiation receipts. Again, we in the opposition tend to agree with the NTAA that this may have the effect of further burdening taxpayers with additional compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a number of other similar examples, the detail of which I will not go into here. Suffice it to say, however, that the opposition believes that, whilst the rewriting and simplification of the act is to be commended, there is much more that needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time the government has spoken about the need to simplify the taxation system but has done little to further that objective. It is interesting to look back to the 1985 tax summit and recall the words of the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A good tax system should be as simple as possible . . . to reduce the burden of record keeping . . . to increase the certainty of what is, or is not, taxable and to increase the clarity of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>That objective of the Prime Minister's got lost for a while&mdash;five years, in fact&mdash;and finally re-emerged in February 1990 in the form of the statement announcing the establishment of a review team to examine options for the simplification of the tax system. Then, over three years after that, we finally heard of the tax simplification project. Thus, it has taken us more than 10 years to proceed from the Prime Minister's original tax summit statement to the production of this simplification bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not appear to be genuine on the question of tax simplification. Whilst the opposition supports the bill, it acknowledges many of the concerns raised by the tax association. The opposition believes that tax simplification entails much more than rewriting the Income Tax Act in simple English; it requires a concerted and genuine attempt by government to reduce the complexity and to increase the fairness of the overall tax system in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by saying that this is one of the bills that has been pushed through as a matter of urgency because it is considered to be necessary in order to change taxation for this year. I would like to make it very clear that, and I am not sure whether everybody understands this, if we go ahead and pass this bill now or if we go through the full debate&mdash;which I am hoping we will not; I am hoping we will adjourn it&mdash;we will possibly bring in some changes that are problematical. There certainly are elements to this bill which a number of people are looking for, but there are also some possible problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that rushing through with this kind of haste is the best way to deal with this. If we have been waiting ten years, it is not the right thing to do to wait ten years and then put some things through which might create problems&mdash;not just problems now but problems in retrospect because this applies from 1 July 1994. It means that, if there are problems, we are already hoisting them on people for their current tax year when they would not have been aware of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us a bill the government believes must be passed as a matter of urgency&mdash;the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill. It is another of those bills which have been rapidly pushed through the Senate. Treasury said as it presented it to us that it was introduced in the House last year and so, if it was introduced in the Senate in this sitting and debated the next, it would have taken almost a year to pass. That is stretching the truth. In point of fact this bill was introduced in the House last year. It was introduced on 8 December. The House rose on the 9th. It was not read a second time or debated until 8 February&mdash;that is, this sitting. It was introduced in the Senate on 27 February, the beginning of this last week of sitting. I would like to note that, if it went according to standing orders and was passed on the last day of the next sittings, it would have been passed in slightly more than six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to note that when the draft law was circulated the date for the changes was the tax year starting 1 July 1995. The bill was introduced in the House at the very end of last year's sittings with a date making it effective from 1 July 1994. In other words, the government decided to push it through and knew it would have to push it through the Senate against standing orders if it wanted to be certain it would be passed before this year's tax pack was sent to the printers. So the government knew about this before it started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a bill which is intended primarily to clean up the language and vagaries of substantiation law. We were told explicitly that it was intended not as a policy review or to change law but simply to make it comprehensible with a few minor changes to eliminate the totally unreasonable. The vagaries have been with us for a while. If the bill is not intended to address policy questions or the nature of the tax system itself, I cannot understand the panic. The problem with existing law&mdash;aside from being, by their own admission, incomprehensible even to the tax officers who drafted this new bill&mdash;seems to me to be that the substantiation requirements introduced in 1984 and subsequently modified are really over the top, requiring a number of things that no-one is likely to be able to do even if they try. I understand there is broad support for changes to make this system more rational by introducing a bit of flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the principle of consideration and undue haste, I have some substantive concerns. I recognise the attempt to create greater flexibility in relation to the substantiation requirements allowing taxpayers to fill in the blanks that inevitably occur on receipts or to provide some evidence other than a signed receipt from the seller. This may be marginally better than the current system, which requires such a high level of substantiation in such a form that is virtually impossible to obtain. But I ask the Senate: why are we demanding this sort of substantiation at all? Under section 262A(1) of the tax law, there is a requirement which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person carrying on a business must keep records that record and explain all transactions and other acts engaged in by the person that are relevant for any purpose of this Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The documents to be kept are clarified in 262A(2). It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">262A(2) (documents to be kept)</EMPHASIS> The records to be kept under subsection (1) include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)any documents that are relevant for the purpose of ascertaining the person's income and expenditure; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) documents containing particulars of any election, estimate, determination or calculation, particulars showing the basis on which and method by which the estimate, determination or calculation was made.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds pretty clear and like reasonably good English. It seems to me that people running a business&mdash;BHP or whomever&mdash;are required to keep whatever documents they get to support a claim. They might be records of cheques that have gone through, invoices, receipts or whatever. They might be shop records of when a piece of equipment was first used which could support a claim that the item was purchased and received. It might be an estimate of the cost along with whatever was used in making that estimate. Basically, any record that supports a claim can be used, and then it is up to the Australian Taxation Office to believe the claim or call the business a liar, a cheat. That seems reasonable to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here we have a situation where seven out of 10 people in Australia, wage and salary earners, ordinary people, are asked to keep records that go far beyond what BHP is required to keep. For wage and salary earners, this is the proposed rule:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5-4(2) You must get a document from the supplier of the goods or services the expense is for. The document must set out:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)  the name or business name of the supplier; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)  the amount of the expense, expressed in the currency in which it was incurred; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)  the nature of goods or services; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)  the day the expense was incurred; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)  the day it is made out.</PARA>
<PARA>No businesses are required to provide such a document, and they do not. Ordinary people normally tend to think that ordinary accounting documents are sufficient evidence to support a claim. They are not. There is the presumption of knowledge under this law. I know that under the new law people now write in these things, but they have to know they have to write them in. They have to know the tax law enough to know they have to write them in on their receipt&mdash;that is, if they get a receipt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both our office and I understand Senator Watson's office  did straw polls to see whether senators and Senate staff understood what sorts of receipts they needed to keep and for how long. In both cases it was found that it is likely several senators and Senate staffers are unaware of the current legal requirements on substantiation and retention. We are supposed to be making the laws here, and we are putting this on everybody else. We work with the law all the time. If we do not know and cannot follow the letter of the law, do we really expect ordinary wage and salary earners to do so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told there is a softening of requirements as people can fill in some of the information themselves. How many people do we really expect to do so? How many ordinary people know tax law well enough to jot down all the required information on the back of their receipt? Why are ordinary receipts, bank accounts and other papers people actually get insufficient, especially if they are sufficient for business taxpayers? To point out the stupidity and pedantic nature of the hoops we are asking people to jump through I will go to the case highlighted by Mr Rocher in the House: if someone flies on business to Los Angeles for seven days and does not keep a travel log but does keep the airline ticket, they cannot claim for that ticket if they do not try to claim for the other travel expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office says that in a hearing there is discretion to ignore the law. My question is: why does this sort of stupid law exist and why is sanity left to the discretion of someone doing the auditing? The tax office estimates that eight out of 10 people audited make mistakes in their tax forms. The average fine is between $1,200 and $1,500. Somehow I cannot believe that eight out of 10 people are tax cheats and madly trying to rort the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included in this law is a change to the time required for record retention. It requires that records be retained for five years. It also brings retention time for businesses down to five years. So ordinary taxpayers have to keep their receipts in case they are audited for up to five years and businesses less. The government says it is imperative to make things equal but does not make the records that need to be retained equal. They are far more onerous for wage and salary earners. Why is this happening? It is my suspicion that this is just another way of making things easier for business while hitting wage and salary earners. I also think it is so that people are frightened of making claims. If they are frightened of making claims, they will not make them, especially if they think they are likely to be audited up to five years in arrears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the tax office does two main kinds of audit: the desk audit and computer assisted audit. The first is done by people and usually occurs in the year a tax return is received. Computer assisted audits require that all tax returns for the year be fed into the computer as well as other items like car ownership records, land records, bank records and so on. Once the computer has this base, it can start to process the returns and find discrepancies, but it takes a couple of years to load this base into the computer. So the rest of the computer assisted audits are audits that take place two or more years after the tax return. In this context an extended period begins to make sense, especially in the light of high profile purchases of new tax super computers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have in this bill is a situation in which ordinary people are required to hold records longer and face prosecution over a longer period than they do now, to allow them to be turned up by a computer audit. At the same time, the tax requirements are put in simple language, but the requirements themselves will stay so complicated that almost no-one is likely to correctly comply with them. In this situation it is probable that once the tax office gets into gear and starts grinding up people for non-compliance, many people will give up and simply accept that an upper limit on claims is $300 for wage and salary earners since amounts under this do not have the same compliance requirements. I note that currently the average claim is $992. I think this $300 limit is the real agenda here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill comes as part of a process in which, increasingly, the responsibility for correct tax reporting has been shifted to the taxpayer, especially small business and PAYE taxpayers. This might save a bit of money for the tax department, but if you did a cost benefit analysis of the time and effort required for all of that compliance around the country, I would say that it is not particularly economical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Big business and corporations have full-time accountants and tax experts whose primary job is tax minimisation for their companies. Increased self-assessment means that small businesses and ordinary people are caught in a bind where they are responsible for doing everything right and where there is a legal assumption of knowledge. If they do not do everything right, they are slammed as tax cheats. Yet by their nature they have less documentary evidence given them, they have less specialist knowledge and they engage in practices like driving a car partly for work and partly for personal use, using a washing machine partly for work and partly for personal use and so on. Big business has a company car. If it wants to make documentation easy, the car is used only for company business. All bills, petrol and mileage are automatically business expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, we see most people now using a tax accountant, and still people are getting things wrong. The rest generally cannot afford tax agents, so there is a built-in inequity. We see small businesses spending hours every week doing tax work and still living in continual fear that they have done something wrong. We see laws so onerous that it is likely they have done something wrong, no matter how much care they take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens cannot support this bill at this time. This has been shoved through in such a rush mainly, I believe, to gag debate and stop any attempt at real amendment. We might be able to support this bill without extending the retention time limit on the basis that it really is no worse than the current situation. We might support a longer time limit if there was a real effort to properly improve the ridiculously strict requirements instead of simply making them clear. We might support this if it can be amended to allow something like a requirement for ordinary documentation on a par with what is required for business. But we cannot support this bill as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, we have proposed an amendment that we consider a minimum to make this law acceptable. It is simple, really. It just reduces the substantiation requirements for wage and salary earners to the level required for business. If we are talking about a level playing field, here it is. It uses the same words as the business requirements I just quoted as 262A(2). We think if the time people are required to keep documents is increased to make everyone equal, it is only fair to decrease the requirements for ordinary documents in the form ordinarily received to put wage and salary earners on equal footing with business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are having second thoughts&mdash;I hope you do&mdash;we could adjourn tonight, go home after everything else we do tonight, think about this and put some amendments tomorrow. We would be delighted to see this bill improved. As it is, all we are doing, in our opinion, is limiting the ability of wage and salary earners to make valid claims and increasing the period in which they must live in fear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly on the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994. Contrary to most tax bills I speak about in this place&mdash;I speak on most of them&mdash;this bill is one that, I believe, does improve the system of substantiation. It also cuts down on the time that may have to be spent on substantiation. That said, I am mostly speaking about cars used for work or cars used for business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the new rules, there are four methods for calculating deductions for car expenses, unless an exemption applies. The first option, as listed in the explanatory memorandum, is cents per kilometre. The second option is 12 per cent of the original value, which I believe is as good a way as any if you continuously use a car through the year but do not do a high number of kilometres. The third option is a third of actual expenses, which is the fairest but it takes longer and more work to arrive at a very suitable figure. The fourth option is the logbook. The logbook system does not seem to have changed from the one I remember of keeping the logbook for 12 weeks when you buy a new vehicle or when you change the rate of use of a vehicle you have. That may be the case if you have a private vehicle that goes over to business use. A logbook would be kept if that happened. A vehicle does not have to be new for the logbook system to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through the methods one by one and address them briefly. The first method is on the basis of cents per kilometre. This system can be used if the car's business kilometres are up to 5,000 kilometres and it can be used at any time. The second method is 12 per cent of original value. You deduct 12 per cent of the car's purchase price and that is what you use for the whole year, as long as you meet certain obligations. The third option is for one-third of actual expenses. As I said before, I believe that to be the fairest to everyone, but it takes a lot more work. You can use it only if the car's business use exceeds 5,000 kilometres or if you would have used the car throughout the year of income. That is probably the fairest, but you have to be a lot more accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the logbook system of keeping a logbook for 12 weeks continuously, whether you lease or buy. If you use the vehicle for less than 12 weeks, you use the logbook for less than 12 weeks. I do not think that would happen unless you had changed the vehicle's use. Of course, you have to retain the logbook for five years. Senator Watson can probably fill me in on this, but I thought that under the old system you did not retain it quite five years, but that is the way it works now. The logbook system is quite a good idea; I have used it myself. It is very easy to use, especially when there is just one driver using it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not normally do this, but I commend the government on this bill. Senator Margetts was saying that in certain cases you have to keep records for longer, but I believe anyone running a good business should keep records well beyond five years, probably seven or eight years, depending on what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing I would like to question the government on, though. I have never seen it in legislation before that a logbook has to be written in English. I would like to know what the government's thinking behind it is, whether it is lazy substantiation officers or something like that. In this multicultural society I think there would be a few people in Australia who can read English but not necessarily write it. Someone might look askance at that, but there are. My own father could read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> from back to front till the day he died, but he could never write English. If he ever wrote any letters, he wrote them in Italian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of the multicultural society, why are we bringing this law in in this day and age? There could be a situation of an employee of an international company coming from another country to Australia and working here for a few weeks or a few months and having to fill in the logbook. I believe that person should have the option of filling in that logbook in another language. Is the government dinkum about this multicultural society that Senator Bolkus and Senator Evans talk about all the time? I am hoping the minister at the table will address that when I sit down. Otherwise, as far as a new substantiation bill is concerned, I find it quite interesting and I look forward to seeing how it will operate in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise a very serious issue: whether or not a minister, on advice from the Australian Taxation Office, has misled this chamber in a previous debate about taxation laws. I refer to the debate which occurred on 8 December 1994 on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1994. I am not going to largely canvass the issues in this debate, but I think it is necessary for me at this point to raise this issue very clearly. I refer honourable senators to that debate. I raised the issue of the Taxation Office's ruling No. TR94/D8. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . TR94/D8 . . . argued that parliament's exemption from penalty tax of income derived by children or child maintenance trusts had been ineffective from its origin.</PARA>
<PARA>At that time, I raised questions in the chamber about the matter, as did Senator Reid. I continue to quote what I said on that occasion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government promised legislation to ensure parliament's exemption was not frustrated. I happen to believe that what we have here is frustration of that intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the proposed legislation fails to achieve the purpose that I just referred to and, in fact, retrospectively creates new tax detriments for children's income . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the professed views of the Taxation Office, it also alters the previous exemption policy by requiring that capital in both child maintenance and other trusts benefiting children pass to beneficiaries upon reaching the age of 18.</PARA>
<PARA>I was concerned, as I believe a whole range of people were concerned, about a case involving a footballer in Queensland. Both Senator Jones, who is present in the chamber, and you, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, are from Queensland. The footballer was dying of cancer and wanted to establish a trust for his children into which certain payments were to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position, as he understood it, was that the capital of that trust would not need to go to the children. His wife could become a paraplegic; why then should the capital of that trust go to the children, rather than to sustain his wife in that situation? This matter was thoroughly canvassed at that time. At the time, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a hypothetical question. I have received a representation from a Brisbane accountant, Mr Robert Ross, which shows that it is not hypothetical. In fact, it will cruelly affect a family in which the 40-year-old husband is dying of malignant brain tumours. He will leave a widow and five children, the youngest being only 12 weeks old. The government's bill&mdash;this bill that we are talking about&mdash;will impose penalty tax on the children's income from the trust being set up to support the children's education and maintenance and his wife's retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ross states his personal outrage that this bill will affect that family. I share that outrage. I am disgusted that the government and the Taxation Office have come to the end of the International Year of the Family not only not caring about tax justice for families but not caring about people in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Office is pushing through a change in the law by pretending that there always was a requirement to transfer capital to minors. That is not so and was never so.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that in a moment. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is reasonable that trusts may be established with discretion to provide for spouses as well as children.

Why should it be fine for a discretionary trust to be set up for spouse and children through a will but not outside the will to receive the proceeds of a life assurance policy? Why should a trust set up to support the children of a deceased employee have to have the capital passing to the children on their attaining 18 years of age? Often such a trust, having attained its purpose of supporting the children, may revert back to some general welfare fund for employees.</PARA>

If it is placed in the one trust, the problem is that, unless the capital goes to the children or the last surviving child . . . there will be a penalty tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I could go on. By reading this, I remind honourable senators what was said by me and others in that debate on 8 December.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we come to the nub of the situation. The Law Council of Australia has bought into this matter and has written to the President. The lawyers make the point in that particular letter that Senator Sherry, on advice from the ATO, misled the Senate. This is a quite serious matter. I intend to take this up at some future time. Because this is the first time that taxation legislation has come back to us since then, I think it is incumbent upon me to raise the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the Law Council of Australia, Mr Stuart Fowler, wrote to the President of the Senate on 30 January 1995 and referred to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to bring to your attention the circumstances concerning the debate relating to the above Bill. It has been suggested that Parliament was "misled in its debate on the existing law." Whether or not this is so is primarily a matter for the Senate to determine. However, I consider the matter serious enough to bring to your attention the surroundings facts so that you may review the matter and decide what, if any, action should be taken.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the section headed `background' he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time the Law Council of Australia urged the Government to amend Section 102AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The topic was the subject of discussions between representatives of the Law Council of Australia and the Child Support Agency at their regular meetings of the Child Support Liaison Group. Subsequently, in July 1993 the Law Council wrote to the Treasurer setting out its views and urging the Government to amend the Legislation. A copy of our letter is enclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 7 March 1994 the Assistant Treasurer issued a statement advising that amendments would be made to the Income Tax Assessment Act "which will ensure that the provisions relating to the unearned income of children under 18 operate as originally intended." The Law Council assumed from this statement that the Treasurer had accepted our submission and that amendments would be made in keeping with our submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same month Senator Harradine moved amendments to Taxation Law Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993 to ensure that the amendments which had been foreshadowed by the Treasurer would have retrospective effect (that is, ensuring the validity of those transactions which had occurred between 1979 and 1994). For a variety of reasons Senator Harradine withdrew his proposed amendments but only after an indication had been given by Senator Sherry that "the government will consider retrospectivity . . . "</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1994 Taxation Law Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994 was introduced into the Parliament. Because the wording of the proposed amendments relating to Section 102AG was considerably different to what had been anticipated, the Law Council resolved to make a submission proposing various amendments to the Bill as tabled. Enclosed is a copy of the Law Council's letter of 5 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next couple of days Chris Crowley (who was handling the matter) had a number of discussions lobbying in support of our submission. So too did the Assistant Treasurer's advisors. They prepared a response to the Law Council's letter of 5 December. Enclosed with this letter is a copy of a letter from the Office of the Assistant Treasurer (addressed to Senator Vanstone) and a copy of the Taxation Office's comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter was debated in the Senate on Thursday, 8 December 1994. There are a number of references in the daily Hansard . . . You will note when you read the Hansard that more than one Senator queried the basis upon which the Government's amendments were being made. The response from the Government's representative in the Senate (Senator Sherry) was that, relying upon advice from ATO advisors, "the amendments restate the existing law" (page 4234), see also at page 4269, where the Senator said that, in effect, the amendments simply reflected a requirement which was "part of the Parliament's origin intention".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At page 4226 Senator Margetts, while referring to this specific topic said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We understand from the Tax Office that the opportunity available under law, for a child of at least 18, . . . to challenge any trust is sufficient so that the Tax Office will [sic] commit trusts even where they do not transfer assets to the children until they reach a greater age. Perhaps the representative of the Minister can assure the Senate that this is correct. We hope that it is, because it was on this basis that we support the current arrangement. If we find that it is not, we will support amendments for change."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine (at page 4231) said that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Notwithstanding the professed views of a Taxation Office, it also alters the previous exemption policy by requiring that capital in both child maintenance and other trusts benefiting child pass to beneficiaries upon reaching the age of 18."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Reid (at 4233) referred to the Explanatory Memorandum which states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Bill will reinstate Parliament's original intention, . . . ".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I have seen nothing that indicates that that was the intention in, I think, 1979."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are other portions of the debate which are relevant to this issue but no doubt you will read the whole of the debate when considering what, if any, action to take. Suffice is to say, that a number of Senators were concerned at whether the proposed amendments only clarified an ambiguity as claimed by the ATO or whether (as the Law Council has always contended) they went far beyond the intention of the Parliament in 1979.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"one can only deplore that Parliament was apparently misled in its debate on the existing law."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In support of his submission he referred to Section 102AG(8) which provides:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Dwyer argues persuasively that the sub-section clearly supports the argument (that the thrust property did not have to be beneficially transferred to the beneficiary before a trust could be held to comply with Section 102AG.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enclosed is a copy of Dr Dwyer's article and response by Chris Hood, Senior Tax Counsel at the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will note that, in the Law Council's submission of 5 December no reference is made to sub-paragraph 8. I am not sure why this oversight occurred. I can only surmise that in the haste of attempting to prepare a submission it was overlooked. No doubt you will agree that its difficult to grasp the overall effect of a section where only parts of the section are sought to be amended. This is particularly so where the whole of the section is not dealt with in the Amendment Bill and where its necessary to cut and paste.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, sub-section 8 does exist and in our submission it supports the Law Council's view that the amendments in Taxation Amendment Bill (No. 4) were not merely confirmatory of the intention of the Parliament in 1979 but indeed create more restrictive rules about what sort of trust is needed to comply with the scheme of S102AG. If you agree, the ATO advice was grievously wrong and the Senate may well have been misled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994. I join my colleagues in supporting the intent of the bill. The bill is the first product of the tax law improvement project. The tax law improvement project was announced by the government in December 1993 with the object of rewriting the income tax law into simple language. That is not too different from the intent of the corporations simplification legislation, which I have also had some dealings with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the legislation has moved at a very glacial pace&mdash;as Senator Watson properly pointed out&mdash;I think we all support the intent of simplifying the tax act. Very few people understand the complications of the tax act, and even fewer people have read it from cover to cover. I think Senator Watson is the only person on this side who has read the tax act from cover to cover. I see him carrying it around with him  like a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS>; he even has it with him at this very moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax act has become an extremely complicated document.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complications have been broadened by the introduction of the capital gains tax, the dividend imputation, the foreign tax credit system, the foreign investment fund regime, the controlled foreign corporations tax laws and changes to superannuation.

As Senator Watson has pointed out, that may not make it any easier. Certainly, as far as words go, it is a lot better, because there are more than two million words and 5,000 pages in the tax act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can see that Senator Watson is not pleased with the simplification of the legislation. I am trying to give a little accolade to the government. If Senator Watson feels that it is not satisfactory, I yield to him because he, unquestionably, is the expert on this. I was saving some firepower for the area of fringe benefits tax and income tax. It is quite obvious that not only has the government moved at a glacial pace but its performance has been unsatisfactory overall. If nothing else, it has reduced the number of words. I just make that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That must go some of the way to reducing the compliance costs. One of the greatest complaints, other than paying high taxes, is compliance costs for business&mdash;and none is bigger than in the fringe benefits tax. Although the recent review on the fringe benefits tax is not directly related to this legislation, the aim was the same: to reduce the compliance cost and the complexities. That review on the fringe benefits tax was unsatisfactory and not well received within the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost for businesses to comply with the FBT is staggeringly high. A study released two years ago by the Tax Research Foundation estimated that the FBT cost employers $127.5 million, or the equivalent of about 11 per cent of the total FBT revenue raised during the period studied. That research project may be two years old, but the situation has not improved, not even with the government's latest review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other areas in business affect compliance. There are many other grievances and inequities within the tax area&mdash;for example, sales tax. The record keeping within sales tax has long been a concern of business&mdash;in particular, small businesses, because it affects their cash flow. They have to set up all the transactions with all their complexities&mdash;including different scales and marginal rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Businesses must pay the sales tax to the government within 21 days of the end of the month. However, as all businesses would know&mdash;and particularly small businesses&mdash;they are lucky if their invoices are paid within 30 days. While they pay the sales tax on their product within 21 days, at the very best they receive payment for that product within 30 days, and sometimes it blows out to 60 or 90 days. There is an inequity and a compliance cost there which the government also needs to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is provisional tax. If small business reserves its bile for one tax system, it is provisional tax. Of all the disadvantages for a business starting up in this country, provisional tax is the worst. The business gets a double whammy. At the end of the first year, not only does the business have to pay the initial tax but it has to pay provisional tax for the next year. That makes it just about impossible for a business to start up, although I suppose it could start up for a year. By the end of that year, it will have a huge tax bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the uplift factor is attached to that. We still have not come to a satisfactory arrangement in that area either. On this side of the house we believe that the uplift factor should be attached to the CPI, and I am sure the Greens believe that too. I remember the debate in this house last year on the uplift factor which reduced it from 10 per cent to eight per cent. That is not a satisfactory situation. We are committed to reviewing that. The aim of this side of the house is to attach the uplift factor to the CPI. Then there would be consistency and certainty for small business, and not this year by year debate on where it should stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been reports in relation to provisional tax. There may be relief upon the way but often newspaper reports are never to be believed and at the pace that the tax office moves it would seem that relief may be a long way away. But there was a particular report that I may ask the minister to clarify during the committee stage. That was a new tax plan dubbed `pay as you go' and would allow small business payers to drop out of the unpopular provisional tax system. Apparently the tax office has prepared a draft paper outlining how this new system would work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While business, in particular small business, is facing the complexities of the tax act and attempting to unravel it, outlaying dead or wasted money in its compliance, it is also expected to take on a very hostile tax office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an enormous amount of businesses targeted. They are expected to produce over 19 different forms of accounting records. The tax office has sent out memos outlining that it will need at least two weeks down time while the tax audit is being conducted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has unleashed the tax office upon small business for one reason only; that is, to solve the government's budget crisis, to squeeze those last little drops out of the system.

That has come straight out of the Australian Council of Social Services. It is something the government is looking at but we believe not too favourably.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994, and we are just concluding the second reading debate. I know that often in debates on tax law honourable senators take the opportunity not to confine their remarks almost exclusively to the bill before the chamber but to make observations or political remarks about taxation. That is so ingrained a habit in this chamber that it is idle to try to call people to relevance. Nonetheless, those sorts of remarks aside, I can say quite candidly that senators have contributed to this debate in a constructive manner. I note that Senator McGauran has just given the government a spray about what might be. Let us wait, Senator McGauran, and see what is, before we get too excited, and then we can talk about something real rather than something imagined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill is, of course, the first step in the restructuring and rewriting of Australia's income tax law. Some would say that to embark on a course that this bill envisages&mdash;that is, to embark on the goal to make the law more easily understood so that taxpayers' compliance costs are reduced and compliance is improved&mdash;is conceptually sound but factually courageous in trying to achieve a reconciliation of those objectives. I understand that. Making law simple, while retaining its meaning and not visiting unintended consequences, is more like an art than a science, I suspect, but this is the objective of this exercise and, from the accounts given by honourable senators here, it is an objective that in the main has been met. It is in that context that I welcome the coalition's support of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made public consultation and community support a cornerstone of the tax law improvement project. Two private sector representatives have been appointed to the leadership of the project to ensure it has a proper commercial perspective. A 14-person consultative committee will advise on the development of the new law. The members are drawn from peak bodies such as the Corporate Tax Association, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, business, the ACTU, tax agents themselves and academia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been through an extensive public consultation process as well. Nearly 4,000 copies of the exposure draft were distributed, free of charge, to the tax industry and to the general public. Seminars on the exposure draft were held around Australia and attended by more than 1,000 members of the public. The bill as well includes important improvements suggested during the consultation process, particularly to the logbook rules, which are now much easier to understand and comply with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has received widespread support in the community. This is because, I believe, for the first time income tax law will clearly and simply state the rights and obligations of taxpayers. Further, the law will remove unnecessary requirements imposed on taxpayers; it will simplify complex rules that have proved difficult to understand; and it will bring the law more into line with commercial practice and taxpayer behaviour. A survey conducted by the tax law improvement project during the consultation process showed very encouraging results. One hundred per cent of respondents said that the rewrite was an improvement on the existing law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. It is the degree of improvement perhaps that we should be looking at, but it is certainly encouraging to know that they all thought this was better. Seventy-five per cent thought the law would reduce their compliance costs; 48 per cent said that they read the law now; and 84 per cent said that they would read the law in the future if it is to the same standard. They are some useful statistics on, if you like, market testing of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I think Senator McGauran gave us a good example earlier in his address as to how confusing it can be. It certainly entertained Senator O'Chee, as it did me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new substantiation rules are only half the length of the rules that they replace. To understand the existing substantiation rules, I am advised, you would need to have the reading skills of a person who has completed two years of university. The new law should be capable of being understood by a person who has completed year 10 at high school&mdash;so my advice is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to mention all of the changes made to the bill, but I would like to highlight one particular improvement. If taxpayers do not have the documentary evidence listed by the new law, that does not necessarily mean they will be denied a deduction. The documentary evidence rules are there so that taxpayers will know what evidence will be accepted by the commissioner as a matter of course. However, the commissioner also has a discretion to take into account other evidence to establish if an expense has been incurred and is deductible. This discretion is in the existing law, but it can only be used if the commissioner is satisfied that a taxpayer took reasonable steps to get the evidence. This has meant that the commissioner has not been able to use the discretion in some cases. The bill will remove these restrictions on the use of the discretion. In future, all that will be relevant is whether the taxpayer has reasonable evidence or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some questions were addressed to me, as is usual, in the course of the speeches of some honourable senators during the second reading debate. I would like to take this opportunity, before resuming my seat and commending this bill to the Senate, to comment on and answer some of those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> My understanding is that Senator Panizza&mdash;and I did not hear all of his remarks&mdash;referred to the problem in a multicultural society like Australia that people whose first language is not English might have in understanding and complying with law. </PARA>

The English language requirements, I am advised, are spread throughout the act and are under review of the project. The project team includes on its consultative committee Mr Carl Harbaum, who is the head of the Ethnic Communities Council. I expect that, in the next raft of amendments to come forward in this three-step change to the Income Tax Assessment Act, something will be available after November this year so we can address the question that Senator Panizza has referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, Senator Watson raised some questions in his remarks. This may not be a complete reply, Senator Watson, to all of the things that you said, but let me turn to at least a couple of the things that you raised and try to answer them now. One of them was that the project itself is going too slowly. Senator McGauran referred to glacial pace. Given the heroic objectives of this whole project, one can understand caution and concern and, indeed, conservatism in making sure that simplified language is legally expressing the same concept and is not unintentionally harming someone. But I do not think the view that you have put, Senator Watson, is widely shared when you consider that the bill was introduced into the parliament within five months of the commencement of the project's three-year time limit. That is fairly quick going when you realise that the bill has been developed as a model for all future changes. It raises more issues than just substantiation. This time span included a three-month public consultation period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me finish the scripted remarks, and I will come to that question. The team is close to finalising its exposure drafts of the losses and mining provisions. It is also finalising a discussion paper outlining a possible new structure for the income tax law, and the project is also well advanced in a number of areas, such as the very extensive provisions dealing with what is income and what is deductible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson, the question that you posed by way of interjection, as I understood it, was whether the project will be completed on time. If I may, I will pause for a moment and summon up an answer. </PARA>

<PARA>I notice that the Chairman of the Australia Indonesia Institute is the former ambassador, known to all, and former Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Richard Woolcott. He is known to us as the man who held the very powerful and influential position of ambassador to Indonesia in 1975 during the days of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. It is common knowledge that he was the most prominent figure in mounting the case for his country and his government to allow the invasion and to turn perhaps a blind eye to it or even to justify the invasion. The Whitlam government was convinced and he has hung around long enough to convince every government subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have had cause to clash with Mr Richard Woolcott just by way of letters to the editor, and he has published many papers defending his place in history; I claim it to be defending his error in history. I think that his chairmanship of the Australia Indonesia Institute is a slanted one. He does not give any confidence as a goodwill ambassador and, quite frankly, his presence there aggravates me to say that he is more of a stooge than a proper chairman. I think we really should have someone who does not have that type of past in this particular role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to make the point that the vigorous defence of Indonesia by Mr Woolcott and many others like him over the past 20 years or so has been very influential. There is absolutely no doubt about that. He has given great pluck to many and I happen to think that he and many like him have given great pluck to our Australian military, which has equally vigorously defended the Indonesian invasion and the human rights violations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to two particular occasions&mdash;one not so long ago which I brought to the attention of the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray).

<PARA>That is a short version. In the very short time I have available, I want to say that if that was done last year, the military still has not learned. The Indonesian defence commander overseeing East Timor at the time of the Dili massacre was recently out here on tour. Under a blanket of security his visit included an inspection of Australian military technology at the Defence Science Organisation in Adelaide. We all know that that was his main purpose, but Brigadier Adrian D'Hage said he was out here looking at power supply, water purification and sanitation to benefit East Timor. This was proved to be utterly incorrect. That particular former defence commander was not out here for that reason. The military is still misrepresenting the position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to the adjournment debate tonight is to recount to the Senate briefly an impression that was made on me on 16 February 1995 in Melbourne and of which I was reminded again this morning at the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. I am referring to a person who by name sounds very ordinary. His name is John Smith. But I can assure you that behind that very ordinary sounding name is a most extraordinary Australian. Indeed, if anybody were worthy of an award for service to the community, I believe it would be John Smith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Most people may be aware of him in his stereotyping, I suppose, as a member of the God Squad. He clearly is a man of compassion, commitment, concern and care and is a great communicator. He now heads an organisation which has those words&mdash;care, concern and communication&mdash;in its title. He is clearly a very capable, perceptive and incisive social commentator. But he is not only a social commentator; he is also a social worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often said that actions speak louder than words. It is very difficult to know in John Smith's case because he does both so very powerfully. His actions speak very, very loudly, as do his incisive comments on our society. I had the opportunity to spend a day with his organisation in Melbourne on 16 February 1995. The boy within me, I suppose, recalls riding for a short period of time on the back of his Harley Davidson motorcycle around the streets of Melbourne. Whilst that was enjoyable, I must say that the side of me which I would like to think is compassionate towards those who are less fortunate in society was also deeply touched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Smith and his organisation work with those who are clearly the underprivileged within our society&mdash;young recidivists and drug addicts, the young unemployed and those who do not have parents or homes&mdash;who really are not part of what we might consider our mainstream social structure. He works with the prostitutes of St Kilda. He works a very impressive ministry. During that day, I was able to see a number of the activities in which his organisation engages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the afternoon, we took some time out at a bar to have a few drinks and generally have a discussion. He impressed upon me the very real need for the federal government to consider a schools program. John Smith told me whilst we were having this drink that virtually wherever he goes people say to him, `You spoke at my school and you made a lasting impression on me. You only spoke once, but you made a lasting impression.' As someone who has been in party politics, albeit not in the Senate but in my home state of Tasmania, for some time, I get cynical. I was wondering how genuine that comment was. As he finished his Guinness and I finished my beer, all of a sudden a free Guinness appeared from the other side of where we were. A young person came up and said, `You spoke at my school about 10 years ago and I was greatly impressed by it.' So his comments to me earlier about his recognition factor and the impression he has made were borne out by that coincidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Smith is very strong on the point that there is a lack of moral structure or guidelines for youth in this day and age. There are no longer the absolutes, which are so helpful to young people in finding their role in life and society. Everything seems to be relative; anything seems to go. Indeed, a reading of the modern magazines indicates that the role model of Madonna is seen to be the one to aspire to rather than those who give themselves in selfless service, such as Mother Teresa. Because of the societal disintegration that we are suffering from, there are clear symptoms of that, such as youth crime, violence, drug addiction, prostitution and suicide. Basically, a lot of young people are no longer finding that there is a real meaning to life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, combined with a social dysfunction that occurs as a result of that, costs our community very dearly in not only social but also dollar terms. It is unfortunate that I have to put those sort of social problems into dollar terms, but I do so because of what I will be seeking the federal government to do at the end of my brief contribution tonight. Whilst many others are doing marvellous work in dealing with the symptoms of the problems, such as trying to help the recidivists mend their ways and drug addicts to rehabilitate&mdash;Lifeline tries to get people not to commit suicide but to see a meaning for life&mdash;John Smith has a burning desire within his heart to develop a preventive process so that we do not suffer from the symptoms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit to this chamber and the federal government that they should give very serious consideration to funding even just a pilot program of John Smith's organisation to ascertain whether a real difference could be made. If his organisation were given what is small change in social security or law enforcement terms and a program could be established whereby the John Smith ministry could get into every high school within Australia, I would be confident in promising to the federal government that the money it would spend on that program would be returned to it tenfold. It would need to spend a lot less on social welfare and law enforcement agencies. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very briefly want to refer to a problem that emerged in the very serious motion against me which failed to get up today. That was the government's humiliating failure to get its censure motion against me passed in the Senate. I understand that unprecedented and, as far as I am concerned, dishonourable attempts were made to encourage some members of this chamber to vote for a gag on a censure motion. As I understand it, Senator Evans sought support for a gag on the censure motion against me to prevent people on this side of the chamber mounting a defence of my actions in what is the most serious motion that can be brought before this chamber in relation to a senator. I regard that as an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that Senator Evans's sense of what is honourable and decent should be made readily recognisable and available for people in this chamber and outside to make their own judgments about him as a person. His motion was over the top, unbalanced and unreasonable. This has been demonstrated by the way it was amended. I suppose that tells us a fair amount about Senator Evans, apart from his lack of political judgment and his incompetence in handling the matter. It seems to me to be just incredible that there would have been a serious attempt to prevent a proper and full defence of a censure motion being mounted by Senator Evans, endeavouring to convince people&mdash;I am glad they were not convinced&mdash;that a gag should be applied. That is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention briefly that I have some lingering concerns about some elements of what was decided. It is alleged that I left Dr Macdonald no opportunity to respond to what I said here. That is just absolute nonsense. The fact is that I got no electronic cover on Thursday night. The main way people in Australia get their news is through television and radio, particularly the 6.30 and 7 o'clock news programs and the 5 o'clock program on Channel 10. I got none of that on Thursday night because it was done far too late. The only cover I got for my statement was in the print media on Friday morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Macdonald had the electronic media all day Friday, including the peak news programs on Friday evening, the peak television items on Friday evening and the print media on Saturday morning. You can check this by looking at the media and seeing what happened. Dr Macdonald's position was clearly given far greater media attention than my initial statement. I want to make that clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to note in passing that this innocent, lovable person, Dr Macdonald, smeared Mr Fahey. He accused the premier of being part of an orchestrated campaign to smear him, saying his `fingerprints were all over this'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe John Fahey is responsible for in fact getting this person in Canberra to do a . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that at the time Dr Macdonald told a colleague of mine that he recognised that John Fahey had not done such a thing. Yet, on the Saturday of the election, Dr Macdonald was prepared to put that smear of John Fahey in the newspaper. I regard that as disgraceful. We also have the double standards of Labor, which says that Dr Macdonald had acted only on his accountant's advice. Yet through 1982 members of the Labor Party smeared and decried so many Liberal supporters who had also acted only on their accountants' advice when they put in tax returns which involved an understatment of their tax liabilities. We had people like Mr Dawkins and Senator Walsh abusing their privilege in this place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to draw the Senate's attention to an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 23 March 1995. It appeared in the home edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> but not the other edition, and that is a pity. The article in this issue concerns quite amazing hypocrisy. It is entitled `Williams fights estate'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that tourism developer Keith Williams wants the Gold Coast City Council to reject a development proposal for a residential and canal estate on the Gold Coast. Not only does he want to protect his old motor sport raceway, but it seems he wants to get involved in a redevelopment project on the site himself. The developers said that Mr Williams's study of the site did not stack up and so they dropped it. Now Mr Williams wants the whole proposal rejected by the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that one of the reasons cited for not developing the area into a residential and canal estate&mdash;presumably by Mr Williams, although the quote is not enclosed in inverted comas&mdash;is that the site also formed an important flood plain and would perform its natural function indefinitely if allowed to do so. Mr Williams also insisted in the article that he was not anti-development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fullest sympathies go out to Mr Williams in this instance. I can tell him that I know just what it is like to want a municipal authority to reject an inappropriate development proposal. I know what it is like to be concerned that a natural waterway may forever be altered by a large proposal of this sort. I know what it is like to believe that the local authority may be acting in haste, supporting a developer with the promise of jobs, without necessarily examining all of the facts. I know what it is like for someone to question one's attitude to development overall, just because one thinks that a particular proposal could be built in the wrong way, on the wrong piece of coast and affect the natural heritage of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I am not the only one to have this concern. Many people have been working hard for two years and more in connection with a particular development in North Queensland&mdash;which is also thoroughly inappropriate. Along with others involved in the campaign, I would like to offer Mr Williams some support. I can let him know a few techniques in fighting his Gold Coast proposal&mdash;for example, how to get hold of the reports and have all of the parameters of the development independently analysed; how to lobby government and bureaucrats; how to organise and participate in a demonstration; and how to write letters to the media and conservation magazines to educate other people about the problems with the issue. Finally, we could help Mr Williams with his emotional stress&mdash;that is, his emotional stress caused by seeing a heartless process where the greed for pie in the sky bucks is the basis for constant irrational decision making and abuse of process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what it is like to try to preserve a piece of our natural heritage&mdash;not for any monetary gain but because we know in our hearts it is wrong. We know it is wrong to rip the heart out of an area and never have a full and proper environmental impact statement which would enable the effects of the development to be properly understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Mr Williams, `I sympathise with you in your fight to stop your Gold Coast development. If we can offer any piece of advice, please let us know. You see, we are quite experienced now.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. Technically, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet did not issue the questionnaire referred to. The United Nations issued a questionnaire which dealt with the institutional care of children, which is a state government responsibility. A copy of the questionnaire was sent to all premiers, including the Premier of Western Australia, under cover of a letter from the Prime Minister dated 30 October 1951. The Premier of Western Australia was asked to supply the necessary information for Western Australia. In dealing with this matter the Commonwealth's role was as a collation point for information from the states, which it then passed to the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. Input from the Western Australian Premier was submitted in a letter to the Prime Minister dated 30 June 1952. The Premier provided two copies of his Government's response to the questionnaire under cover of a letter dated 30 June 1952, and this letter is held in file 742/1/4. That file does not include a copy of the WA response, although it is noted that one copy was provided to "EA" (the former Department of External Affairs). The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised that an External Affairs file indicates that two copies of the questionnaire response were received from Western Australia via the Prime Minister's Department. One was sent to the Australian Mission to the United Nations in New York to be handed over to the United Nations. The other was sent to the then Department of Social Services. The Social Services file about the questionnaire (file A911 of Commonwealth Record Series A884) was eventually destroyed in accordance with General Disposal Authority 14, paragraph 24.2.2 which provides for the destruction of material which is essentially copies of documents from other agencies. The only possible surviving copies of the West Australian reply to the questionnaire would appear to be with the Western Australian Government or the United Nations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(b) Because only the covering letter from the Premier of Western Australia to the Prime Minister, but not the Premier's response to the questionnaire, has been located on the file (742/1/4) referred to by Senator Chamarette in part (1) of her question, it is not possible for the Commonwealth to respond definitively. Previous correspondence from a member of the public to the Prime Minister, dated 2 October 1993, on what may be the same matter includes a purported quote from the Western Australian response to the questionnaire which appears to verify the claims. But the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has not been able to independently confirm this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(b) As noted in the response to (3)(b), it is not possible for the Commonwealth to reply definitively on the basis of the information available. Previous correspondence from a member of the public to the Prime Minister, dated 2 October 1993, on what may be the same matter includes a purported quote from the Western Australian response to the questionnaire which appears to verify the claims. But the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has not been able to independently confirm this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The archival papers referred to in part (5) of the question are more than 30 years old. As Senator Chamarette has only supplied minute or letter numbers and not complete file reference numbers, it has not been possible to locate the documents on files held by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they could be located these papers would be in the `open period' under the Archives Act 1983. But the Act provides for a range of exemptions covering material such as records the release of which would damage international relations and records containing information of a personal or confidential nature. If a record could adversely affect the interest of a state or territory, the Archives Act requires consultation between the Commonwealth and that state or territory. Without examining the papers therefore it is not possible to confirm whether they would be open to public access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, previous correspondence to the Prime Minister from a member of the public dated 4 October 1994 provided copies of documents which appear to match the descriptions provided by Senator Chamarette. It appears that these documents may have been obtained from the State Archives of Western Australia and, given they were provided by a member of the public, have presumably been deemed open for public access under the arrangements of that body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In light of the response to part (5) above, it is not possible to answer part (6) in specific terms. Even if it is assumed that the purported quotes from the Western Australian response referred to in parts (4) and (5) above are accurate, to provide any opinion on whether the Western Australian response was, at the time it was sent, inaccurate, would require a measure of speculation. It is not possible to state with certainty how the Western Australian Premier, or the officers who prepared the response, interpreted the question or what information they relied on in developing the response. Given the passage of more than forty years, it is unlikely that those involved would be able to shed much light on the issue, even if they were still alive and could be located. Furthermore, the documents referred to by Senator Chamarette in part (5) of her question antedate by months or years the submission of the Western Australian response; it may be that the situation identified in the documents had altered so that the response was accurate at the time it was passed to the United Nations. The Special Minister of State suggests that as the content of the Western Australian response was a matter for the Western Australian Government, it is to that Government that any further queries should be addressed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The prevalence of HIV in Rwanda is high and this fact was acknowledged in the predeployment risk assessment. The risk is greatest for those personnel who deal with casualties and are likely to come into contact with infected blood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) All ADF personnel who deploy to Rwanda are tested for HIV (as well as other blood borne diseases) before they leave Australia. It is policy that they are also tested on their return and again twelve weeks later. The ADF medical contingent in Rwanda has the facilities to test for HIV if there is a clinical need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) All members of the ADF who are deployed to Rwanda receive appropriate training regarding recognition of the HIV risk and how to minimise their exposure and risk of contracting the disease. Any member who is exposed to potentially infected blood is given appropriate counselling and offered AZT therapy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) ADF health care personnel are trained in the application of "Universal Precautions Against Blood And Body Fluids" in the course of their professional training. The non-medical members of the contingent receive specific training relating to the risk from contact with blood, prior to deployment. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is reinforced in country as each group of servicemen and women is attached to the hospital at Kigali, and several times during their tour of duty. All members receive a comprehensive health brief prior to leaving Australia which covers all the diseases of operational significance, including HIV. Appropriate equipment is provided for minimising contact with blood and body fluids, and for contaminated waste disposal. For example, even the non-medical personnel are required to carry latex gloves in case they have to assist in first aid or casualty management at short notice.</PARA>
