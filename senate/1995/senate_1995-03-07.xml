<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with deep regret that I inform honourable senators of the death at 11.10 p.m. last night of Senator Alice Olive Zakharov, who served Australia and Victoria with distinction in this place from 1 July 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Zakharov was a highly regarded and respected member of the Senate. She was an active member and chair of many Senate and joint committees. As an acting deputy president and temporary chairman of committees and as a long serving chair of the community affairs committees, she made a substantial contribution to the work of the Senate and its proceedings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Monday, 6 March 1995, of Senator Alice Olive Zakharov, a senator for the state of Victoria from 1982, a former chair of a number of Senate committees and a temporary chairman of committees from 1987; places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Last night came the news we had all been fearing since we first heard of Olive's terrible accident three weeks ago and learned how serious it was. We have had a little time to adjust since then to the possibility of her death, but it has not made the reality any easier to bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive Zakharov was born on 19 March 1929 in Melbourne. She held an arts degree from Melbourne University and also gained professional qualifications in counselling, which skills she very effectively employed in her main career before politics as a teacher and student counsellor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She grew up in the depression years and later experienced the enormous difficulties of being a single mother without the support mechanisms that are available to women today. She was willing to turn her hand to almost any job to support her family and did so. She was at various times a registered psychologist, pathology assistant, shop assistant, mail officer, waitress and fruit picker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these early years was no doubt born her absolutely determined and unswerving commitments to social justice, to socialism and to feminism with which all of us who knew her and worked with her were so familiar&mdash;the kinds of commitments that led, among other things, to her being recognised as Australian Humanist of the Year in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive came to this place in 1983 having already established a career and raised her family. She had been a longstanding member of the Australian Labor Party; she was an executive member of the Montmorency branch for nearly 20 years. In later years she threw her energies into party and community work in her new suburb of residence, Port Melbourne, as well as being throughout her Senate career an enormously active and dedicated server of rural Victoria. She travelled the length and breadth of the state&mdash;which senators are supposed to do but do not always do&mdash;showing a particular capacity to relate to the lives and work of ordinary country people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know how many significant contributions Olive made to the work of this chamber, among other things, as a Temporary Chairman of Committees, as Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, and as a member of estimates committees and committees on community affairs, regulations and ordinances, senators' interests, ASIO, Joint House, national resources, environment and tourism, video materials and the human embryo experimentation bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was undoubtedly best known publicly for her work on women's issues. Her earlier life and work experience as a part-time student and employee strengthened her understanding of women's role in society and made her absolutely determined to improve the status of women. A committed trade unionist and, as I have already said, feminist, Olive was involved in affirmative action policy development. She was one of the strongest early voices addressing sexual harassment issues. And she was particularly well known for her stand against domestic violence. The measure of her courage and personal strength in this respect was, I think, best demonstrated when in 1993 she spoke publicly, in an effort as always to help others, about the mental and physical abuse that she herself had suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was a strong supporter of the sex discrimination legislation for its protection of not only women but also gays and lesbians. A cause did not have to be easy or especially popular for it to command Olive's attention and commitment; that always came from the heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to appreciate that, here as elsewhere, Olive's commitment was not just to issues in the abstract but to the people who were affected by them. She was fantastically supportive of people in distress and of individuals, organisations and community groups needing support and attention. I can say that with some personal conviction because Olive was very kind, thoughtful and helpful to a member of my own family a few years ago who, as a young teenage girl, was trying to work out what really mattered in life. She found a role model in Olive with a marvellous combination of idealism, compassion and practical humanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to know about Olive&mdash;because it was so important to her&mdash;that while, as we all know, she was the quietest, most unaggressive and unflamboyant of people, she was ideologically, throughout her life, a very fierce socialist, starting her career in this respect, I have to say, considerably further to the left than the ALP! She was certainly a major participant and contributor to the peace movement, being a member of the Campaign for International Cooperation and Disarmament and World Women Parliamentarians for Peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive represented the Australian Peace Movement in 1988, for example, as a witness of the first destruction of a nuclear missile in the USSR under the START treaty. She was Australian delegate to the Vienna Peace Conference in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not that all her involvement in these issues during the Cold War years brought her particularly closer to Russia. There is a delightful story about her being paged at Moscow airport on one delegation visit. When the announcer called for `Olive Zakharova', Olive didn't even begin to recognise the Russian female form of her name and missed the plane accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She did, however, come under notice, it has to be acknowledged, from the intelligence agencies. A few years ago she asked, when this became possible, to see her own ASIO files. She was extremely offended by two things in particular she found. First, her name had been sold to ASIO for an extremely small amount&mdash;her recollection was that it may have been just 2s 6d. Secondly, after some description of her husband, there was a comment in the files about Olive, that she `seems like a nice woman'. Olive was to her legion of friends and admirers throughout the country and certainly in this place more than just a `nice woman'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not always completely honest on these occasions but I am being utterly honest when I say, at least on behalf of all her colleagues on this side of the chamber, that we not only respected and admired Olive Zakharov; we loved her. Mr President, on behalf of the government, I extend to Olive's family, her children, Robin, Jeannie and Martin Zakharov, and also her personal staff, who have been so close to her and who have also had to bear so much stress and pain in the last few weeks, our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. Their loss is all of ours and we are going to feel it for a long time to come. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="1444" SPEAKER="Hill Sen R.M." NAMEID="BH4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of coalition senators to support the motion of condolence upon the death of Olive Zakharov. This is a sad day for the Senate, and particularly for the family and friends of Olive. It is sometimes said that life as a backbench government member or senator is one that provides little opportunity to make a mark in public life. Equally, in an environment in which promotion is sometimes regarded as being dependent on toeing the line, the willingness of backbenchers to hold true to their beliefs and ideals, if that means advocating unpopular and unfashionable views, is at times under pressure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive Zakharov, however, will be remembered in this place because she did make a mark and she did hold true to those principles, causes and beliefs that drew her towards political activism at an early age. That was because she was passionately motivated by her desire to see the elimination of what she regarded as the injustices and faults within our society. That passion was the result of a genuine sense of humanity. It was borne out of her own personal experiences&mdash;be it the deprivation that her family endured during the Great Depression, the discrimination she faced as a woman and a single parent or the natural desire of parents to see their children inherit a safe and peaceful world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that Senator Zakharov came to this parliament relatively late in life, she had been a political activist for the majority of her life. Her time in the Melbourne University branch of the Communist Party during the early 1950s and the attention that that attracted&mdash;which was mentioned by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans)&mdash;are well known. A little later, she began her long association with the Australian Labor Party and, in particular, the Socialist Left of the Victorian branch of that party, an association which I understand lasted for over three decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her maiden speech&mdash;as they were then known&mdash;Olive Zakharov spelt out her commitment to many of those issues which were to be at the centre of her contribution to the parliament during her time here: issues such as social justice, poverty, unemployment, discrimination and the world peace movement. Those issues were, of course, not new to her. In particular, Senator Zakharov had had a long-time involvement in the peace movement, both in relation to the Vietnam War and the broader issue of nuclear disarmament. That role was acknowledged in 1988 when she was invited as a representative of the Australian peace movement to witness the destruction of four Soviet SS22 missiles on the Kazakhstan steppes which commenced the Soviet Union's implementation of the START treaty. She was one of just 28 guests and the only foreign parliamentarian to attend. It was an occasion that she described in this chamber as `the chance of a thousand lifetimes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the eve of International Women's Day, I also want to acknowledge her role as an advocate of women's rights. She fought with undoubted commitment against the type of discrimination she had personally endured. Needless to say, she was, as Senator Gareth Evans said, a supporter of the current government's anti-discrimination legislation, introduced in its first year of office. She also campaigned against domestic violence directly towards women. Her courage in revealing her own personal suffering in November 1993 was an example of that. Highlighting just two of these areas probably does not do justice to the broad range of issues that Olive Zakharov involved herself in. She was certainly not a single issues person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could mention her commitment to the cause of gay and lesbian rights and her tangible support for the fight against HIV and AIDS through her involvement in organisations such as the Victorian AIDS Council and the Victorian AIDS Trust. Equally, I could also mention her support for people with disabilities. In her first speech, Senator Zakharov used a quote from Hamlet to epitomise her personal philosophy. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man</PARA>
<PARA>And, of course, she then added `woman'. She concluded that speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I state unequivocally that I am a socialist, a unionist and a feminist and that I intend to spend my term in office in the service of the people of Victoria, working towards a society where every individual can live with dignity and security.</PARA>
<PARA>I doubt whether there is anyone in this chamber that in the framework of her strong beliefs would argue that she failed to live up to those commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a personal sense, I will miss Olive Zakharov. I particularly admire politicians with a sense of cause. She was a very genuine and committed person yet, as the minister also said, always friendly and courteous. She touched many lives for the better, and she worked for the benefit of many that she would never meet, particularly the exploited and the disadvantaged. I am personally pleased to publicly have this opportunity to recognise her very significant contribution to our community and our society. On behalf of all opposition senators, I extend my sincere condolences to Senator Zakharov's three children, her family and her friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I rise to support the condolence motion for Senator Olive Zakharov. In this place and in this occupation, we get to know some of our colleagues better than others. In this place, such is the frailty of human existence, we get to speak fairly regularly on condolence motions. But I have not previously spoken to a condolence motion for a contemporary&mdash;for a woman I saw every sitting day, sitting over there not far from me. I did not know Olive Zakharov as well as I might have liked to, but her death has given me the opportunity to reflect on her speeches and to read about her life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of my colleagues in the Democrats, I extend our sympathy to her family. To her children, her two daughters and her son, I can only say that her words and deeds are an admirable testimony to the woman who was their mother, and I hope they can take some comfort from this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was referred to by Senator Hill, Olive Zakharov in her first speech described herself as a socialist, a unionist and a feminist. She said that these descriptions of her were `unequivocal'&mdash;I think that is the Olive we know. I would add that Olive Zakharov seems to me to have been an idealist also, and an idealist in the best sense of the word. We would all recognise that maintaining idealism is a very difficult task in politics. Olive Zakharov was a believer in the worth of each man, woman and child on this earth. Working for a society in which respect and dignity for each human being are the norm was one of her most deeply held motivations, and her life's work exemplifies this commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that Olive Zakharov was a strong unionist; she said that many of her childhood memories were of the Depression of the 1930s. She believed that it was only through the solidarity of the trade union movement that workers could attain safe working conditions and fair wages. She is also reported as saying that many politicians were out of touch with the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is easy to understand her frustration with the fact that so many Australians seem to believe that proper working conditions just eventuated from the goodness of employers' hearts. From her own experience, she knew better. As someone who had worked as a shop assistant, mail officer, waitress, fruit picker, and teacher, she knew, as she said, what it was like to be exploited&mdash;and doubly so as a female. I understand her interjections of disgust, which were audible to me in many a question time, at the underlying assumptions of the questioner. We all now know about Olive Zakharov's experience of domestic violence, and speaking out about it was a courageous act for a woman who was obviously inclined to be very private about her personal life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were other aspects to this modest woman's life, not the least of which was her commitment to the peace movement. To be the only Western politician invited to watch the destruction of some intermediate range missiles, under the agreement made between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Regan in 1988, is a very special recognition of her work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mother, musician, bushwalker, peace activist and politician&mdash;on this, the eve of International Women's Day, I think it is true to say that Senator Olive Zakharov will be remembered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate the members of the National Party in the Senate with the condolence motion for Senator Olive Zakharov, as moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans). I know I speak for everyone here when I say how saddened I was to hear of her accident. Olive passed away last night, without regaining consciousness, and I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to her family and many friends&mdash;and particularly to members on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive entered this place as an ALP senator for Victoria in 1983. I remember her well because we both came into this place on the same day. In her first speech, Olive affirmed her commitment to securing social justice and equity for the powerless and disadvantaged in society&mdash;low paid textile workers, the aged, the disabled, the single parent families and their children&mdash;and she pursued this commitment vigorously during her 11 years as a senator. Education, health and welfare constituted her overriding interest, and she campaigned to improve the lot of women, single parents, Aboriginals and migrant families in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was born in 1929 in Victoria. Her experience in growing up during the harsh Depression years were to shape her commitment to social justice for all Australians that was to remain forever with her. After leaving school she undertook many diverse jobs, including work as a fruit-picker, shop assistant, waitress and clerk. The experience she gained from working with a variety of people enabled her to be such an effective representative of the Victorian people when she entered federal politics later in her life. She returned to complete her education in the early 1960s, studying for an arts degree and other degrees. That was a great achievement considering she was also raising three children and working at weekends to pay for university fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After graduating, Olive Zakharov worked as a school counsellor until her election to the Senate in 1983. During her time here, Olive's great commitment was evident from her participation in the committee stage and chairing various committees. She served as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources, which I remember well as I travelled around Australia with her as part of that committee. She also served as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and then on the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Olive also participated in the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, the Joint Select Committee on Video Material and the contentious Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill. As well, Olive was an extremely hardworking member of estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout her time in the Senate Olive Zakharov maintained her great interest in education, welfare and health issues and was a tireless advocate for the underdog in the best Australian tradition. In recent years she spoke out against domestic violence, raising a serious social issue that many would rather leave unspoken and placing on the public record her own experiences of physical and mental abuse during her marriage. Due to great reserves of strength and fortitude, Olive left that abusive situation and brought up three children on her own. As a single parent of three, she experienced at first-hand the pressures and difficulties of raising a family single-handedly. It was these experiences that made her such a tireless advocate for women and children suffering in similar situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive Zakharov served the people of Victoria well for 12 years and I am sure would have served for many more years had this tragic accident not prematurely ended her life. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in extending sympathy to Olive Zakharov's family, her two daughters and son, and also her many friends. </PARA>

She will live in people's memories as a champion of social justice, a women's advocate and a worker against discrimination of any kind.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to join with all colleagues in this condolence motion. This morning my car driver, when he was informed by me of Olive's passing, said almost the very same thing as the ASIO agent&mdash;that she appears to be a nice woman&mdash;except my car driver did not use the word `appears'. He said quite categorically, `She was a nice woman.' Of course, she was more than that, as has been so eloquently expressed around the chamber today. There is not a great deal more I could add to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I served with Olive Zakharov on a number of committees, as many of you did as well. Some of the contentious committees, as Senator Boswell said, were the Select Committee on Video Material and the Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill. There were clearly differences of view expressed, but at least one thing about Olive that is not necessarily displayed by members of parliament is that you always knew where she stood. I think everybody around this chamber would appreciate what I am saying: you always knew where she stood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could have a discussion with her about particular matters and you could hear the questioning that was developed by her in particular committees. Though there were differences of opinion, one always knew that there was a similar objective to be achieved&mdash;the objective of trying to achieve a societal response to the imperative that every individual human being has an inherent dignity. From where that inherent dignity is derived is another question&mdash;a deep question which a speaker would not be able to discuss in the time available. Social justice was an issue which I know concerned her all her life. In the area of industrial relations, I suppose it concerned her as much as it concerns me even at this time. But more of that later; this is not the time to canvass those particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that senators do not depart this place by dying of natural causes or from old age? I think since I have been here there have been three sitting senators&mdash;somebody can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;for whom there have been condolence motions moved. There was Ivor Greenwood, who died suddenly of a heart attack. There was John Knight, who also died suddenly of a heart attack. There was Alan Missen, who was sitting at the same time, and Olive. It is an added feeling of loss, I suppose, when you consider that Olive was going to retire. This was her last term, as I understand it. She was a great seeker after peace&mdash;peace for the whole of the world. She was a great seeker after changing societal structures which exploited people, and that is very important. Ultimately, with those societal structures having been changed, you need an added emphasis, and that is inner healing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pray that Olive has now found peace. I also join my colleagues in expressing my deepest sympathy to Olive's daughters and son and also to Olive's staff, who were extremely loyal to her and had every reason to be, because she was extremely loyal and generous to them. I am sure they would not mind my saying that now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to support this condolence motion and pay tribute to the life and work of Olive Zakharov. I knew Olive through my work in the Labor Party in Victoria. Her term as a senator coincided largely with the term in which I was secretary of the Victorian Socialist Left, so my relations with and views of Olive were developed in that context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive's untimely and tragic death has taken from us a great comrade and colleague. My experience is, as has been stated here, that Olive was indeed an unflinching socialist, a unionist and a feminist. She was indeed a very proud member of the Socialist Left and she had a lifelong commitment to building a better Australian society through the Australian Labor movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive embodied the great traditions of socialist humanism in this country. She was born at the outbreak of the Depression and she saw through that experience the inherent wrongs of capitalism that, in her view, gave rise to deep poverty and, of course, to fascism in the 1930s, a world war, and other conflicts throughout recent decades. That experience instilled in her a lifelong commitment to peace, social justice and civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive epitomised the experience of a generation of Australian socialists. Her parents passed on to her, as she passed on to her children, a deep commitment to social change and human dignity. She explained that her most vivid memories of the 1930s were that of men coming to the door for food and money, of the humiliation of poverty and the indignity that stems from inequality. She said that her memories of the talk of home were of fascism in Italy and Germany and the struggles in the Spanish Civil War. Of course, these experiences helped shape in her a commitment to peace and social justice which eventually led to her coming here to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive probably did join the Communist Party in the 1940s. She was driven by a sense of idealism and a hatred of inequality. She studied at the Marx school in Melbourne in 1946 and 1947. She is remembered fondly by the comrades of that period, who talk of her selfless and honest approach and her direct approach to political struggle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was her work in the Communist Party which brought her into conflict with the security forces and secret police of this country, a struggle which of course was played out finally through her work in the parliamentary committee that was supposed to be supervising ASIO. That struggle with ASIO had arisen over the issue of the release of Olive's file, which Senator Gareth Evans has already referred to. If I recall correctly, the issue at the time was that ASIO was most concerned about the 30-year rule for the relief of archival material and wanted it extended to 50 years. ASIO had argued that its files were incomplete and that any release of information might identify agents who had provided original material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive said that the release of her own file was in itself a revelation because it contained only a fraction of the material actually held by ASIO and the information disclosed was inaccurate and the bulk of the material inconsequential. The very thought of ASIO chasing fine and, I think, peace loving people like Olive Zakharov to me highlights just how ludicrous  the whole operations of the Cold War were in Australia and, of course, her experiences really do demonstrate that to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive's world view was shaped by experiences of her younger years, but they did not remain fixed. Her views grew out of her experiences of life and society and, as they changed, so did her views. She commenced her teaching training in the 1950s and, like many women of that period, had to leave it as she devoted her primary energies to raising her three children&mdash;Robin, Martin and Jeannie. She completed her degree as a mature age student. She was a teacher, a psychologist and a student counsellor. She taught at Montmorency High School. She maintained a lifelong interest in education, seeing education as an important vehicle for the achievement of personal emancipation and the development of a comprehensive, coherent state education system as being fundamental to a just society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She fought in the battles of the 1970s against conservative state governments to build decent state education in Victoria. Of course, she was horrified by the destruction wrought by the current Victorian state government, which has done so much to reverse the achievements of teachers of Olive's generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive's humanist philosophy found outlet in a range of other issues. She was particularly active in the area of AIDS education and an early advocate of the acceptance on equitable terms of gays and lesbians in Australian society. Olive campaigned internationally for the recognition of AIDS awareness. She took a leading role in campaigning within the Australian government at the time when this issue was far less understood than it is today. Her last public function as a senator was to attend the mid-summer festival launch of the ALP's gay and lesbian network. Her interest in human relations issues goes back to the days when she was a teacher and, as a pioneer, she was instrumental in developing a human relations curriculum. Olive was very much ahead of her time on these and many other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive also had a keen commitment to the arts. Her son Martin is a jazz musician, which meant that Olive had a particular interest in his work. But she was just as happy listening to the MSO. Olive was interested in all aspects of the arts, which was consistent with her humanist outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was a committed environmentalist and was particularly proud of her Senate work on the Antarctic and Kakadu. Her concerns for environmental issues, however, included a commitment to fighting for decent public housing and urban planning. She was an opponent of developments that undermine a community's sense of its own identity and of its history and, as a consequence, fought against such proposals as the bayside development in her suburb of Port Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her concern for the social environment extended beyond education to the development of proper public health and aged-care accommodation. She had a view of law reform and censorship which saw the state as an instrument for the emancipation of humanity when harnessed to a respect for individual rights and human dignity. Public institutions, in Olive's view, should be geared towards alleviating social injustice, and her latest work on prison education is one example of her maintenance to that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was a feminist and a campaigner for full equality of women through the proper participation of women in all aspects of social organisations, particularly their political processes. As the only female Labor federal member of parliament from Victoria, she was rightly proud of her contribution. However, Olive did not see feminism in a one-dimensional light; she saw throughout her life the fundamental importance of class in dividing our society and perpetuating inequality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive's political career in the Labor Party was an extensive one. She was the backbone for many years of the Victorian Labor Party's health and welfare policy committee, and she helped develop Labor's views on many areas of health policy, particularly those relating to women's health. She was a delegate to the Victorian state ALP conference between 1972 and 1985. She was a member of the Montmorency branch of the Labor Party and an executive member between 1973 and 1983. She was an executive member of the old Diamond Valley FEA throughout the 1970s, and she secured a preselection for the Senate in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well recall the night of the Socialist Left executive meeting at which she did secure the recommendation. While I will not mention the name of her rival, I do recall the incident very well. It was suggested to us that it would be appropriate that Olive would probably serve the party better in the Senate, and her rival who put this case would probably best serve the party in the House of Representatives. I think Olive was particularly pleased to point out to me only last year how delightfully ironic it was that she went on to serve 12 years and the proponent of this proposal served 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a senator, Olive sought to reach out to her community and her constituents. She remained an active advocate for trade union rights and for community participation. She took special pride in her work with rural communities, particularly in the Mallee, where she sought to provide a service to country women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive's view of society and politics reflected the experiences of a generation and were shared by many hundreds of thousands of Australian activists of her generation. Her experiences and the lessons she drew from them had a common meaning that was shared by socialists within the Labor Party. I think a good summary of Olive's qualities and commitments can be found in a quote from another former member of the Communist Party of Australia, Jack Mundey, whose views I think Olive might have shared. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ecologists with a socialist perspective and socialists with an ecological perspective must form a coalition to tackle the wide ranging problems relating to human survival.

Like many senators, when I first heard the news of the accident on St Kilda Road&mdash;it seems a few days ago&mdash;I was alarmed. Within the first 24 hours there was a hope that the injuries were not as serious as they turned out to be. We then learned as the days passed that there were very serious injuries and her concussion remained with her until she died. </PARA>

Another Labor senator died 74 years before Olive as a result of an accident in a Melbourne street.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting this condolence motion for my friend and colleague Olive Zakharov, I would like to endorse all the contributions that have been made in recognition of Olive which have paid tribute to her hard work, dedication to social justice and commitment to raising the status of women. I would particularly like to convey my sympathy to her family and staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was a founding member of the government's status of women committee and worked with Pat Giles, its first chair, to institute a full caucus committee which monitored the work of ministers in those early days in the life of the Labor government. In 1983, the thought of having a status of women policy committee that actually influenced ministers, not to mention their departments, was something about which Olive felt very strongly. I remember well the way she spoke at those meetings when somewhat bewildered members of the bureaucracy would come forward to be questioned by Olive about their commitment to social justice and reforms for Australian women. We take it for granted today, but at that time it was very new and very revolutionary. I might say that it was somewhat reluctantly accepted in certain quarters at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, development of women's policy was not fully recognised in all sectors of the bureaucracy or in the parliament. Olive was vocal in insisting that ministers and departments adopt a women's agenda which reflected recognition of the need for major social reform to start redressing the inequity between women and men. So many of the achievements that we will be marking tomorrow on International Women's Day&mdash;20 years since International Women's Year 1975&mdash;can directly be traced to the work of Olive Zakharov. She has been a pioneer in her work in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One special occasion that I am sure she would want me to share with you was the time we finally persuaded members of the defence department to appear before the caucus status of women committee to answer questions about how they were changing their attitudes to women. If you can imagine all the pomp and splendour of senior defence department officials being questioned in that committee in 1983 by Olive Zakharov, who was so totally committed to the peace movement, you will know why I wanted to share that with you today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive brought many qualities to the parliament. Perhaps her most significant characteristic was that she brought to all areas of her work the views and experiences of ordinary Australians. She never changed in this place. Some people do change as a result of this rarefied atmosphere&mdash;the time spent away from the constituency, the nature of the work and the pressures. Olive was not at all one of those who changed. She was always totally unassuming and modest in all she did, but she always reminded us very forcefully if at any time the views of ordinary men and women were not being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She remained loyal to the people she knew so well from her extensive community work and former career as a teacher, student counsellor, and psychologist. She was, in her own words, `a socialist, a unionist and a feminist'. She was also a humanist and very much an idealist. Perhaps it was these aspects of her experience and ideology that enabled her to serve so effectively on the many caucus, Senate, and community committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was especially dedicated to education and social justice and gave emphasis to people with special needs, including the unemployed, disabled, migrants and Aborigines. As all honourable senators know from her work both in this chamber and around the building on the many committees, Olive was always first to the meetings, always on time, always serving on more committees than some of us and always giving that total commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think she would not mind my saying that there was only one occasion on which she missed a division. That happened when the women's peace camp was on the lawns outside Old Parliament House in the mid-1980s. Olive, along with two others, Pat Giles and me, was visiting the women's peace camp, and I am afraid we had not checked with the whip. In those days there was not the same closeness of numbers; nevertheless, we were very contrite. I remember Olive saying that, if she had to miss a division once in her career, she was pleased that it was for the women's peace camp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, Olive would recognise the red roses on her desk not as mere floral tributes from her Senate colleagues but as socialist roses, very special roses&mdash;the international symbol of the socialist movement, and very much as a reflection of her fundamental philosophy of commitment to social justice. </PARA>

It was on about my third day in this place when I had turned up to my first committee meeting. In these events, I usually tend to sit back, keep quiet and watch. But I was exposed to Olive's views on education in that committee, and I could not help myself. I found I had to speak up. On many occasions we very much disagreed on particular matters of education. It is a great tribute to Olive and the way in which she was prepared to negotiate things through that most of our reports&mdash;virtually all of them&mdash;over the last four years have been bipartisan in nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Zakharov had been involved in education for a very long time, as was pointed out earlier by other speakers.

She always reminded us that students should be the focus of our concerns when we deal with educational matters. </PARA>

We also had other landmark reports, like our one on youth unemployment called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wanted: Our future</EMPHASIS>.

She gave some excellent foundation material to the secretariat. We have not yet even called for any witnesses on this inquiry, which is not due to start until about June this year. It was typical of Olive that she was busy behind the scenes working to support an issue which she saw as being extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Zakharov has also helped with a number of other inquiries in the Senate. Her work in them has been tireless. She was certainly the most regular attendee at all our private meetings. She was always at the interstate hearings. She was keen to talk to witnesses during coffee breaks. She would spend her own time in the promotion of the committee's work when she was out and about on other official duties. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As committee chair, I found Olive's ruling to be always fair. She pulled me up on many occasions. She was flexible in allowing the committee to collectively manage the inquiries it undertook under her chairmanship. </PARA>

I had the honour of serving on three committees with Senator Zakharov&mdash;community affairs, joint house and Senate estimates.

Many of those views did not necessarily coincide with mine.</PARA></TALK.START>

Olive did that with great dedication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found her an exceptionally hard worker on all those committees, as Senator Tierney, from his relatively brief experience with Olive, very eloquently stated. She was a member of a number of committees in which I participated but she was also chairman of the community affairs committee. Once again, I might not have always agreed with Olive but I could never say that I did not respect her, her knowledge of standing orders, her knowledge of Senate practice, her intelligence, her capabilities and, above all else, her fairness. She was very diligent, I have to say, in protecting her government regardless of whether we thought the government needed protecting. </PARA>

I do not mind saying that very few of us on the joint house committee at that time even considered or contemplated that and obviously nor did the builders. I think she brought a dimension to this place that many of us really had to open our eyes to. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been elected to the Senate at a time when the irrationalities of capitalism have inflicted increasing suffering and humiliation on very large numbers of our fellow Australians and most particularly on the weakest&mdash;workers unprotected by trade unions, the aged, the disabled, children and adolescents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think we have heard today&mdash;and we all knew it, of course&mdash;that Olive successfully discharged her mandate to work tirelessly to change the country and other things in her period in this Senate. In that, she is a model for so many other people because, when she first came into this chamber, there were within the Labor Party just a few women who were the models for others to follow. Now, throughout the Labor Party, young women take up that torch and have been inspired by that model of quiet efficiency that Olive represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive's political life was devoted to the Left cause. As one who shares that perspective, I feel it is important to emphasise that she made a contribution to the creation of views&mdash;on the left side of politics and in the parliament generally. For that, I would like to acknowledge her very important role, because ideas are the important thing. Often the ideas quietly expressed are just as powerful as some of the words expressed in this chamber that are full of cliches and not much else. Olive was a person who thought through the problems and attempted to get solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In every way, she epitomised service to the Labor movement. She worked for a society of equals&mdash;equal respect for all people and equality in control of their lives with equal access to resources. In the past, the Labor movement often focused on class inequality while, at the same time, overlooking other types of inequality. Olive fought inequality wherever she saw it; social inequality between women and men was of particular concern to her. She was a visionary and an active feminist who saw that gender inequality disadvantaged both women and society, because society missed out on the valuable talents of women. I was prompted by Olive, Pat Giles and Margaret Reynolds over many years on those issues in such a way as to ensure that I, along with those of us who are male, was not able to lose the scales that often prevent us from seeing the obvious importance of them as major political issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive has played a role in transforming the ideas of so many of us that perhaps not everybody will understand. Of course, that goes for so many other issues, because what she really sought to do was to calmly and gently bring people to understand the issues of inequality and awaken in them the desire to change things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She did not believe that caring was women's work and had no place in government, and that is a unique contribution that is very easily not acknowledged enough. I suppose it is only in more recent times that this is becoming a conventional wisdom. In the early years of our government, her persistence in that issue was most vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that always struck me about Olive is that her experience as a psychologist enabled her to bring out the best in those around her; it even allowed her to deal with some of the more difficult personalities in this chamber and this parliament. Thinking about that, I certainly appreciate that she often was very perceptive about the foibles and weaknesses of some of us, but she always played a positive role in dealing with those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer just briefly to what I think was a characteristic of her work, which I commend to everybody&mdash;and it might be seen to be a bit of a left perspective: she would participate in a mass movement of people and then come into the chamber and participate in the parliament. She, as much as anybody I know, carefully moulded that activity in the community yet at the same time participated in the highest levels of government discussion. That participation in the movements of people in this country, as has been mentioned, was very significant in the peace movement. I have been associated with her in that peace movement, and some of the things that have happened are the direct result of that contribution she made. Many people are now in the situation of benefiting from those activities that she undertook over many years in small groups of people, rallying people to the attainment of world peace and disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the fact that, just at a personal level, in this sort of left corner of the chamber, we will miss her very greatly. I do not know how we ever will be able to overcome the loss of friendship and comradeship that we had with Olive. I can only pass on my condolences and join with others in passing those condolences to her children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I came into this chamber in 1987, Olive Zakharov was then the only federal female member of parliament for Victoria; and she and I became the only two female senators for Victoria, until Judith Troeth joined us in 1993. From 1987 to 1990, we were the only two female federal members&mdash;senators or members&mdash;representing Victoria. That meant that Olive and I found ourselves speaking at a large number of functions, a large number of nursing home openings and a large number of public meetings, on a platform together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I always found with Olive was that, even though we were miles apart politically, we shared a mutual respect for each other. Whenever she was forced into the situation of defending a position in public in Victoria, she argued her point on the issues and never personalised the debate. But, when it was appropriate for us to cooperate&mdash;and there were such times&mdash;there were occasions when Olive and I could take off our political hats and put on our parliamentary hats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give you one example of that. Because Olive and I shared a professional affiliation, both being psychologists and members of the Australian Psychological Society, at one stage we were invited to speak at an APS meeting. We were asked to speak on parliament, the role of parliament and the way in which professional organisations could make their representations to parliament and participate in legislation and the formation of legislation. Olive rang my Melbourne office and said to me, `Is there some way we can have a discussion beforehand so you can cover some issues and I can cover the others?' So Olive and I discussed what she would cover and what I would cover. I think some of our professional colleagues, both psychological and political, may be surprised that such cooperation was possible. Possible it was and effective it also was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances that I also saw Olive's ability to put principle above party, an attribute which is vital for members of that committee to ensure that the rights of individuals are not infringed. Olive often took a line that was not always popular with her ministers and/or the bureaucracy. But I feel that the achievements of that committee are due to its members, as I said, putting principles, and the principles of that committee, first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also know how strongly Olive felt, as others have said, about many issues which have been mentioned in the chamber today. More than once I would look up when Olive was in the chair as Acting Deputy President to find her nodding when I was speaking on issues of privacy, about people with disabilities or on aged care. After she had been nodding vigorously one day which was not long before a preselection of mine, I said to her quietly outside, `Olive, please don't nod so vigorously because if word of that gets around my preselection might be threatened.' Whenever I looked up after that and Olive was tempted to nod, we would have a little smile between us and I knew that meant she was really nodding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we were sitting in airport lounges or swinging, as we did on one occasion, in hammock-type seats on an air force aircraft going back to Melbourne during a strike often we would find ourselves talking to each other, and Olive talked about her family. She often talked about her children and her grandchild. It was obvious she was very proud of their achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also had a great affinity with her staff. We will remember how strongly she felt about one of her staff who had a child. That staff member would often bring her child up to Canberra. You would often see Olive getting off a plane with prams, strollers, car seats and all sorts of things in order for her staff member to be able to continue working for her even though she had a small child. So Olive put into practice what she believed. I join with my colleagues in conveying my sincere condolences to her family, in particular her daughters and her son, and also to her staff. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief contribution in joining in the words already said on behalf of Olive Zakharov. I will not canvass what has already been canvassed except to agree particularly with the contributions by some of my colleagues on this side. Margaret Reynolds reminded me of the many times that she, other Labor colleagues in this place and I have had the benefit of Olive's wisdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a couple of things about Olive. I think she had the balance in a special way between passionate commitment and tolerance. Indeed, I think not many of us get it right and certainly we do not get it right the way Olive did&mdash;that is, no matter how passionately she felt, and she was passionately committed to those issues that have already been mentioned, that never stopped her tolerating, really tolerating, people who held a different view. I guess there were some times when I wished people had paid Olive the same tolerance that she paid them. I think it was that balance of her passionate commitment and tolerance that was one of the many things that I will hold dear about her and in particular that I learned from her. I am not sure I have mastered it in the way that she had, but it is something that she taught me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive also had a great sense of humour. Sometimes her sense of humour was not recorded, or at least not by name. I particularly recall the sex discrimination debates which took place in this chamber where the opposition made some of the most ridiculous contributions to public debate ever on record. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> records `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government senators interjecting and laughing</EMPHASIS>'. I would love you to know that among those government senators were Olive, Margaret, Pat Giles and me. But it was particularly Olive who sat through hours of that debate and laughed, as we all had to, at the folly at that time of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive had also mastered that lovely line `Don't be too polite, girls'. The balance about it was that she was mannerly in dealing with people but absolutely clear about not being too polite when it came to saying her view about issues and campaigning for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bruce Childs has also made a marvellous contribution today in saying that, when you read about parliamentarians who are worthy of scathing criticism, somebody like Olive has been overlooked. Many others could also be mentioned, but today we are talking about Olive. Bruce Childs's comments about that are something about which I will also be able to remind anybody who is critical of parliamentarians. It is an excellent point. In summary, Olive Zakharov was an excellent example of a fine parliamentarian and a splendid example of why women should be in parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to pay tribute to Senator Zakharov. I first met Senator Zakharov as a candidate in the 1993 election, which senators will remember was fought with a degree of acrimony on both sides. I was to meet Olive for a community radio debate on the issues of the campaign. As a candidate, I will admit that I was perhaps not looking forward to this encounter. However, as has been previously canvassed, Olive was a person who concentrated on issues rather than personalities. To my relief, but also to my pleasure in fighting an intellectual debate, we were able to have a reasoned debate of the issues on air and that was something for which I was grateful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to record my memory of her as a passionate fighter for the cause of women&mdash;if not for affirmative action, then certainly for equal opportunity. That is something I feel she always made a point of arguing very well. I would also like to record the way in which her memory should be reviewed in country Victoria. I am also from country Victoria. Wherever you go in country Victoria, both municipal associations and ordinary citizens and townspeople speak very well of the way in which Olive continually travelled around country Victoria not only to hear what people had to say but  also to take those issues back to government. I would like to place on record her contribution in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least I have been, for a brief time, with Senator Tierney on the employment, education and training committee. I also observed that Olive was a great contributor on that committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Olive Zakharov has left this chamber with many friends and no enemies. That is not a claim that many of us will be able to make when we leave this chamber. She set another distinction, of course&mdash;she was born in the Melbourne suburb of Kew. I think Gough Whitlam was also born there some 13 years earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a long association with Olive in terms of Senate campaigns which I might mention in a moment. But if there were two outstanding qualities that summed up Olive Zakharov, one was loyalty and the second one was courage. Olive was loyal to the Labor Party to the extreme and loyal to the members of the Labor Party who thought the same way as she did. I never once knew Olive to waver when it came to loyalty to her party, to her faction or to her friends. When it comes to courage, she sometimes took up some rather unpopular causes out in the community and in this chamber and she never wavered. I saw Olive in action in the caucus, in the parliament and in party fora and never once did I see her not support the principles that she had held for a lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I most fondly remember Olive as one of the great advocates of a separate Senate campaign. We are all used to general elections in which issues of the House of Representatives dominate, but Olive always battled on with the car stickers, the badges and the badgering of me to get out to meetings. She always said that it could make a difference. It did once. In 1993 everyone&mdash;including her own faction, her own party and even me on occasions, I have to admit&mdash;gave up on the third position that she could not win. Olive came home and proved us all wrong. I must say how delighted we were that she had proved us wrong. She had won from No. 3 on the first occasion she stood, because there was a double dissolution in which she went to No. 5. She finished her political career with really the only time Labor has won the third position in that sort of a contest in Victoria since the 1940s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was also a resident of Port Melbourne and Port Melbourne has lost a great patron. But I hope many of the local issues that she pursued will continue to be pursued by everyone in this chamber. It is true that we were in different factions of the Labor Party, but I can honestly say that in the 12 years she was in Canberra she was an ornament to the Labor Party and an ornament to her own beliefs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the late Senator Olive Zakharov. I did not know Olive very well in a political sense in this place but I had the opportunity to work with her on a number of committees. Also, in the early days that I was here we lived in the same neighbourhood in Canberra and I had the good opportunity occasionally to share a Comcar with her of an evening going home. I think it was very indicative that usually the first conversation that Senator Zakharov made with you was an inquiry about your family. It was always very personal. I found Senator Zakharov to be a genuine and compassionate conversationalist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people that will probably almost miss her the most are the Comcar drivers. In the past three weeks on just about every occasion that I have got into a Comcar the driver has made an inquiry of me as to whether I knew anything relating to Senator Zakharov's health.

She certainly had a close affinity with the many Aborigines who lived in Jabiru in the Kakadu region. Whether it was a matter of resources, environment or Aboriginal social issues, Senator Zakharov took the time to go and talk to those constituents in the Northern Territory and to find out the real issues and how they affected them. I am sure that then she reflected exactly what they had said and their conversations in the work that she participated in here in this parliament.

One thing that probably is becoming increasingly rare in politics in this day and age is to find a person as idealistic as Olive Zakharov was. She really was an idealist who combined her strong beliefs with a genuine  commitment to political activism and sheer hard work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that a lot of her political beliefs were shaped by her own life experiences, certainly her sense of justice and fairness, which she spoke of to so many of us for so long. I think that when she stood up in the Senate chamber, when she stood up in Senate committees, when she talked in the party caucus, when she spoke in faction meetings and talked about issues such as the position of single-parent families in our community she could do it from a personal perspective and her commitment to women's issues. She could do it as someone who had really been there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When she stood up for people in need of social and community services Olive Zakharov really knew what she was talking about. When she defended an individual's right to education, again she was someone who had been there. She was someone who knew what it was like to battle to gain the qualifications to allow a person to really get ahead in life. Olive Zakharov was an extraordinarily committed member of the Labor Party. She really did believe that the quality of a society should be judged on the position that the least empowered people in that society found themselves in. She believed that those people really did deserve a strong voice in the Labor Party and a strong voice in parliament. I believe she gave them that voice. Yes, she was a gentle person, as so many have said, but I think she was a very determined and very persuasive person also. She really did take the issues on and argue them out, and she knew the importance of these issues to ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came into the parliament in 1989, I was on the community affairs committee with Olive.

I think we owe her a great debt of gratitude for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was genuinely a great loyalist to the government, a great loyalist to the Labor Party and, as a couple of speakers have said, a great loyalist to the left of the party. I appreciate that she was standing in what is perhaps a much smaller part of the left wing corner of the chamber than the one where Senator Childs is&mdash;and I got that in quickly, Senator Ray&mdash;but she was a loyalist to her faction and a very important contributor to the left of the Labor Party, not only in the forum of the federal parliament but elsewhere, and we really appreciated that. As the minister for the environment, I noticed that she really did have a great interest in environmental issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During almost all of the time I have been here, most of the time I spent in the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has been spent in the company of Olive Zakharov. I was fortunate to travel to many parts of Australia in her company. She was a wonderful travelling companion because she was able to express a great general knowledge.

We also had some light hearted exchanges over late meals that were far from family and home. As many speakers have confirmed, her family was often at the forefront of her conversations and she often inquired about our families, our welfare, what we were doing, why we were doing it and what our aspirations were. They were well intentioned and well appreciated inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive was not one to stand on ceremony in any fashion. I recall one anecdote that particularly reminds me of what Olive was about.

I quietly said to Olive, `Perhaps you would like to move your jacket from the chair because the balance is not right and the jacket is inappropriate.' As soon as I had said it I knew I had said the wrong thing. This was entirely inappropriate. Olive's response was, `Don't worry about that, Robert.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think she would mind me reminding the Senate that she had a particular speech pattern which included a nervous chuckle at the end of her statements. It occurred when she was being particularly determined, whether she was questioning somebody in a determined manner as part of her committee duties or whether she felt the need to press her position a little more strongly in deciding what should be contained in a committee report. I recall that particular speech pattern. I remind senators that when that came from Olive Zakharov it was a warning. It meant that she was determined and trying politely and without rancour to pursue her point of view. To me that was Olive. She was quietly and politely determined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The life, the works and the sudden passing of Senator Zakharov give us all cause to consider how frail our existence is. One of the great things about Olive Zakharov was that she had a unique opportunity, which we in this place at least have the chance to share, of putting into practice her principles and her beliefs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the benefit of sharing five years with Olive Zakharov on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I note that Senator Colston is seeking the call on the other side. I am sure he will mention her membership of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to say this about Senator Zakharov: although we came from opposite ends of the spectrum, when we were working on that committee you knew that everything she said and everything she did was governed by commitment to the dignity and the rights of the individual. Her work on that committee has been invaluable. Her sharpness of mind, which was indeed considerable, aided the work of the committee. Thousands of Australians have benefited from Senator Zakharov standing up for their rights in the forum of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot comment on all the other areas of Senator Zakharov's concern. I do not have first-hand knowledge of them. But I think the important thing is this: Senator Zakharov was somebody who genuinely translated beliefs and principles into action. As a result of her work, other Australians are the better. In the brief time that we all have here, that is something to which all honourable senators probably aspire. Many perhaps will not do it as well as Senator Zakharov. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate myself also with the condolence motion moved today. I am not sure when I first met Olive, both of us having been around the Labor Party for over 20 years now, but I certainly recall meeting her in 1983 when we both were standing as Senate candidates, she successfully and me unsuccessfully. I knew her when I worked on the staff of a member of the other house and from her commitment to the status of women committee. I really started to get to know Olive when I was here briefly in 1987, but learnt to know her and learnt to love her on my return in 1990 when I shared a lot of committees with her. Her committee work has been alluded to previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I learnt about Olive was her clear vision of what was right and what was wrong. She was never afraid to take a stance on a position nor to justify it, but she always tempered that with respect for others who hold a different point of view. She would argue the point but never the person. Working with her gave me the privilege of knowing a truly loyal and humble person who sought for herself nothing, but sought everything for her fellow human being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place&mdash;a place with considerable egos&mdash;there are a number who play the press gallery and there are some who measure their performances by the column inches they receive. This was never the case with Olive. Despite not being a media junkie, she was known and respected by a very diverse range of people. Since her accident, every time I have travelled in a Comcar, the driver has asked, `How is Senator Zakharov?' and said `We all love her.' The same is true of the people working in the dining rooms and everywhere else. The Comcar drivers said that it did not matter what time of the day or night she hopped into a car or what sort of a day she had had&mdash;it could have been one of those absolutely horrible days when all we do in here is fight and scratch and spit and scream at one another&mdash;Olive would be polite and courteous. She never took her bad days out on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represented Minister Carmen Lawrence at a nursing home opening in Temora 10 days ago. The architects involved in the construction of this building were from Victoria. One of the principals of the firm was there at the opening and, as soon as he got an opportunity, he inquired after Olive's condition. It transpires that his firm had been involved in the construction of a number of nursing homes throughout a very wide area of Victoria. From conversations that he had had with Olive at so many of the openings that she attended, he was very much aware of her commitment to aged care and her commitment to the care of people with disabilities. He asked me to pass on to her family and to her staff his thoughts and best wishes, which I have certainly done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Olive to whom my staff turned in December 1993 when my husband suddenly died. I will never be fully aware of the support and care that she gave to them, but I know that they are very upset today. Her staff are also very special people. They ran Olive's office in a manner which epitomised her attitude to life and her caring for so many people, including us. Her support to me and my staff during that time can never be repaid. For that, we shall be eternally grateful. All I can do today is to publicly say, `Thank you, Olive.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall also never forget my birthday last year, the first one after Peter's death. I thought it was going to be a sad and lonely day. I will never forget receiving a phone call from Olive asking whether she could have an appointment to see me, as her committee chair, in her office at 10 o'clock that morning. It was a little strange. I did not think much of it, but I said that I would go there later that morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier that morning, I got a hint that something was a bit funny, but assumed that my caucus sisters and staff were probably planning a bit of a surprise. No-one can imagine my surprise when I walked into her office to find it all decorated with balloons and signs&mdash;the whole bit&mdash;with nearly half the members of the caucus, caucus committee staff as well as my two stepdaughters and three grandchildren there. Olive was more than happy to have her office disrupted to enable people to support me. That was typical of Olive. That gesture meant a lot to me. She helped turn what would have been a sad and lonely day into one I shall never forget. I know that Vicki, Helen and the three grandchildren would want to pass on to Olive's family and her staff their thanks for being able to share that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Olive brought to this place a great depth of knowledge of the university of life. She had academic qualifications, but she had also experienced life to the fullest, and not necessarily the nicest sides of life. That knowledge, commonsense and experience that she brought here are things that we and the general community should be grateful for, because it tempered her approach to legislation and brought to it a commonsense approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two quotes in her maiden speech which I think epitomise what Olive stood for. The first is her quote of the great English socialist RH Tawney:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Freedom, to be complete, must carry with it not merely the absence of repression, but also the opportunity of self-organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>To all those small organisations and her support for them, Olive epitomised and lived that piece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also said that her favourite piece of Shakespeare was in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hamlet</EMPHASIS>, which she paraphrased. It epitomised her personal philosophy. It was this:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it must follow, as the night the day,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thou canst not then be false to any man.</PARA>
<PARA>She added to this the word `woman'. Olive, you were true to yourself. You were never false to anybody. No-one can ask more than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My thoughts are with her children&mdash;Robin, Martin and Jeannie&mdash;her sister and other family members and especially to Thomas, her grandson, because he will never grow up to know her and see her influence. My thoughts are also with Olive's staff, who are as loving and caring to everybody as she was. We have all lost a very true friend, and the world is a little poorer for her passing. </PARA>

Both were working overseas. Olive took the opportunity of seeing Jeannie in the UK and Martin in Austria. I cannot recall meeting Robin, but Olive spoke warmly about all her family, often when we were having dinner together in Parliament House.

You would have to say, `What would a Liberal Party senator from Tasmania have in common with a left Labor Party senator from Victoria?' It is a lot more than I thought after spending two years with Olive on the employment, education and training committee and working through one particular report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS> on adult education.

I can remember that after waiting two hours outside of the Grosvenor Hotel with Olive she had some wonderful thoughts about Comcar!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard a lot of people talk today about Olive's independence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to say a few things about Olive Zakharov. To describe her as a sincere person is one thing, but I think we need to describe her as a lot more. `A sincere, relentless battler for the powerless and the dispossessed'is something that everyone has said in one way or another during the course of the last two hours on this condolence motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was a fighter for the dignity of the individual. She was a fighter for and defender of diversity and she was a fighter for the protection of heritage. All of those issues she came to, not just with an understanding drawn out of her professional understanding and learning, but because of the experiences she had in life. She understood when she spoke about the need to protect diversity and to protect the dignity of individuals. She had suffered and experienced it in her personal life and she had the courage to front it there and in her public life, and to front it in a way that quite often meant she was a pioneer in some of the issues she pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was driven by that idealism and integrity. As some speakers have mentioned, the sense of humour also came out from time to time. You knew she was probably at her toughest when she did, as Senator Bell said, have that chuckle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the one thing that permeates all the contributions made about Olive and permeated Olive's whole life here was that she never lost that contact with individuals in the community, community organisations and their causes. In fact, the last day of her consciousness epitomises her life and her battles. I actually met her on that Sunday morning. Brian Howe and I had launched the second stage of the citizenship campaign at Station Pier. Olive came up at the end. She was puffing and a bit hot and flustered and I said, `What's wrong?' She said, `I have just run from home. I don't live too far away. I heard on the news that you were here and we have got to do something to protect the seamen's union building. We have to protect this precinct.' She had obviously just run from home to there to try to achieve some publicity for it. That is what she said she wanted to do. She wanted to save the building. She wanted to protect the history of that site and she went on to lobby the media on that very same morning of the day she was run over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That building, in a sense, does represent the sorts of things Olive fought for all the way through. It represents the struggle of workers and their families and it represents her commitment to heritage issues. It also reflects the local and international coming together in that commitment she showed on the last morning. We have been told about the gay and lesbian network function she went to in the afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one of my earliest memories of her was of her performance, her contribution and her commitment&mdash;in fact, I found it inspirational&mdash;on the issue of Kakadu. She made endless speeches in here and she travelled the country with respect to the spiritual rights of the Jawoyn people and the rights of indigenous Australians. If I could remember once when I saw Olive frustrated and angry, it was during that battle. I think very few in this place and the other place understood to the extent that she did the spiritual rights of indigenous Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was long before the cabinet took on the decision to protect the site at Kakadu, the Jawoyn site at Coronation Hill, that she had travelled the country and made speeches. Whilst a lone battler for a while, she just took on that cause no matter what the odds. I must say I was gratified a few years later when I went to Kakadu to meet with the elders and they had great respect and regard for her and remembered her. I think in the same way as they remember her, many others in society will too. I would like to express my condolences to her family, staff and friends on what we see as the passing of a very special person. </PARA>

But that was not Olive's position. She fought not only to uplift herself by way of education, by way of activity, by way of doing things but also to take the rest of the community with her. I believe that is the measure of Olive Zakharov. She fought against all those elements for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have talked about her sense of loyalty to people within her political party and to organisations in which she was active. I believe her first loyalty was to the people out there in the community who were unable to help themselves, who did not help themselves and who needed her work and her activity very badly and were given it in great measure. As a result of using organisations as a tool&mdash;organisations like the peace movement, the Labor Party, the Labor government, the parliament itself&mdash;and working with other people to achieve the goals that she saw as important, she did have that sort of loyalty, she did have that sort of compassion for others, and she did have a great deal of concern about the way in which she was active in helping those people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When new members of parliament arrive, they experience a feeling of confusion and are a bit lost for a while as they come to grips with the procedures of the committees and the chambers. I recall being asked very early by the whip what committees I wanted to go on. I was also told, `Don't hold your breath that you will get on the ones that you select.' But I was indeed fortunate to be appointed as a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It was there that I very quickly recognised all of those qualities of patience, tolerance, commitment, knowledge and understanding that characterised Senator Zakharov. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly appreciated the fact that I was able to have a cup of coffee with Senator Zakharov after a committee meeting while she explained various procedures as to how the system worked.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall, as Senator Bell has mentioned, our travels around the country last year in the open learning inquiry. I know that Senator Bell will recall our visit to the Yuendumu Aboriginal station. It did not get as much publicity as a visit a week earlier by another member of parliament, but it was certainly a most worthwhile visit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The passing of a dear and valued colleague always raises in one's mind the question of mortality in general and one's own mortality in particular. I have several thoughts in relation to the passing of Olive Zakharov. The first is that&mdash;and I am reflecting here on what Senator Bryant Burns has just said&mdash;each generation essentially represents an extremely thin slice of the totality of humanity, and each individual an even smaller slice than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose when one looks at the shortness of a human life, one looks at whether a person has utilised the society as it is, exploited the society as it is and passed on perhaps leaving the world in a poorer shape&mdash;whether one has been a freeloader&mdash;or whether one has, indeed, made an incremental improvement so that the next generation has a marginally better circumstance than the one into which that person was born. I think, in that respect, one must say that Olive Zakharov was very true to her principles and was very consistent. She showed a very high level of integrity and did everything that she possibly could to ensure that the world that she left behind would be a marginally better world than the world into which she was born and, in that, she succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thought that arises in my mind is that, throughout the course of a life, one is born, one lives and one dies. We all go through those phases. In learning how we might approach life, we are often given lessons by our elders. I am reminded of the following words that Kipling wrote to his young son:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the comments which have already been made and to add briefly to them. One of the best ways of getting to know fellow senators is to travel with them on delegations or on committee inquiries. I had the privilege of travelling to Europe with Senator Zakharov in July 1991, to which Senator Colston has already alluded. She was a very good travelling companion, actively involved at all times with a clear idea of what she wanted to achieve and, I believe, generally achieving it. She provided a much needed countervailing influence to the inevitable and, I suppose, necessary trade and economic focus that most of our delegations take when travelling. Senator Zakharov insisted on broadening this view to include social and cultural concerns. She was recently selected to be part of a delegation which I will be leading to Canada and the United States in April. Already in the meetings that we have had, the preparatory ones that she was able to attend, she had influenced the delegates' focus again to broaden and human</PARA></TALK.START>

I also enjoyed the privilege of serving on committees with Senator Zakharov, most recently on the Joint House Committee and a subcommittee that we set up to oversee the new art acquisition program, which she was very keen on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of these associations, I found her to be not only honest and principled, as everybody has already attested to, but also refreshingly young and modern in her outlook, despite her years.

She was devoid of the ego which drives so many&mdash;dare I say, particularly in this place.
