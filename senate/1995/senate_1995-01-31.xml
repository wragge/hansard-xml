<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to a third generation logging contractor possibly sitting in the Senate today wondering whether he will have any work when he returns to Wandandian tomorrow. He has 25 employees, $3 million worth of equipment and is typical of seven or eight other logging contractors servicing six timber mills between Nowra and Bega. I ask the minister: does he realise that each one percentage point increase in interest rates costs that man and his business an estimated $10,000 and that the government has forced up official interest rates by 58 per cent in the last five months? Does the minister also realise how his government's confused logging policy is adding uncertainty to that logging contractor's business? What does the minister say to that particular logging contractor about the government's intention to now impose a so-called carbon tax, which will simply be a further tax on the fuel that this contractor needs to run a profitable business? I ask the minister: how does the government expect Australian businesses to survive, let alone prosper, with such foolish and confused policies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing confusing about the government's position so far as logging is concerned. The Prime Minister's statement was a straight down the line recognition of the reality that there are two major competing interests in issue in this country&mdash;the issue that is of deep concern to a very large number of members of the community about saving native forests and which not only is a matter for the Commonwealth government and its export woodchips policy but also is very much a matter, so far as the logging itself is concerned, of the responsibility of state govern ments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time people woke up to the fact that the basic responsibility for determining the future of this industry&mdash;whether it does or does not survive, or in what form or to what extent it survives&mdash;is very much a matter for the state governments. You put some of the heat upon them rather than just upon the Commonwealth. What we have been trying to do as part of the national forest policy strategy is get people together, get a rational assessment of the matters in issue and get a rational balance between not only the interest in the environment and saving native forests but also the interest that is so clearly and starkly there in preserving employment in this country and doing nothing unnecessary to undermine it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are acutely conscious of that side of the equation as well as the environmental one. That is why it is such a difficult issue and it is not dealt with sensibly by the kind of noisy malarky we hear from the other side of the chamber on this particular issue. I hope that, if we are going to see a new and sensible approach on policy issues from the other side, we will get a better recognition of the difficulty of drawing this kind of balance in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of a carbon tax or any other fiscal policy change that might be involved, that is of course something that is utterly unresolved at this stage. It is the subject of some discussion obviously within the government&mdash;as you would expect, given the nature of the fiscal issues that are confronting the country at the moment and the nature of the environmental responsibilities we have&mdash;but certainly no decision of any kind has been made, and we are acutely conscious of the employment and the economic implications of going down that path in any very substantial way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of interest rates which was also raised, the situation is, of course, that you have to be sensible when an economy is coming out of recession to ensure that the growth that is generated by that is sustainable growth; that when you come to the traffic lights you can keep going, you do not have to come to a shuddering stop. You have to adjust the speed of the economy so the lights are always green, so that you can always keep going. That is why, of course, we have had a series of small changes, small increases in interest rates&mdash;to reflect the reality of an economy coming out of recession, surging with growth, surging with capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need accordingly to ensure, particularly given the lead times that are involved in these judgments, that the economy does not move so fast that it is necessary to over correct and produce a stop. That is why interest rates have been rising. The hope, of course, is that the overall situation of the economy, the demand side of the equation, is slowing down. There is some evidence for that. It is to be hoped certainly, as most commentators have been saying, that the nature of the economic situation and the nature of the government's response to it so far, is such that it will not be necessary to go further in any very drastic way down that particular path. That is a matter about which you cannot make premature judgments. Any responsible government recognises that and any responsible opposition should do the same.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. It is only this minister that would tell Australian business that it can cop a small interest rate increase, which is a 58 percent increase in five months. It just demonstrates how out of touch the government is. The real question is: does the government really understand what its policies are cumulatively doing to Australian business? You are forcing up interest rates; you are now seeking to impose upon them new taxes on production; and, in the case of this particular industry, you have added a confused logging policy. Does this government not understand that small business in particular cannot grow, cannot prosper and cannot employ in that sort of environment? When is this government going to face the realities of what it is doing to Australian business, rather than giving the sort of airy-fairy academic answer that has just been given by the minister today?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian business, big, medium and small, is flourishing immensely more in an environment where, in the last September quarter, growth was running at 6.4 percent, underlying inflation at less than two per cent, and unemployment at under nine percent. They are running immensely more strongly than a time when the current Leader of the Opposition was sitting in the chair producing 10 percent inflation, growth of never more than two or three per cent, and, at the end of his tenure, unemployment of 11 percent. That is the comparison you should be conscious of, and that is what you should recognise so far as this government's achievement is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, and relates to an industry brief released last week by the Bureau of Industry Economics. This publication outlined that there is extremely strong employment growth in the services sector with some 420,000 jobs being created in service industries over the last two years. Against this background, can the minister advise the Senate of how the manufacturing sector is currently faring and indicate whether it, too, is exhibiting continued growth?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should thank Senator Colston for his question because it enables me to give some more and better particulars to the headline answer Senator Evans just gave to the opposition. The figures from a range of various statistical sources on manufacturing performance in Australia make the manufacturing sector in this country the stand-out performer in the Australian economy. Over the last two years, it has seen the strongest ever sustained growth in manufacturing production since the Australian Bureau of Statistics commenced collecting figures. We have done better in the last two years than ever before according to the bureau, which commenced the collection of figures in 1974.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Production increased by 12.2 per cent per year to the September quarter of last year. This has taken the surge of production to 12.5 per cent above the record in the June quarter of 1989. We are now at the highest ever level of growth in manufacturing industry production. The manufacturing sector has directly contributed 23.6 per cent of total growth in the Australian economy since 1991. That is an outstanding performance, when one considers that it represents only 16 per cent of gross production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at investment as an indicator of future trends, one sees that in this section of the economy investment has been surging and is a foundation for continuing growth. Manufacturing investment went up by 10.3 per cent seasonally adjusted for the September quarter last year. Growth over the last four quarters represents 26.9 per cent&mdash;that is the year on growth&mdash;a huge amount of investment growth. The bureau's forward surveys suggest that these trends are set to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the export performance of this section of the economy, one can see an equally impressive performance. Manufacturing exports have gone up by 9.9 per cent each year in real terms since 1986 and 1987. Elaborately transformed manufactures, the most complex and sophisticated manufactured goods, have gone up the most. They have gone up by 17 per cent per year over the decade, which puts Australia as the best performed country in the OECD in terms of the growth in elaborately transformed manufactures. We now earn $11 billion from the export of elaborately transformed manufactures. We earned $2 billion just over a decade ago. This is set to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement last week by Mitsubishi Motors Australia that it has been selected as a world source for the next generation family sedan car indicates a great deal of confidence in the Australian manufacturing sector, and the Australian automotive sector specifically. Our quality is up, our prices are competitive and design and other inputs put us on the world stage as a leading player. It is evidence, too, that the government's policies in manufacturing development are working. The Button car plan is effective. It is also a compliment to the companies which have performed in this sector, particularly Mitsubishi which has adopted best practice guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other surveys out which indicate what the future trends will be&mdash;the Chamber of Manufactures survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends. They come to these conclusions: strong growth went through in the December quarter; higher production levels were reported; significant increase in production is expected by most of the companies in the field; and profits and investment in plant and equipment are expected to remain high&mdash;a strong performing sector in the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have indicated, I believe that the decision announced by the Prime Minister in both his statements of 22 December last year and of 27 January this year represents a very balanced outcome on this issue and also a very good result for the environment. The 509 coupes and compartments that Senator Sandy Macdonald asked me about were selected from 1,300 that were covered by my original advice to Mr Beddall, the national estate areas covered by a section 30 advice which was supplied by the Australian Heritage Commission and a very small number for which more recent information has become available.

You will simply stop all further clearing for agriculture in Australia&mdash;some members of the National Party might have views about that that they clearly have not been able to express&mdash;purely on the basis that it will be a contribution to eliminating greenhouse gases. You can argue validly for stopping clearing or, indeed, for reafforesting the 15 per cent of currently cleared land that has been claimed by the coalition it will reafforest as a habitat for flora and fauna, and for a whole range of other valid reasons.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You might be pleased to hear this, Senator Kemp. Research in Victoria carried out by the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has demonstrated very clearly that soil, properly managed, is capable of sequestering more carbon than trees are. In fact, the solution&mdash;and it should be adopted&mdash;is whole farm management practices, particularly things like minimum tillage. If the land is properly managed, organic carbon levels in soil can actually be built up to a greater extent than they can in trees. The Victorian agricultural department has shown only too clearly that that in turn results in more productive cropping. So it is an absolute win-win situation. I notice Senator Brownhill nodding in assent. It is true: if you manage the land properly, you will not only absorb more carbon into the soil but you will actually get better cropping and better production as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this an entirely fallacious policy on agricultural grounds, but it is also totally uncosted. Mr McLachlan said in the policy that to do this would be `both simple and inexpensive'. He based this on the South Australian process, which I have to say is excellent, of compensating landowners for taking land out of production and, in fact, not clearing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current cost of that program&mdash;I have checked with South Australia&mdash;is around $120 per hectare. Translating that into a national policy, how the coalition can say in print that this will be both simple and inexpensive is beyond me. As I have pointed out already, the cost of implementing the reafforestation of 660,000 hectares of currently cleared land every year that it has targeted would be between $5 billion, using direct seeding, and about $15 billion, using plants. So the government, in pure fiscal terms, will not be adopting that either.</PARA>

Those hopes have not been realised.</PARA></TALK.START>

Many political prisoners remain incarcerated. Political and civil freedoms are effectively non-existent. Forced labour is still a reality in many parts of the country. So far as minorities are concerned, the offensive against the Karen National Union, about which Senator Bourne asked, which the Australian government deplores and which has now already resulted in the fall of Manerplaw, has called in question any real commitment by the SLORC administration to reconciliation with the minorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government's policy under these circumstances is to continue to apply every conceivable form of pressure or encouragement or persuasion that we can that is likely to be effective, to try and get movement against a number of benchmarks that we have articulated. That approach has largely found common acceptance not only with the United States and Europe but also with the ASEAN countries, which are very much more influential than any of us in Myanmar, at the discussions we had earlier last year. Australia's position on trade and economic relations has led us to take the approach of neither encouraging nor discouraging trade and investment but holding out the prospect of more active support for trade and investment if again movement is made on those benchmarks.</PARA>

I was not aware of the visit until after it had occurred. Mr Hawke did, however, seek and receive standard briefing from my department earlier in January before the visit when he indicated to them that he was about to go. Had I known that he was going there I would have expressed no basic objection to the visit itself for exploring commercial opportunities. To have done so would have been to discriminate in a way that we have not done with other business firms that have indicated a desire to go there and see the opportunities. As I said, we neither encourage nor discourage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister announced last week, the government will do everything in its power to ensure the protection of those 509 coupes, until their values are properly assessed as part of the national reserve system through a regional forest agreement. The Minister for Resources is writing to woodchip companies and state governments to inform them of the areas that the government intends to protect, and the 222 national estate areas are explicitly protected in terms of the licence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the states have primary responsibility for the management of forests and, as the Prime Minister has indicated, the government wishes to work cooperatively with the states to find the most effective way to end logging in the 509 high conservation value coupes. The mainland states, of course, have accepted an obligation, in signing the national forest policy statement, to protect forest areas likely to be of high conservation value until such time as those values can be thoroughly assessed, a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system put in place and a system of forest reserves established. I think it is time that the states joined with the Commonwealth in honouring that obligation of the national forest policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subject to the outcome of consultations with the states, it is anticipated that the principal means of protection for these coupes will be through conditions that are attached to the new licences. Of course, that will depend on the companies giving up their current licences, according to the processes that the Prime Minister outlined in his statement of 27 January. The Prime Minister has invited them to do so in order to remove the uncertainty that has been created by the Federal Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is in the best interests of all parties involved in this issue that they respond positively to the invitation the Prime Minister has issued. State agencies will need to reschedule their planned logging activities to avoid the nominated coupes. If after such rescheduling the resources available to industry are inadequate, the government has indicated that it will work in consultation with the industry, the unions and the states to assess the need for industry assistance.</PARA>

Does the list also include compartment 48 in the Barrington Tops State Forest and is it true that 80 hectares of the area was ringbarked in the 1950s? Is it also a fact that large parts have been regularly burnt and grazed and the remainder have been extensively logged in the past?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Alston has shown his ignorance of the national forest policy statement. For your information, Senator Alston, there are more values than just old-growth and wilderness, and that is outlined in the national forest policy statement. I think most Australians would believe that many of those values are important. National Estate values are important; World Heritage values are important; bio-diversity values are important; and endangered species values are important. I point out to you, Senator, that on page 24 of the national forest policy statement, dealing with comprehensive regional assessments, those values are outlined very clearly. I will quote the NFPS for Senator Alston's information. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

That is true. But Mr Souris fails to acknowledge the fact that the quarry in question is very small and the compartment in which it is situated is, by comparison, extraordinarily large. He has claimed that a very high proportion of the 1,300 forest coupes, originally identified by my department in December, were previously being logged.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding the opposition's interjections, this is a program that has widespread support amongst state governments and the private sector. It is a straightforward team Australia proposal which this morning reflected that cooperative approach in a meeting of the Market Australia Advisory Group. The meeting was attended by myself and my colleague Peter Cook, representing the federal government, Hendy Cowan from Western Australia, David Hamill from Queensland, Phillip Gude from Victoria and Shane Stone from the Northern Territory, together with representatives of other Commonwealth government agencies and representatives of the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Market Australia initiative had its origins in the McKinsey report on behalf of the Australian Manufacturing Council about emerging exporters. The report identified a concern for Australian companies, particularly small to medium enterprises, and identified the need to raise international perceptions&mdash;by implication, particularly in our region&mdash;about Australia's capacity in the manufacture of sophisticated goods and the provision of sophisticated services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some delay in the commencement of that program to enable research to be undertaken because I did not wish&mdash;and the other ministers and representatives shared the view&mdash;to respond merely to an assessment as general as that from McKinsey, so we undertook a research campaign in seven markets in the Asian region which substantially reinforced the concerns which McKinsey outlined and gave some indications of the sort of campaign we ought to undertake to deal with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matters we dealt with this morning particularly related to marketing campaigns conducted essentially by the Commonwealth but with the cooperation of, and some funding from, the private sector to seek to change those images. It is a truism of any sort of marketing that images are quick to form and slow to change. But it is important to have a campaign to start the process of change. This morning's meeting decided to test the marketing concept in selected markets, particularly China, Indonesia and Thailand. We will be looking at some sector specific activity probably in the Republic of Korea.</PARA>

It has already got under way campaigns in association with the private sector to promote Australia's skills in rural telecommunications, aerospace and environmental technology.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advisory group proposed quite forcefully&mdash;and I think accurately&mdash;that there need to be sets of performance  indicators against which the success of the campaign can be measured. It is not intended that it should be funded by the public sector as a long-term proposal. It is intended that we will seek to show whether a strategy such as this can succeed and, if it can, we hope that it will then be taken up by the private sector. We will be having discussions later this year and early next year about initiatives to encourage the private sector to take up this proposal when the government commitment to it concludes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is an important and appropriate initiative. It is the sort of thing that the public sector should initiate briefly as a catalyst in concert with Commonwealth, states and the private sector in the hope that, if it succeeds, it will become a continuing feature of Australian market performance subsequently funded by the private sector.

<PARA>I point out to the Senate that the reason for my raising this particular matter was not to make a great point of the tardiness of the answer, nor to be concerned in particular about the other question which is unanswered, but, rather, to point out that question on notice No. 1893 was of the same ilk as the question without notice I asked today. In other words, it was a question about the process that this government has in place with regard to the export of woodchips from this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the edification of honourable senators, question on notice No. 1893 pointed out that alleged breaches of prescription in compartment 13 of Croobyar State Forest had come to our notice. We alleged that activities were taking place which were not in accordance with the national forest policy statement. We therefore asked: what is the forestry policy statement worth if breaches could be noticed on 22 November 1994? We wanted to know what was being done about it and whether a new licence would be issued to these people if such breaches were in fact found to have occurred. The fact that it has taken so long is not really the issue. The real issue is that we are concerned&mdash;and the Democrats have a right to be concerned&mdash;about the forest policy statement. We want to know whether the government is serious about enforcing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the fact that Minister Collins, in his answer to my question without notice, was able to say that there is an increased supervision of the terms and conditions of these licences. But, in the case of 27 November, we would have thought that there would be some sort of response to suggest that this government is serious about policing its own policies. It is not that we want inspectors hiding behind every tree or people running around in hard hats poking about in other people's business all the time, but we do want some attempt to demonstrate that this government is serious about the terms and conditions that have been established. It has got a policy. Let us see it enforce it. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Faulkner said that the process of nominating the original 1,300 coupes was thorough, rigorous, open, transparent, done with consultation and will stand scrutiny. What hogwash! What absolute nonsense! He knows it and his government knows it. Everyone who has been interested in this matter knows that he and his government deliberately went about sponsoring extreme green groups throughout this land to come up with their nominations. In fact, he gave those groups $120,000 of taxpayers' money to come forward with the 1,300 coupes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He gave them only seven weeks to do it, and so it was done in a very cursory, offhand way. He did not consult with the experts in the states&mdash;and he acknowledged today in this chamber that the state governments are the experts in land management and do in fact hold all the detailed information. Did he consult with them? No, he did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the specifics that Senator Alston asked the minister about and which he failed to answer, let me refer the Senate to a letter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of the 16th of this month by Dr Hans Drielsma, the Managing Director of the State Forest of New South Wales. Dr Drielsma said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is . . . interesting to note, therefore, that in the north-east of NSW, 125 out of 155 areas nominated as having high conservation value (ie, 80 per cent) have been logged at least once previously, presumably destroying their natural values.</PARA>
<PARA>It was the minister himself who said in this chamber just a little while ago that the highest values the government was chasing were for old growth and for wilderness. Dr Drielsma said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the areas, in addition to previous logging, were ringbarked or given . . . silvicultural treatment . . . to encourage good . . . regeneration. Obviously, these treatments have been highly successful.</PARA>
<PARA>The whole thing has been a sham. I refer to a note put out by the Tasmanian government in December. Again, of the 181 areas nominated of the 1,300 that were in Tasmania, planned logging has been completed in 14 of those coupes. Logging is in progress in a further 19 of the coupes. A further 117 have been previously logged for a variety of products, including sawlog, pulpwood, mining timbers and firewood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole thing was a sham, and the minister and the government knows it. It was a deliberate move by the government to try to con suburban Melbourne and Sydney that it was supportive of Green sentiments. The government thought it could play one side of the coin as well as the other by renewing the licences. It thought it could get away with doing that. The demonstration outside this parliament by the people who are directly affected and the demonstrations that have been in Tasmania, Perth and in forest areas all around the nation show that it will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister knows what the solution is. The solution is to get agreement between the Commonwealth and the states as to what are parks and what are multiple-use forests. The minister claimed here today that his process has been open and transparent. He blamed the states for not settling the national forest policy process and ending up with regional agreements. What a load of hogwash. He knows as well as I do that his department and the Greens&mdash;Toyne and Co.&mdash;have been the source of obstruction on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states have tried to get criteria out of the  Commonwealth for this regional assessment process, and they have failed. It really has been a shonky business by the minister. The community of Australia ought to be well aware of that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In December 1993 the cabinet decided that the Minister for the Environment would provide advice to the Minister for Resources on matters relevant to the national forest policy statement as it applied to the granting of woodchip export licences. The process I undertook in developing that advice, I believe, was the most comprehensive, thorough and transparent that has ever been undertaken. It was, however, complicated by a lack of cooperation from state governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All states were advised in July 1994 by DPIE of the Commonwealth's information requirements on the renewal of export licences. The states' response to this request for information was very patchy and in many cases quite late. In fact, a comprehensive list of coupes likely to be logged were only ever received for Tasmania and the southern forests of Western Australia. This made the task of developing advice for Minister Beddall very difficult indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 August the acting environment minister wrote to state ministers informing them of my initiative with the conservation organisations and inviting them to comment and to advise the department on the advice from the conservation organisations when received. This was also made clear and contacted at official levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales and Tasmanian governments responded that they would not cooperate in the assessment process. When reports were received from conservation organisations in early November, they were forwarded to state governments, NAFI, the Forest Protection Society and the CFMEU. They were asked to comment and provide information on any areas to my department. There were almost no responses to that invitation. No analysis was provided on the merits of individual coupe analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My portfolio analysed information from a wide range of sources before making its recommendations to me. As part of that process, the conservation organisations were funded to provide substantiated advice on areas likely to be of high conservation value. My advice in no way was an endorsement of the information provided by the conservation groups. My department undertook its own detailed assessment of the conservation significance of the areas that were planned for logging. It involved itself in a step by step process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The geographic locations of the coupes were checked. The Australian Heritage Commission checked coupes against information that was held on the register of the national estate. This information included the growth stage, the disturbance history and the presence of endangered species in the vegetation communities for the areas concerned. The environmental resources information unit used GIS technology to map the location of coupes with information holdings on nationally threatened species, including rare species of plants obtained from the records of museums, herbaria and botanical gardens around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANCA plotted the location of coupes against information holdings on rare and threatened species and communities, wetlands of significance and migratory paths of birds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation status of forest communities was checked by the portfolio against all the available information. Where it was considered to be poorly reserved, the area was also listed as likely to be of high conservation value. Analysis was undertaken on habitat requirements and strategies that needed to be put in place for protection of species listed in the Endangered Species Protection Act. The AHC was also involved in analysing the information against the national wilderness inventory. This represents a very thorough and detailed process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join this debate very briefly and for one reason: to put paid to the lies that have been perpetrated by the green lobby movement around Australia, particularly around Western Australia, during the last few months. This has led to the fiasco of the cancellation of those licences, and that is why we see the ring of trucks outside. It is good to see a display of the machinery that we have in the forests, but it is very unfortunate that those machines are not in the forests working and earning foreign export income for Australia rather than sitting idly around here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could see the green lobby votes going out the window some time before Christmas, he decided to do something about it and overrode two of his ministers&mdash;Senator Faulkner and Mr Beddall&mdash;cancelling those licences, which had been issued under the national forest agreement almost two years ago. He had to intervene because he could see those green lobby votes disappearing. That is why we have the 509 blocks around Australia locked up. I refuse to call these blocks `coupes'&mdash;I expect chickens to be running out of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effect does this have on Australia's economy? We know what the economy is doing. It means the loss of jobs. It means the loss of jobs and incomes in remote areas&mdash;not around Canberra, not in Senator Faulkner's town and not in Senator Gareth Evans's new electorate of Holt, but out in those remote areas where we cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the lies the Greens put around. If you listened to the Greens&mdash;I half believed it myself for a while&mdash;you would think good, straight, millable karri and jarrah logs were going into woodchipping. That is a lie. That is a plain lie because only five per cent of hardwood forest goes into woodchipping as a by-product. The logs do not go in as a whole. The Democrats are not bad at pushing this lie either. Only five per cent of the hardwood goes in. Otherwise, that material would be left on the forest floor to rot and cause further diseases in the forest or to burn and add more expense. This way it has a value. The Greens say that that is the case. I say it is all lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all states of Australia, public forests are controlled by state authorities. In Western Australia they are controlled by the Department of Conservation and Land Management. It manages the forest. It decides what logs are cut, what logs are not cut and where not to cut. For example, it decided that there would be no cutting for 200 metres on either side of a stream. It decides not to cut on too steep a bank&mdash;anything over 15 degrees, I believe&mdash;whereas a lot of other countries cut on steeper banks. CALM decides all that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It decides what may be cut and then it decides the trees that have to be left behind for natural seed. When it allows the logging, then it appoints the contractors to fell the trees. CALM does that. Private enterprise does not do it&mdash;willy-nilly to make a fast buck. CALM decides. It has its own dedicated contractors. Then it has dedicated contractors to cart those logs to the mill. It sets the price the mill has to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would think that is probably where the control of those logs finishes. But it does not. In Western Australia, the mill has to undertake that 70 per cent of first-grade, hardwood timber logs go to value adding, which puts paid to the argument of Mr de Bruin of the South Australian softwood industry. He said last night on television that 90 per cent finishes up in housing. That is a lie also. He is only protecting the softwood industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could debate for a lot longer than five minutes on this matter, but the lies the Greens are perpetrating are what caused the Prime Minister to come in to save the green lobby votes for himself for the next election by overriding the licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the green lobby group and the Democrats have a message, let them tell the truth. They should tell the truth about what happens. I know what goes on in the forests of Western Australia. I have made a good study of it and I know what is going on. The two Greens are missing today. Sorry, three Greens are missing today&mdash;there is a new one&mdash;but we hope they will come in and join this debate in time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too rise to speak on Senator Gibson's motion to take note of Senator Faulkner's answer to Senator Alston's question on coupes. I note that the question referred specifically to New South Wales. But in his answer the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) wandered all over the place, as he has done also in his comments here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to make reference to some Western Australian aspects. In particular, I want to pick up the point made by Senator Harradine about certainty before the law and also that there must be some ability by people who deal with governments to have faith in government statements&mdash;ministerial statements, in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with Western Australia, I refer in particular to the 1992 AHC-CALM agreement. At that time the then minister, Mrs Kelly, heralded that agreement by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe this is an outstanding example of the way in which federal and State agencies can work together for common good . . . I hope it's the beginning of a new relationship between forest industries and State governments.</PARA>
<PARA>She further went on there to say that this would improve the productivity in the forest sector while conserving the National Estate. At the time this was supported, might I add, by Senator Coulter, the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, by Senator Chaney, who was the environmental spokesman for the opposition, and by a number of other people, including some from the Green movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a situation where that has been thrown out the door. It is indeed unfortunate that both Senator Collins and Senator Faulkner have chosen to leave the chamber, but I note that the Leader of the Government, Senator Gareth Evans, is here. I put the fact that we are already seeing the fallout of this particular decision with the uncertainty that is apparent here: Whittakers, one of the operators in Western Australia, has applied to the Stock Exchange to suspend trading of its shares and this has been granted. This is the sort of thing that happens when we have a government that is inconsistent in its policy position and does not know where it is travelling. There is conflict between Senator Collins, Senator Faulkner and Minister Beddall in the other place. We now have the intervention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As a result we have thousands and thousands of jobs at risk, with the flow-on effects of that into our current account, higher national debt, higher interest rates and all other things flowing from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to say to those sitting on the other side in relation to this is that if they are going to change the rules of the game, if they are going to say that they no longer have faith in what the Australian Heritage Commission did in 1992 in making the assessment in terms of the Western Australian forest&mdash;if they no longer have faith in that decision and the identification process that went on then, then they should damn well come out and say so. They should just be a little bit honest about it. They should not hide under it and undermine the industry, undermine the people involved in it, mislead the people who are genuinely concerned about conservation values, undermine the work that has been done by the conservation and land management division in Western Australia and totally confuse everybody in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the challenge that this government has to answer as to why it has changed its particular position. It certainly cannot be for conservation reasons. It certainly is not because of the management of the particular operations that go on there, whether it be saw-milling or&mdash;as Senator Panizza said&mdash;picking up the residue of that saw-milling and utilising it for chipping and earning export dollars. It is all about the government's political position and how it perceives it can buy votes. It is not about the best interests of Australia. It is not about the best interests of the particular states involved in it. It is not about honouring agreements which have been put in place, as I have mentioned, between the Australian Heritage Commission and the conservation and land management department in Western Australia. In fact, it is a total no confidence vote in those entities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in terms of identifying the `coupes', as they are called in Western Australia, one must ask why the government got a list from the conservation council but never bothered to refer those on the list to the conservation and land management division and, as I understand it&mdash;but I cannot be certain about this&mdash;nor did the government bother to have those identified or assessed by the Australian Heritage Commission. The government has gone back in over the top of the work that was already done in 1992; it has given no valid reason for the action it has taken; and it has thrown an industry, a very successful industry, into chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wind up my remarks by asking: why did Senator Faulkner refuse the invitation to go down and inspect the management programs now occurring in the south-west forest? I think a visit there would be an object lesson to him and to anybody in the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion to take note of the answer by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and congratulate the coalition senators who have spoken before me.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, on an economic basis, this is a multi-billion dollar industry earning vitally needed export dollars for our economy. We know that our balance of trade is blowing out every month with now multi-billion dollar deficits turning in by the month. The one area where the federal government could be redressing that is in the area of providing certainty, as Senator Harradine so eloquently put it, to the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, no, it does not. Why not? Because it has only one agenda. That agenda is to do the work of the conservation movement&mdash;that is, to fund the conservation movement and to give it reports to act upon to close down certain forest coupes. We ought to be aware that the 146 areas of high conservation value in Tasmania, which Senator Faulkner previously listed, were seriously flawed in science. Some 80 per cent of the areas that he nominated in my home state did not qualify under the national forest policy statement definitions of high quality, old-growth and wilderness. Large numbers of the areas nominated had a history of past logging and reafforestation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to this house that it is absolutely essential for sound public policy that there be certainty, that people know the process and that the process is fair and reasonable so that the outcome can be looked upon and accepted by the community at large. What Senator Faulkner has done, on his own admission, is to consult with only the green movement, the conservation groups. To make it easier for them, he threw in $120,000 to assist them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the purpose of that? Well, his predecessor has told the world how the Labor Party operates&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS>.

We in Tasmania had an outrageous government called the Green-Labor accord. It destroyed the economy of our state. The Liberal government is still trying to get Tasmania out of the doldrums created by the Green-Labor accord. The people of Australia ought to be aware that this government is in fact a de facto Green-Labor accord wreaking exactly the same havoc over Australia that the Michael Field/Bob Brown government did to the people of Tasmania. </PARA>

They would continue to destroy the lives of people, their investments, their livelihoods, their families and their communities. That is what this debate is all about. It is about time that the Labor Party put its principles on the line and said to the workers and trade unionists of this country, `We support you before the extreme greenists.' This is its test. It has already failed it. It has the opportunity to redeem itself before the next election. If it does not, I am assured that the workers within regional Australia will absolutely desert the Labor Party and we will regain all those seats that are required to ensure that John Howard becomes the next Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what we are really debating is not actually that but some of the phrases and the slogans which have crept into this&mdash;slogans which have replaced actual discussion and actual information.

That is a very good example of the complicated process that should be undertaken when assessing the value of these particular coupes of forest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a member of a number of conservation bodies, and have been since the mid-1950s, and I make no apology whatsoever for the position taken by the conservation movement over a long period. It is the conservation movement that has been telling the forestry industry and successive governments over many decades that we should get into extensive plantation forestry. I point the finger here at the opposition, which was in government right through the 1950s, the 1960s and into the early 1970s, and then from 1975 to 1983, for its failure to insist that the forestry industry in this country be based on plantation forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the state of South Australia, where we unfortunately chopped down our small amount of forests very early on and established plantation forestry in the 1920s mainly in the south-east of the state, we have and have had for decades the only forestry commission that has been running at a profit. A few moments ago Senator Calvert talked about Tasmania. Doesn't he recall that the Tasmanian government had not so long ago to write off $450 million worth of debt which the Tasmanian Forestry Commission has got itself into because of the total inadequacy of the way it was managing the forests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly sympathetic towards those men and women who work in the forestry industry because at present they are the meat in the sandwich between inadequate government policy over decades and a totally inadequate policy by the forestry commissions and the forestry industries in every state of Australia except South Australia. They are the people who are now being screwed. They are not being screwed by the conservation movement; they are being screwed by the inadequacy of the policies which have been pursued over a long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that has been repeated here today that it is only waste which is going to the chippers is a lie. I have been to many forests and seen exactly what are the operations. I suggest to the opposition that, if it goes and has a look, it will see at least 30 per cent of the timber which is being cut down is being left on the forest floor. I have seen it in Queensland; I have seen it in New South Wales; I have seen it in Victoria; and I have seen it in Tasmania. Again, it is the workers who are being screwed in this because many of them&mdash;they are outside this building with their rigs&mdash;are working on contracts in which they are paid by the tonnage of logs delivered to the chippers. The companies have mobile chippers. They could go out into the forests, chip there and transport the timber in bins, which can be seen around this building also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those workers, who have those expensive rigs and who are tied to large overdrafts, are forced by the system to go out and take just the maximum weight of timber to the chippers. Logs two feet in diameter and branches are being left on the forest floor and burnt simply because it is not economical for those workers, because of the economic situation that the chipping companies have put them in, to pick up those important pieces of timber and take them in to be chipped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not true that this industry is efficient economically or efficient in terms of the timber that it has used. As I say, I express</PARA>
<PARA>great sympathy for those workers who are really being caught as the meat in the sandwich. I believe it is wrong for them to blame the conservation movement. If we had taken notice of the conservation movement from the 1960s onwards, we would be at least 20 to 30 years down the track towards having more extensive plantation forestry, and there would be adequate timber both for the imports which Senator Sandy Macdonald referred to and also for the supply of timber and chips to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>I move this motion reluctantly, because this is an issue. I am not a subscriber to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> magazine, but my attention was drawn to this so-called sex guide by a columnist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> called Lawrie Kavanagh, who is regarded very affectionately by people in Queensland as a voice of the people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anything Australia has been at the forefront of the looney left, politically correct takeover of society, a takeover sanctioned, indeed encouraged, by our politicians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those excesses slip by because the majority either don't know or don't care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That must have been the case with Carmen Lawrence's endorsement of a national women's magazine "safe sex guide" in its December issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carmen has been touted as a chance to become our first female PM and is Minister for Human Services and Health at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As her department and our taxes collaborated with the magazine to produce the "safe sex guide", it seems only natural that the Minister should endorse it with enthusiasm, but the question is did she do a Ros Kelly?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If she did read this "guide" then she has recommended the delightful and health-giving joys of anal intercourse, or sodomy as it was called in less enlightened times, for heterosexual couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So does "Julie, 23," one of the case histories in the "guide", endorse sodomy with enthusiasm&mdash;". . .  each time, the sense of forbidden fruit has made it so exciting . . . the vibe is more primeval, more erotic . . . like losing your virginity all over again".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But remember, as the Health Minister of this nation says, it deals with the issues in a non-judgemental way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And after all it does not fail to stress the need to take precautions and use condoms, certainly when "Anal stimulation can be enjoyed in various forms through rimming (licking and sucking on the area around the anus)" which the "guide" reports can be a "real turn on".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope you appreciate these extracts from the "safe sex guide" because it is a resource that everyone should read and a lot of concerned people worked long and hard with your money to produce it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But while nothing the looney left minority writes, says or does would surprise the majority, the Health Minister's endorsement of anal intercourse and its associated health-giving foreplays is a bit of a worry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yet here we have a national Health Minister endorsing a tax-funded "sex guide" which recommends the very act that can lead to death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless, of course, the Minister did a Ros Kelly and didn't read the material before endorsing it. In which case she is still a bit of a worry.</PARA>

I speak as a medical practitioner with over 30 years experience. The reality of life is that that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> guide advocates this as a normal sexual practice. It puts it out in glamorous fashion as something to be enjoyed and an activity that normal people should encourage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sending a copy of this guide&mdash;at least the extract that I referred to&mdash;to every member of parliament, on both the government side as well as the opposition side, because it is an issue that affects all of us in this society. It is not something that should be fobbed off as being just something about which a crazy fellow on the other side is trying to score off the government. I am not. It is something fundamental in this society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to enable the recently enacted safe third country provisions of the Migration Act 1958 to cover Vietnamese refugees who had already been successfully resettled in the People's Republic of China but who lodged claims for a protection visa in Australia after 30 December 1994. More generally the bill is also to enable the safe third country provisions of the Act to have effect from a specified date preceding the date of commencement of any future agreements and relevant regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last session of Parliament the Government introduced safe third country amendments to the Migration Act to ensure that certain non-citizens in relation to whom there is a safe third country, or who are covered by the Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-Chinese Refugees (CPA), should not be allowed to apply for a protection  visa. The purpose of the legislation was to prevent forum shopping by people who had already found a country which offered them protection, or whose claims for refugee status had been rejected under an appropriate determination system.  The first application of the legislation was in respect of people who arrived in Australia from Galang in Indonesia where they had been assessed as not being refugees under a refugee determination process approved by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation has been effective in ensuring that the relatively small numbers of asylum seekers from Galang arriving here after the legislation was passed were returned and others in similar circumstances were discouraged from attempting to circumvent the Comprehensive Plan of Action brokered by UNHCR. What the current legislation did not foresee was a situation where large numbers of people arrive very quickly from a place where they have received effective and on-going protection, but with which Australia does not have an existing safe third country agreement. Under the legislation as it stands, Australia has no choice but to process to finality all claims from these people lodged before a safe third country agreement has been reached. In other words, it is possible for people to arrive in Australia from what is in fact a safe third country, and access our refugee determination system because an agreement between that country and Australia has not been negotiated. This is not in the interests of the safe third country, the country to which the asylum seekers travel or UNHCR. It encourages rapid and destabilising irregular movements of people and undermines the concerted actions of governments and the UNHCR to provide durable solutions in countries of first asylum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From October 1994, 695 people, largely ethnic Chinese Vietnamese from Southern China, have arrived by boat in Australia. Neither Australia nor China considers it desirable to encourage this flow of people. More importantly, information from UNHCR, the Government of China and our own representatives in southern China has shown conclusively that these people have received the protection of China since they began arriving there from Vietnam in the late 1970s. The details outlined in the statement on the prescribing of the PRC as a safe third country, which will be tabled in Parliament shortly, reveal the group in question to have been treated humanely and that every effort has been made to help them integrate socially and economically into Chinese society. To encourage the belief that simply by sailing to Australia they, and the many like them who remain in China, can undermine the resettlement efforts made on their behalf by China and the UNHCR is wrong. The Government does not believe that this in the best interests of the ethnic Chinese Vietnamese community in China and it is not in the best interests of the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia makes a considerable effort internationally, through our overseas aid program, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives and our  assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to support efforts to help refugees return to their own country or to resettle in their country of first asylum. Where resettlement in Australia is the most appropriate approach, cases are considered in an orderly way under our Humanitarian Program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life. The irregular and illegal movement to Australia of people who have no grounds for claiming to be refugees from China undermines these and similar efforts made by the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 December 1994, it was announced that the Government would introduce into this session of Parliament legislation designed to ensure that, from that date, certain unauthorised arrivals from the PRC would not be allowed to gain access to Australia's refugee determination system. The announcement underlines the fact that a country may have, in fact, been a safe third country well before it has been prescribed as one by Australia. To alleviate the paradoxical situation of a country appearing to be an unsafe country one day and a safe country the next, and to avoid the possibility of a similar situation to that which we have recently found ourselves in respect of China, Australia would have to negotiate safe third country agreements with every country in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sensible alternative, clearly signalled on 30 December 1994 in the case of the boat arrivals from China, is to amend the legislation to enable Australian law to reflect the pre-existing reality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill being introduced today will allow the sensible operation of the safe third country legislation by ensuring that all people who have protection in a safe third country will be treated in the same way, rather than the anomalous situation that exists under present law where people from the STC who apply before a safe third country agreement is concluded are allowed to engage our protection obligations whereas those who arrive in precisely the same circumstances but after an agreement has been reached cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation `will not, and cannot result in people being returned to a country that is not a safe third country. No-one will be returned unless they are covered by a safe third country agreement or there has been proper examination of their claim for protection. The legislation also does not apply to anyone who has been granted a substantive visa or to whom it has been determined Australia owes protection obligations before the safe third country regulation takes effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be noted that the Minister retains a non-compellable discretion to allow a person's application to remain valid despite this legislation if the Minister judges that to be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks to make Australia's contribution to international efforts to reduce the large-scale illegal movement of people effective and consistent. Its main effect will be to eliminate inconsistencies in the way people are dealt with under the safe third country provisions of the Migration Act who are in all respects the same, other than in the date they arrived in Australia. It contains a very effective safety net to ensure that people affected by it are either returned to a prescribed safe third country or allowed into our refugee determination system.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has two purposes, both of which relate to the need to protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's first purpose is to ensure that the fertility control policies of the government of a foreign country are disregarded in determining if a non-citizen is a member of a particular social group within the meaning of the Refugee Convention as amended by the Refugee Protocol for the purposes of considering an application for a protection visa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was among the first to sign the Refugees Convention, and the Migration Act and our refugee determination system reflect the seriousness with which we take our obligations under the Convention. The Convention states that a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. A commonly used example of the kind of social group the Convention had in mind is that of the Kulaks of the then USSR who were persecuted because they were a land owning class which the Government of the day wished to eradicate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Useful though the ground of social group undoubtedly is, it is also the most difficult to define in practice. Assessment of whether a claimant is a member of a particular social group is usually left to those who administer and review our refugee determination system. However, the implication of the recent Federal Court judgement that a person may be recognised as a member of a particular social group simply because he or she is a person to whom the fertility control policy of a foreign government applies, or who objects to such a policy, has such potentially serious consequences that the Government has decided to introduce the current bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the recent judgement distorts the meaning of the Convention ground of particular social group to such a degree that the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system would be threatened if it were allowed to stand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To regard a large proportion of the population of China, or any country, as a social group and therefore as potential refugees simply on the basis of their government's fertility control policy is inconsistent with the intention of the Convention to provide protection to refugees with a well founded fear of persecution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing this legislation I emphasise that the Government is not questioning that the Convention ground of particular social group is a useful and necessary concept. Indeed the Government is seeking to bring the application of this concept into line with our international obligations following the recent Federal Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also wish to make it clear that this bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a particular pre-existing social group, or on any of the other Convention grounds, who has a well founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person from a particular village or workplace who is subjected to the rogue application of a fertility control policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under the legislation introduced today. Nor will a person who is a member of a particular religious, political or racial group subject to the persecutory application of fertility control policies be denied consideration of their claims under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned to address issues which might arise from gender based persecution and has been working actively in this area for some time. For instance our Humanitarian Program contains a specific women at risk component which targets resettlement assistance to refugee women in particularly vulnerable situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government is concerned to ensure that the Convention is interpreted correctly. This will ensure the retention of public commitment to our refugee determination system and the integrity and effectiveness of that system. Incorrectly diluting the meaning of particular social group under the Convention has the potential to undermine that public confidence and the ability of our determination system to do the job it was set up to do&mdash;to afford protection to genuine refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation introduced today will help provide a common sense approach to the definition of a particular social group under the Convention by precluding the possibility of very large numbers of people with nothing in common but that they may be affected in some way by the fertility control policies of their government being caught within the definition of a social group under the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second purpose of the bill introduced today is to prevent a non citizen from making further applications for a protection visa when they have already made an application, whether or not the prior application has been finally determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia operates one of the most thorough, efficient and equitable refugee determination systems in the world. A person's claim is assessed against the Convention definition of a refugee, and if it is not accepted at the primary stage, the person may appeal to the independent Refugee Review Tribunal which may reverse the primary decision. If a person's claim is still not accepted at the RRT stage, it is open to that person to seek review on administrative law grounds from the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current legislation, when a person has exhausted this process, it is not difficult for them to lodge another application for a protection visa and start the whole process again. The fact that repeat applications serve to delay the removal from Australia of the applicant has led to their increased use. The processing of these repeat applications, which like the initial application are free of charge to the applicant, is both expensive and time consuming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a system is fair, open and contains the right to appeal the primary decision, claimants will generally have no need to repeat the whole process to get a fair hearing. That fair hearing is amply provided by the system as it exists already. The bill introduced today therefore will have the effect of barring repeat applications in the majority of cases. Its intention in doing so is to protect the integrity of, and support for Australia's refugee determination system and to ensure that available resources are expended on claims for protection which have not yet been exhaustively assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing this bar on repeat applications, the Government is aware that there will remain circumstances in which particular repeat applications may merit consideration. These cases are likely to include repeat applications which contain information which was not available to the claimant during the course of the first application, and which is of a nature that is likely to have a real bearing on the assessment of the need for protection. Events in the country of origin of the claimant that have occurred since the first claim may also mean that a second consideration is warranted. The Government has therefore decided that the Minister will retain a discretion to allow particular repeat applications to be assessed by the full refugee determination process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Minister's non-compellable discretion may only be exercised by the Minister personally, measures will be taken to ensure that all cases in which the Minister might wish to exercise his or her discretion are identified and brought to the Minister's attention. In such cases the Minister will present to Parliament the reasons for the exercise of his or her discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both aspects of the bill introduced today demonstrate the Government's resolve to maintain a refugee determination system that is targeted towards those with a claim to Australia's protection under our Refugee Convention obligations. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that there are some twenty million refugees in the world today. Australia has an obligation to help these people through the most effective means at our disposal. We  meet this obligation through our overseas aid program, our assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives, our Humanitarian Program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life, and through our on-shore refugee determination system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the need arises to defend these efforts and to maintain their credibility, public support and effectiveness, as in the present case, the Government will do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day in the winter sittings 1995, in accordance with the order agreed to 29 November 1994. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to comment on this very important, albeit very brief, report of the Auditor-General. There has been very widespread concern in the community about the capacity of this government to use taxpayer funds for partisan political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report indicates that the Auditor-General sought to carry out an efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service. The 1 1/2 pages of the report indicate that the government and the service blocked the efficiency audit. In other words, the Auditor-General was not allowed to assess the efficiency of the work that is carried out by the National Media Liaison Service&mdash;more commonly referred to as aNiMaLS. This is a very serious matter which has come before the chamber and which has been brought to our attention by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role and functions of the National Media Liaison Service were set out some years ago by Senator Bolkus. The first role was to provide accurate and timely information on government policies and programs to the media throughout Australia, as well as information on policies to interest groups within electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second role was that representatives in each of the state capitals, Darwin and Townsville should cooperate with ministerial staff to coordinate media arrangements but not have any direct responsibility for arranging itineraries. The third role was that state representatives are to provide local members of all parties with details of government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth role specified was that representatives will not work with local or state party branches and will not be involved in party programs, nor electoral campaigning. The fifth role was to coordinate the distribution of detailed information on government policies&mdash;and I stress that it is government policies&mdash;and programs from the information units of various departments to local media. The final role was to monitor local media to provide media summaries. Monitoring, however, was stated as being secondary in importance to media to achieve information dissemination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that, whatever the role specified there, the NMLS in fact carries out work that is very substantially different. It costs the taxpayer $1.5 million. The essential work of the National Media Liaison Service is not, I believe, to inform the public about the activities of the Labor government but to monitor and analyse the work of the opposition. It is no wonder that the Auditor-General was very savage in his report about the blocking of an efficiency audit. The last thing the government wanted was for the Auditor-General to look at the books and to look at the work that has been carried out in this unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give notice that I shall be calling before a Senate estimates committee on Friday the director of the National Media Liaison Service, Mr Epstein, so that he can explain to the Senate just what work he has been carrying out. We intend to pursue this with vigour. The government has set out the role of the National Media Liaison Service, but we know from what the press says and we know from the activities of NMLS that it is carrying out a very different role indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday 17 January 1995, after this report was tabled, ran an editorial headed: `Time to axe partisan media unit'. I wonder if Mr Epstein, in his monitoring of the media, circulated that to the press gallery. I wonder if he circulated it to ministers of the government. Among other things, the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Keating Government was serious about saving public money and enhancing the integrity of the political process at the same time it would move immediately to scrap the National Media Liaison Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abolition of the service&mdash;which is little more than a taxpayer-funded propaganda unit&mdash;would remove a blot that has perverted the nation's political system for too long.</PARA>

<PARA>I put it to the Senate that there is continuing a serious misuse of public funding. We all remember the infamous sports rorts affair. We remember a number of multicultural grants being made before the 1990 election which were never announced to the wider community. We know the ability of this government to use funds it compulsorily raises from taxpayers for party political purposes. If the government wants to have a taxpayer funded unit, a taxpayer funded hit-squad, to attack the opposition, then let it come out and say that that is what it is doing and let us have a debate on that issue. But the government should not pretend that it is a government information unit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Media Liaison Service is not the only media arm of the government. It has also the Ministerial Media Group, which has some 12 to 15 employees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the government itself has been embarrassed and has hidden behind the Audit Act as it stood to prevent the efficiency audit by the Auditor-General. But in the coming weeks a new audit act will be brought before this parliament. The former Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, says that he understands that this act will not provide explicitly for the performance audit mandate of the Auditor-General to extend to activities such as those of the National Media Liaison Service, but he goes on to say&mdash;I suspect he must have been told by the government itself:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand, however, that it is intended that this will be addressed by regulation only and therefore not be a central tenet in the provisions of the legislation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, as the government has hinted, the new regulations will in the future allow an efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service, I am prepared to place a bet that the activities of that unit will be changed very rapidly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will have to come up-front.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Auditor-General's report on the National Media Liaison Service. I point out in opening that in the budget last year, in which the government sought to further squeeze the Auditor-General, it was the Democrats who were able to press for a wider and more comprehensive brief for the Auditor-General and also to extract from the government an undertaking that the Auditor-General's financial situation would be improved so that he could more adequately carry out his very important task. The Auditor-General is one of those individuals, one of those institutions, who actually stand between the executive government and corruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that as a background, I believe the parliament must take very careful note of this report from the Auditor-General. Here we have a report from a very important servant of the parliament. He is not a servant of the executive government. He is a servant of the parliament, therefore a servant of openness, and indirectly a servant of the Australian people in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General, in his report, is informing the parliament that he is unable to undertake his duties because of barriers which, in this case, have been put up by executive government. The proposed efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service was to be part of a broader efficiency audit of government information and advertising. This audit was to address the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the government's massive information and advertising activities, and we share many of the concerns that Senator Kemp has just mentioned in relation to the activities of this body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NMLS, or aNiMaLS as it is known in popular jargon, plays a vital role in the government's information machine. Many have long suspected that aNiMaLS is a purely political beast designed to publicise the case for re-electing the Labor government and to collect any dirt it can on the opposition through its extensive media monitoring. In using the term `opposition', we would include ourselves because we believe that the government would also be wanting to collect dirt on the Democrats, Independents and minor parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANiMaLS has constantly denied this allegation, arguing that its job is to publicise government activity rather than the government per se. An efficiency audit would have been a very effective way of proving the case one way or the other, but there is the hole to which the Auditor-General refers. ANiMaLS, while paid out of government money, is not technically part of any government department. Therefore, the Auditor-General cannot conduct an efficiency audit of the service without the approval of the minister&mdash;in this case the Minister for Administrative Services, Frank Walker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's response delivered to the Australian National Audit Office in November was that the proposed review was ultra vires. He has refused to allow the auditor of public money to attest whether public money is being used efficiently and effectively. This is frankly scandalous. It highlights the urgent need to pass and to strengthen the Auditor-General bill coming before this place next week. It highlights the need for the mandate of the Auditor-General to be able to access any government body whatsoever in any of the bizarre forms that this government has created and to examine what has been done with the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to foreshadow that the Democrats will be seeking to amend the Auditor-General bill next week to confirm the widest possible mandate for the Auditor-General. This is in line with the steps that we took last year to widen the Auditor-General's brief and also to guarantee that he had more adequate facilities to carry out his task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should not be let off the hook. The government or the Department of Finance has already agreed that organisations like aNiMaLS should be subject to efficiency audits and is drafting a regulation under the new bill to achieve this. Ignoring the question of where it should be, in regulation or in the bill proper, the fact is that after the bill comes into effect, most likely on 1 July, an efficiency audit will be possible. So the question still stands: why is the minister now denying the Auditor-General access to NMLS? What has aNiMaLS got to hide between now and 1 July?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suggestions that were hinted at earlier, that there will be a massive shredding of documents before that occurs, may well indicate what the minister does have to hide. I call on the Minister for Administrative Services or his senior minister, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), to immediately authorise an efficiency audit of aNiMaLS and/or any other information or advertising agency of government not within his department but within his portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the two former speakers, I join in calling upon the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) to conduct an immediate inquiry into the National Media Liaison Service, commonly known as aNiMaLS.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NMLS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the body in question&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is therefore not subject to the normal accountability mechanisms in place over Government programs. As a consequence, although NMLS is fully funded by the taxpayer and its stated roles and functions are predominantly administrative in nature, its operations are not subject to the scrutiny normally associated with the expenditure of public monies.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have here is a grave breach of accountability of government expenditure and the operation of bodies that act at the government's direction. We also have another grave issue and that is the fact that the government is using taxpayers' money to conduct operations which are of an electoral nature. In fact, an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> dated 17 January this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By sending to media groups transcripts of statements by Opposition MPs highlighting any blunders, policy or personal conflicts or other material damaging to the coalition, it has played a blatantly partisan role.</PARA>
<PARA>That was stated in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> earlier this month. So even sections of the press can recognise what a partisan political role this body plays at the expense of the taxpayer. In fact, on 17 January this year there was a report on this body in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> which followed a previous report in that paper which had stated that aNiMaLS had assembled old video clips and a dossier damaging to John Howard in anticipation of his replacing Alexander Downer as Liberal leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been complaints before by previous Liberal leaders as to the partisan role that this body plays. The press has picked this up and has recognised that this indeed is a most serious situation. The government is pushing a propaganda line, a line which is anti-opposition or anti any opposition to it, using taxpayers' money in the process. This body scrutinises anyone who dares voice opposition to the government and sets to work exposing any conflicts or problems that opposition might have and then sends it off to the media. That is really what this body is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is outrageous that there cannot be any scrutiny by the Auditor-General of this body and its practices. It is not surprising that when the Auditor-General set out to scrutinise this body he was stopped.

I join with previous speakers in demanding that in the interests of democracy and in the interests of accountable government there be an immediate inquiry into this matter.

Undoubtedly, it was because it was concerned as to what would be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office then, quite properly, wrote to the minister seeking his assistance in resolving the impasse. But what happened? The minister replied on 5 December saying that the `review you propose is ultra vires the Audit Act,' and referred to a legal opinion&mdash;undoubtedly, once again obtained at taxpayers' expense to create a legal technicality behind which the government could hide and avoid an audit of the National Media Liaison Service. Of course, technically it was ultra vires. However, the new Audit Act will overcome that problem and, once it has come into force, hopefully we will get to see what this outrageous organisation has been engaging in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can ask why the minister has simply delayed the inevitable. Undoubtedly, the National Media Liaison Service will get the shredders working overtime to ensure that nothing is left behind which could indicate the type of work it was doing.

But I, as the responsible minister, am more than happy to have this part of my administration audited by you to confirm that it is a genuine body, to confirm to the people of Australia that the likes of Senator Kemp have been pedalling untruths about the National Media Liaison Service.'

Clearly, government senators are very concerned about this, and the commencement of interjections from the other side clearly indicates they are very nervous. So they ought be. Whilst they might have been able to stymie the Auditor-General, I would not think them able to stymie the Senate estimates committee process. The Senate estimates committee has the power to call before it certain individuals and, in fact, ask them how they spend the day and who tells them what to do&mdash;who told them to develop this video of John Howard clips from the past; who gave them that direction; and how is that of assistance to the people of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that it may be of some assistance in the Labor Party's desperate attempt to hold on to office. But we know that, with the leadership change and the way the Liberal Party is performing now, we will see a change in government. No matter what attempts the Labor Party makes through this sleazy National Media Liaison Service, which it will not subject to audit, we will still win, we will still beat it. The reason for that is that the people of Australia are starting to see through the way this government acts. As former Senator Richardson said, the Labor Party will do whatever it takes; no matter how immoral, no matter how amoral, it will do whatever it takes. When it comes to a question of public accountability of $1.5 million, it will hide behind a legal technicality to protect its propaganda machine. But the people of Australia are now aware of the sorts of campaigns being undertaken by the Labor Party, and that is why they will reject it at the next poll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Auditor-General's report is, quite frankly, a very sad reflection on the way this government operates. Whilst there is a legal technicality, which I trust will be overcome by the new Audit Act, I would have thought the government could have shown good faith by saying to the Auditor-General and the people of Australia, `Look, there is a legal technicality, but we don't mind that legal technicality; we will not rely on it. We invite you to audit the National Media Liaison Service and see what it really gets up to.' But the government did not want that, and the reason for that is very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a very sad reflection on this government's commitment to public accountability, its commitment to integrity. In fact, the government's reaction&mdash;as demonstrated by the Labor Party interjections during this debate&mdash;clearly confirms the very worst fears of many Australians; that is, that the National Media Liaison Service is not a dinky-di organisation but simply a front for the Australian Labor Party to pedal its propaganda. </PARA>

We have to recognise that it is not just a loophole in the law that has enabled this spying, cheating organisation financed by the taxpayer but directed by this government to escape the scrutiny that all bodies spending taxpayers' money should be subjected to. Everyone accepts that proposition, which is stated in the amending Audit Bill which has not yet passed this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of principle that the government accepts should be enshrined in law and yet, because there is a loophole in law at the present time, this organisation, which is a disgrace and which has demonstrated itself to be a propaganda arm of the Labor Party, not of the government, is spending an inordinate amount of its time eavesdropping on opposition statements and operating in a political way. For example, as we have heard it has drummed up a video of Mr Howard's past statements. This organisation is being protected from proper scrutiny, as I said not by a loophole in the law but by a decision of a minister of this government, Frank Walker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Frank Walker has the power to allow the Auditor-General, as it does with every other body, to conduct a proper investigation of the National Media Liaison Service. He has refused that permission. He has decided to block the Auditor-General from investigating the expenditure of $1 1/2 million by a dishonest, crooked organisation that was appointed by a dishonest, crooked government for dishonest, crooked purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would the minister make that personal ministerial decision? Is it because the minister does not support the principle that this government is now pursuing that all expenditure should be subject to audit? Does this minister have something to hide, or does it fit into the pattern of deception by this minister in his dealings with this parliament of which so many of us are well aware. I am certainly aware of this because of his disgraceful responses to my requests to have my electorate office in Wollongong moved after the lease expired to an area near my principal place of residence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister will do or say anything in pursuit of political power.

There was Senator Bolkus, and the less said about him in this context the better. We have a tradition of ministers, obviously appointed by a government, whose main objective is to misuse taxpayers' money through this organisation in a disgraceful way. The government has picked people to run or to have administrative control over the organisation who, in general, it feels will operate in a blatant and dishonest political way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this debate is all about today. This government has chosen to misuse taxpayers' money in this way. It has chosen to misuse the minister's discretion in this way so that the minister can block a proper inquiry of the expenditure of this money. There is a deliberate pattern of deception and deceit, but we expect that from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise that an efficiency audit is not just an audit to determine whether this organisation is being efficient. It is an examination of whether it is properly spending taxpayers' money and whether the pattern of its expenditures relates to its objectives and its directions on how it should be spending its money and what it should be doing. We have already heard about the role of the National Media Liaison Service. There is hardly any evidence that justifies this organisation spending its time spying on the opposition or creating videos of past speeches of the new opposition leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, an efficiency audit would determine whether this body is spending money in the manner which is appropriate to its creation. The fact clearly emerges, as a result of the refusal by this minister to allow this inquiry, that money is being improperly spent. Part of the $1 1/2 million&mdash;we do not know how much&mdash;being spent by the National Media Liaison Service is being improperly spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises another interesting question. It was the Attorney-General's Department that told the minister that, in its opinion, the Audit Act did not in fact cover efficiency audits of this body. It seems unfortunate that all the Audit Office had to rely on was advice from the Attorney-General's Department. There was a clear conflict of interest within the Attorney-General's Department. I do not know what sort of glass walls they have there. If the Auditor-General had the right to seek independent legal advice, I wonder whether it would have been the same as the advice that the Attorney-General's office gave to the minister. After all, I suppose you can say that it is the minister and the ministry that employ the Attorney-General, not the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the advice did have any partisan elements, to what extent would the best interests of the client, the Auditor-General, be served by the Attorney-General's Department, bearing in mind its relationship with the minister, rather than with the Auditor-General?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I am not sure whether to thank you for your very strict enforcement of standing orders or thank the minister for his indulgence; I will have to get that clarified later on. I wish to speak briefly about an ILO convention which has been tabled, not in the Senate today but since the last day of sitting. This is the ILO convention No. 174 and recommendation No. 181 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Prevention of major industrial accidents</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will be aware, I have been very concerned about the lack of involvement of the parliament of this nation in the consideration of the treaty-making activities of this government. There have been many cases where multilateral conventions, UN treaties and conventions, have been signed, as well as ILO conventions which have been done, without any proper consideration by the parliament or without any public debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often some years down the track we find that under international law Australia is bound to act in a certain manner. Of course, the most dramatic example of that was really the discovery by many Australians that, for the first time since 1986, Australian domestic disputes could be adjudicated offshore by UN human rights committees. I have expressed my concern a number of times in this parliament that such an important decision was taken by the executive without any significant public debate or any wider consideration of the long-term ramifications of such an action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, in relation to the ILO, this is a tripartite body&mdash;a body which I think over a long period of time has generally enjoyed the support of unions, industry and governments. Regrettably, I think, because of the actions of the Keating government and the industrial relations ministers and the secret treaty making of the government, that tripartite and bipartisan approach to the ILO has come under very severe pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just before the last election, the Keating government ratified ILO convention No. 158, concerning the retrenchment of employees, without making a press release. We discovered after the election that Mr Keating and his colleagues had ratified this convention hours before the writs were issued. This convention, along with a number of others, provided a head of power for the so-called Industrial Relations Reform Act, which in itself has now been challenged before the ILO. But the point of me drawing this to the attention of the Senate today is that I have not had time to closely examine the convention, which has been put before us today, and whether there are ramifications of this which would require more careful consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that it has gone to state officials and that the ACTU is supportive of the convention but, interestingly, Mr Brereton tells us that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is supportive of the development of a national standard `described below'. It is not clear from what Mr Brereton tells us in this document whether the ACCI is supportive of the ratification of the convention. If it is not, it would have been handy for Mr Brereton to actually inform the Senate why it is not supportive. I put that question. It is one to which I would be interested to receive an answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued to read in the background statement tabled by Mr Brereton that `in accordance with article 19 of the ILO constitution the Australian government is required to submit the text of new conventions and recommendations to the competent authority&mdash;that is, the Australian parliament&mdash;following their adoption by the International Labour Conference'. I would be intrigued to know whether that practice was followed with ILO Convention No. 158? If that practice was not followed, what flowed from that? I will be seeking further advice on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that this parliament consider very carefully international treaties and conventions which the executive government goes off and signs. A number of UN multilateral conventions have had quite profound effects upon the legal system of this country. Although I welcome the fact that the text has been signed and that the minister has given us a covering statement, I think the ratification of this convention raises important questions for this parliament, such as: what is the position of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well and truly understand having international treaties and international conventions between two nations for defence reasons, trade reasons or a whole variety of reasons.

The fact is that this government has consistently misused international conventions to override the rights of the states and this place in a manner which is not in the best interests of Australia. It suits the lawyers of the country. It keeps the High Court of this country occupied. Until we get a process where these conventions are properly examined and dealt with in the best interests of Australia, we will continue to see legislation being passed on the basis of conventions being challenged in the High Court.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction to Chapter 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth/State agreements define the functions of the State Co-ordination Units, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">'Consistent with national strategies, develop and promote programs for education, information and public awareness and disseminate information.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories therefore have primary responsibility for recruitment, education and information as they are intricately linked to the provision of services. Expertise and knowledge at the local level is considered important in fulfilling these functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States are also required to ensure that each service has a recruitment plan which is consistent with the National Accreditation Requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allocation of funds for recruitment at the State level is directly linked to the number of women screened. The Commonwealth/State agreement for the second phase of the Program includes a component, 17% of the amount per woman screened, for recruitment, information and education at the State and Service level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on the number of women which the Program estimates will be screened during 1994-95, up to $12 million will be available for recruitment and the provision of information for women and general practitioners. In addition a further $2.4 million has been allocated to national activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adequate funding has been allocated for national communication activities over the 5 years commencing 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That representations be made to the Victorian Electoral Commissioner to obtain access to the Victorian Electoral Roll for the purposes of the screening Program in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian Electoral Commissioner has now granted BreastScreen access to the Victorian Electoral Roll.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a broader issue of access to the Commonwealth Electoral roll.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present some access is possible with the gazettal of Regulations to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and Guidelines for the Conduct of Public Health Screening Programs in December 1993. However, the information cannot be provided by gender without an alteration to the Commonwealth Electoral Act itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Human Services and Health has recently written to the Minister for Administrative Services requesting that the Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner be approached to consider amending the legislation as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Commonwealth Government, in co-operation with the States and Territories, undertake a national education campaign promoting the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer and that the educational campaign:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">emphasise the importance for women of the early detection of breast cancer and the services currently available;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">clarify the limitations of the screening program, emphasising that mammographic screening is an aid to the diagnosis of breast cancer but will not prevent the disease;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">provide information to women and the community generally as the why the Program specifically targets women aged 50-69 years;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">provide information to women, the medical profession and the community generally on the difference between diagnostic and screening mammography;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">disseminate culturally relevant information about the Program to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women; and ensure that this information is widely disseminated through Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, especially through the network of Aboriginal Health Services; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">disseminate information to women on non-English speaking backgrounds and women in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first four points of this recommendation have been addressed in the National Program's National Communication Strategy, copy at Attachment 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The identified target audiences are women aged 25 years and over&mdash;with women over 50 years the main target group and women aged 40-49 years and 25-39 a secondary target&mdash;and health professionals with an emphasis on general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The communication objectives are consistent with this recommendation. They are to increase awareness that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">breast cancer is a major health issue for women;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the risk of breast cancer increases with age, particularly from age 50;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">mammography screening does not prevent breast cancer but is the most effective method of detecting the cancer at an early stage when treatment is most effective;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">mammography screening has been shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer among women aged 50 years and over;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there is insufficient evidence of benefit in population mammography screening for women aged under 50 years;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there is a National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the general practitioner has a major role in a screening program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program is currently in the process of appointing an advertising agency to undertake a major information campaign, which is to be launched mid February 1995 with television and print advertising aimed at women and the general community. This will be supported by various public relations activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent research with general practitioners has shown that they have a poor understanding of the difference between screening and diagnostic mammography; have concerns about the effectiveness/accuracy of the procedure and radiation risks; and need information about the appropriate screening age and interval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A separate strategy will be developed by a small reference group within the Program with general practitioner and program management representatives. The aim of the group will be to formulate a strategy which will provide information in a way which is acceptable to general practitioners, will motivate them to encourage women to be screened and will enhance their standing within the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the strategy will use general practitioners and other clinicians who support the Program. It may also be feasible to work through the professional Colleges and General Practice Divisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The communication objectives listed above also form the basis of the information provided at the State and service level. A local approach is often more appropriate, as information can be linked to the launch of a service in an area. It also enables the use of local networks and, if necessary, the provision of material which is culturally acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience in the Program has also found that if general practitioners are approached with information on an individual basis when a service goes into an area they are more likely to support the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of information for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women at a national level is considered inappropriate. The State and Territory Governments support this position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These materials need to be culturally relevant and acceptable to the community. This can only be achieved if the material is developed in close collaboration with the local community. The Aboriginal Health Service and Aboriginal women's services, where these exist, are often closely involved in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific information about the Program for women from non English speaking backgrounds is also available. BreastScreen Victoria has made available to the Program at no cost the translation of the Victorian pamphlets into 10 languages. The pamphlets have been developed in close association with the ethnic communities, including extensive focus testing of the translations. The languages are; Italian, Greek, Macedonian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Spanish, Arabic, Serbian, Croatian and Turkish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most States now have pamphlets available in other languages and have also translated the consent forms and information sheets. In addition, translators are available at the screening service if required. Ethnic radio and the ethnic press are used to disseminate information, as well as addresses to women's groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a national level, the Program has sponsored an episode of the SBS program `English at Work' on breast cancer. This was screened twice during 1993 in English and five other languages&mdash;Spanish, Greek, Arabic, Vietnamese and Italian. All States have copies of the program and it is used at the local level when specific groups are being targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist the States in disseminating this information to women from non English speaking backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, additional unmatched Commonwealth funding totalling $300,000 has been offered to the States/Territories in 1994-95 for special recruitment initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the State and Territory Co-ordination Units provide data collected relating to the screening Program to the National Breast Cancer Centre for further analysis and research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts the recommendation that data collected about the screening program be supplied to the National Breast Cancer Centre for purposes which fall within their terms of reference, but wishes to propose that it be provided by the National Co-ordination Unit rather than the State and Territory Co-ordination Units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government would ensure the utmost co-operation in collaborating with the National Breast Cancer Centre. The National Program would be able to provide, on a routine basis, aggregate data based on its regular data collection and respond to other requests as required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data collected within the National Program for the Early Detection is being collected for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating its performance. Consent forms which clients sign within the Program inform women of the purpose for which the data is collected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The collection and use of data within the Program has been an evolving process. Considerable effort has gone into negotiating the terms and conditions for the transfer and use of data. Only aggregate data is collected nationally as privacy and other legal constraints prevent the transfer of unit record data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tables containing non-identifiable, aggregate data are supplied on a regular basis from the State Co-ordination Units to the National Co-ordination Unit.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data is used to ascertain compliance to Commonwealth/State funding agreements; for quality control which is linked to the Accreditation process; and to feed back comparative data to the services within the Program. The feedback of information from the national and state levels to services is considered integral to quality control within the Program. Equally important is the national function to report to Parliament, to women and to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of reference for the National Breast Cancer Centre (see Attachment 2) do not include research. It is therefore considered inappropriate for the State Co-ordination Units to supply data to the Centre for the purpose outlined in the Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, it is possible that such a process would result in the duplication of administrative effort if data was to be supplied from State Co-ordination Units to both the National Co-ordination Unit and the Breast Cancer Centre. States would need to deal with an additional body with potentially different data requests, timeframes and personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chapter 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the supply of radiographers be regularly monitored by Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the supply of radiologists be regularly monitored by Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of this Report, recommendations 4 and 5 have been interpreted to relate to the supply of radiographers and radiologists in relation to breast cancer screening and treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports Recommendations 4 and 5, but notes that they are essentially State issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth/State agreement for the continuation of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer, which has recently been offered to all States, lists as a State responsibility the monitoring of work force supply within the State and encouragement of the availability of adequate numbers of appropriately skilled personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as the lack of availability of radiographers and radiologists is becoming an increasingly serious problem, efforts are also being made at the national level which go beyond monitoring the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was noted in the report that there is often conflicting evidence on the availability of radiographers in Australia. A survey of services within the Program is planned to quantify the extent and nature of the problem. Strategies will be developed in full consultation with the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officers of the Department of Human Services and Health and the Department of Immigration have met to discuss possibilities for dealing with the problem at a national level. Approaches will also be made to the Department of Employment, Education and Training if appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The supply of both radiographers and radiologists to the National Program is not simply a function of their numbers. Issues of location, conditions of work (especially on the mobile services) and the payment the Program is able to make will also need to be studied. This includes the possible impact of the monopoly effect on cost per woman screened </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">where the supply (especially of radiological services) is limited or withheld.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth inquiry into the supply of, and requirements for, medical specialist services in Australia reported to the Minister for Human Services and Health on 30 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry report was provided to the October meeting of AHMAC. The aim of this inquiry was to  identify factors influencing the availability, quality of, and access to specialist services. It was also intended that the inquiry examine current approaches to specialist training including: the number of training places; selection procedures for trainees; training methods and assessment; and length and location of training. While the focus of the inquiry was on the surgical specialties, the recommendations arising from the inquiry are likely to be of relevance to medical specialties generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Medical Workforce Data Review Committee (MWDRC), which is a subcommittee of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC), and is comprised of representatives from Commonwealth and State Health Authorities, the Australian Medical Council and peak organisations representing various components of the medical workforce, is responsible for monitoring specialist workforce and training post numbers, including those for individual specialties such as radiology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the MWDRC identify a shortage of radiologists, it can make recommendations to AHMAC on how to address such a shortage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 6</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That breast cancer support and counselling services be encouraged and expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation but notes that the funding of such groups is primarily by community fundraising not from government sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community based cancer support groups provide a significant function within the cancer field, and it is appropriate that they are operated by community members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the National Program there is considerable importance given to the counselling function. It is a requirement of accreditation that it be available for all women at the assessment stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the Services have direct links to community based cancer support groups, and these are encouraged at the State and local level by Services within the National Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the National Breast Cancer Centre will enhance the operation of the cancer support groups through its function to provide information to doctors and to women and the role it could serve to let women know of the availability of the cancer groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government support of events such as the National Breast Cancer Day assists in the support of the community for such groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction to Chapter 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of access for women to the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer is critical to the success of the Program and considerable effort has been made to ensure that the Services are as widely available as possible, and that the information is appropriate. In June 1994 a national telephone number (13 20 50) was established and is being widely publicised. Women anywhere in Australia can be connected to their nearest service for the price of a local call.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the program is a population based screening program which aims to have an impact on mortality rates from breast cancer, it aims to reach the maximum number of women possible in the target age group. This has meant as rapid an implementation as possible consistent with good planning and the maintenance of quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The infrastructure to reach such large numbers has been established first in those areas where there is a sufficient population base to enable efficient operation and in which recruitment activities will most likely be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recruitment of women in the harder to reach groups and regions has required the development of specific materials and strategies, and has drawn upon the more general experience. Resources for such recruitment are more readily available in the later stages of the five year implementation period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Strategies be implemented to improve access to the Program in rural and remote areas and that these strategies involve, where appropriate, the provision of financial assistance to encourage women to participate in the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program recognises that women in rural and remote areas may have some difficulty in accessing screening services and has set up a number of mobile services to extend the Program into these areas. As at 30 September 1994, there were 17 mobile services operating from fully equipped vans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some States, where mobile vans are not available special buses are provided to transport women to the fixed screening sites. In some States, limited financial assistance is available for the small number of women who may need to travel longer distances to attend for further assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several States are also using relocatables to reach rural and remote women. This service involves transporting and setting up a mammography machine at an appropriate venue, such as a community health centre. Women in the surrounding area are invited to attend during a specific period. The machine is then moved to the next town. This is a more cost effective way of providing a mobile service and it is expected that more will be put into operation. Strict quality control measures are undertaken to ensure the service remains of high quality by recalibrating the machine after each move and ensuring that all safety standards are met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Breast Cancer Screening National Costing Study considered the costs of providing screening services to rural women and concluded that the additional real cost of a rural/remote area service is between $20&mdash;$30 per woman screened. As a result, additional funding of nearly $2 million has been offered in 1994-95 for the screening of women who reside in rural and remote areas. The States will assess the various ways these funds can be used to assist women in rural and remote area to access the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Advisory Committee will be asked at its next meeting to consider establishing a subcommittee to look at implementation issues in rural and remote areas and to assess and develop strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access by women from rural and remote areas to screening services will be closely monitored by the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter of financial assistance is a State responsibility. It is noted, however, that such assistance needs to be equitably distributed across all needs and all sectors of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That strategies, sensitive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural values, be implemented to increase the access of these women to the Program, and the these strategies involve:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">close liaison with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-based health organisations, especially the Aboriginal Health Services; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the dissemination of culturally appropriate information about the Program throughout the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of strategies to increase the access for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women to the Program at a national level is considered inappropriate. The State and Territory Governments support this position. Strategies to ensure these women have access need to be culturally relevant and acceptable to the community. This can best be achieved with strategies that focus on the local community. The Aboriginal Health Service and Aboriginal women's services, where these exist, are closely involved in the development and implementation of these strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 9</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That strategies, sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and values of women on non-English speaking backgrounds be implemented to increase the access of women from these groups to the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each State and the ACT has implemented separate strategies in an effort to increase the number of women from non English speaking backgrounds participating in the National Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recently revised National Accreditation Requirements require the States to have a recruitment plan which details their specific plans to recruit women with non English speaking backgrounds and to ensure access to the Program for a significant number of this population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent research conducted on behalf of the Program indicates that women from non English speaking backgrounds are more likely to attend if they receive a referral from their general practitioner. A number of cultural requirements, such as minimal physical contact, minimal use of the word cancer and female radiographer were identified. These issues will be address in the recruitment strategies. The research also found that women in this group are less concerned about cancer and have a lower level of knowledge about cancer than women from English speaking backgrounds. They are more likely to attend if they can be screened via their community groups so women can support one another during the process. Women from this group often congregate in particular localities and a local, flexible campaign is more likely to achieve results. The research concluded that women from this group are just as likely to attend as the rest of the target group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, as with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, it is felt that local level recruitment strategies are most appropriate and effective. The Government notes that witnesses appearing before the Committee supported the use of local community networks in encouraging women to attend. The Commonwealth Government's role is to support these activities and undertake national advertising in the national ethnic press as planned during the advertising campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist the States in implementing their strategies and disseminating information to women from non English speaking backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, additional unmatched Commonwealth funding totalling $300,000 has been offered to the States/Territories in 1994-95 for special recruitment initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further information on the effectiveness of strategies aimed at women from non English speaking backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women will become available during the second phase of the Program through national reporting of results and the accreditation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other Special groups</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is noted that the report does not comment on access to the Program for women with disabilities. This point has been raised by one of the State programs in response to the Report. The issue has been discussed in national meetings and every effort will be made to ensure appropriate access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Chapter 4</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the focus of the Program remain women aged 50-69 years, but that mammographic screening continue to be available to women aged 40-49 years and 70 years and over.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is consistent with current Program policy. This policy position was devised on the basis of scientific research at the time the Program was established and for reasons of practicality. There are obvious difficulties associated with attempts to use more complex eligibility criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women aged 40-49 years will continue to have access to the Program, however, States advise women that mammography screening has only been proven to be beneficial among women over 50 years of age.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decision making in relation to the location of services either geographically or whether services will be in the private or public sectors is the responsibility of the State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a considerable effort to utilise the expertise and the mammographic capacity which already existed in the community. Many of the Services have incorporated private sector providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the basis of service delivery within the Program is the Screening and Assessment Service which is based on a multidisciplinary assessment centre. The establishment of this centre has not been a duplication as very few such centres existed. In several instances, where a private practice has operated in a mode consistent with Program policy, the whole service has been contracted to a private provider e.g. Geelong, Wagga, Cairns, and Launceston.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has concerns about Recommendation 18, and supports Recommendation 19.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Open Biopsy is currently included in the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer as the Government's preferred option. However, States have the option to not provide the Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's position has been adopted so that women who are invited for screening may have access to free investigations to the point where they can be told whether a cancer had been detected or not. It is also included for quality control reasons in that it provides a direct link between the identification of an abnormality on the mammogram and surgical removal of the lesion, thus ensuring that the correct lesion is removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is acknowledged that the inclusion of open biopsy has been contentious, including strong opposition from the various professional colleges. This view is not shared by all practitioners in the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently open biopsy is included as part of the Program in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. It will also be included in the Northern Territory when their Program begins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responses to the Senate Inquiry Report from the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales offer support for the Government's position on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One State response contends that all successful international programs promote the concept of the `multidisciplinary' team. The surgeon has an integral role in the multidisciplinary approach in clinical assessment as well as an operative role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breast surgery is increasingly seen as a speciality in its own right, shifting from the general surgery field. This specialisation allows adequate internal auditing to maintain the high level of skills required in the early detection of breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth/State agreement for the continuation of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer, which has recently been offered to all States, includes funds totalling 5% of the cost per woman screened for histological diagnosis. Payment for open biopsy will be made only on the basis of procedures performed. The method of payment for histological diagnosis will be kept under review.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and notes that it will be a major function of the National Breast Cancer Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the National Breast Cancer Centre will commence operations on 1 January 1995. A major focus of the Centre will be the development of evidence based best practice guidelines, and education and training programs for professions and the public to ensure that these are understood and implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of its terms of reference is to develop and implement educational packages for service providers across the health spectrum, women and the public on breast cancer and the best practice for screening and treatment and to undertake such evaluation of education strategies and programs as required to underpin the roles of the Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent to which this recommendation is adopted is also largely dependent on a co-ordinated approach by the various medical specialties with responsibility for the treatment and management of breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Medical Workforce Data Review Committee (MWDRC) 1993 Annual Report noted that radiation oncologists are part of a wider group of oncologists which includes medical oncologists and surgeons, and that it is important to develop effective co-ordination between these different specialties.

The concerns expressed in the recommendations will be referred to the Australian Health Ministers' Conference (AHMC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Program has not developed specific strategies in relation to radiotherapy as the provision of treatment falls outside of its area of responsibility. However, the Department of Human Services and Health has a number of strategies which deal with aspects of rural health.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 24</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That hospital based cancer registries be established as a matter of priority</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation in principle, noting that it is normally a State responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hospital based cancer registries (HBCR) have been proposed as one method by which cancer outcomes information can be collected. In response to resolutions from the Australian National Cancer Network sponsored HBCR conference, calls from health professional groups, the Senate Committee on Breast Cancer Screening and Treatment in Australia and the National Health Goals and Targets Cancer Implementation Committee, a working party has been established to examine HBCRs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Cancer Society and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare nominated representatives are working together to define the types of data required, by whom, for what purposes and in the event of a registry being set up, provide guidance as to how and when data items should be collected. The development of HBCRs in Australia would require appropriate funding from government and non-government sources, commitment from resident and visiting clinicians and hospital management, a clear set of guidelines for minimal operation and for its expanded use, and good links to State and Territory based cancer registries and other data collection agencies e.g. screening programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to facilitate this process, a draft document on HBCR minimum data set will be circulated in the near future to interested parties for comment. A study will also be commissioned on the operating costs and structure of HBCRs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 25</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That statistics collected by State and Territory cancer registries be collected on a more uniform and consistent basis and that data on cancers generally be provided to the Commonwealth government on a timely and regular basis to ensure that current national statistics on the incidence of cancers are readily available</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation in principle, noting that it has limited influence on the performance of State Cancer Registries, and that there may be significant financial implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uniformity in data collection is being addressed by the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in conjunction with the State and Territory cancer registries. At present the core set of data and the standards imposed on this data are robust and directly comparable e.g.. age, histology, personal identifiers, country of birth, place of residence. Data collected on additional features of breast cancer, or any other cancers, is less comparable. For example data on tumour size, in situ verses invasive carcinoma, stage, Aboriginal status and node status are all collected on an ad hoc basis by State and Territory cancer registries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of these data items are not amenable to collection at the State and Territory cancer registry level, but rather at the hospital based cancer registry level. For those data items which are amenable, funding is not currently available at the State and Territory based cancer registries to extend their capacity. A potential source of funds for the collection of this data is from the National Breast Cancer Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timely reporting of national cancer incidence data is dependent on the supply of data from the State and Territory cancer registries. While some cancer registries are able to provide data 18 months after the completion of the calendar year others are not able to supply data for up to four years after completion of the calendar year. The reasons for this delay are the (1) nature of cancer reporting (i.e. compilation of multiple reporting sources) (2) lack of resources (3) volume of case load (4) historical impediments (5) legislation inadequacies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the State and Territory cancer registries are attempting to improve the timeliness of the national incidence reporting. As an ongoing feature of the future national cancer incidence data reporting, projections to the current year of the common cancers, of which breast cancer is one, will be undertaken. In the meantime, many of the State and Territory cancer registries have adopted new computing technology, more efficient methods of data collection (with attempts at electronic data transfer).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with all data collections, speed of data turnaround is heavily dependent on resources, and many of the cancer registries do not have the resources and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare have to operate within financial constraints which make it difficult to significantly speed cancer data collections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will continue to encourage the States to ensure their Cancer Registries are up to date, and to transfer data to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in a timely manner. It acknowledged that this is important to the capacity to understand and to monitor breast cancer in the population. In particular information on the incidence and size of breast cancers is critical to a scientific evaluation of the success of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer. The National Program will conduct a national workshop in 1995 to explore further issues relating to this long term evaluation. State Cancer Registries will be actively involved in the workshop.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">POLICY AND PRACTICE IN RELATION TO SYMPTOMATIC WOMEN IN THE PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summary</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The National Program selects women on the basis of age alone.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Decisions on eligibility based on the presence or absence of symptoms would be impractical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.It is Program policy that women with symptoms are actively discouraged from attending the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Program has a responsibility to those women who attend for screening and who have symptoms and requires protocols to be in place for this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.It screens such women, and recommends further investigation (either within the Program or through the women's GP) regardless of the outcome of the mammogram.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rationale and Practice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of the National Program is to detect cancer sufficiently early so that prognosis is enhanced for those women found to have the disease. It aims to screen a large proportion of women in the age group for which mammography has been proven to be effective in reducing mortality&mdash;those 50-69 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the scientific trials on which the Program was based, no distinction was made between women who had symptoms and those without symptoms. Mammography was offered to all women in the appropriate age group. It can be expected then, that the mortality benefits may be anticipated where screening is offered to the whole eligible population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis on which women are eligible for screening must be clear and unequivocal. The recommendation of the Breast Cancer Screening Evaluation Committee that "a national mammography screening program should select women on the basis of age alone" provides such a basis. Generally there is no dispute about a women's age, regardless of any lack of consensus about what the age of eligibility should be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no such clarity about the meaning of "symptom". The Program defines a symptom of breast malignancy as a lump or serous or bloody nipple discharge, although it does collect information on other "symptoms" nominated by the woman or health professional or observed during screening. Women themselves may define breast pain or other signs as "symptoms". There are obvious difficulties associated with any attempt to use the presence or absence of symptoms as a primary criteria for eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any policy is only effective if it is able to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a system where women are recruited through the use of a population register and through generalised recruitment strategies, age is the only practical basis on which letters of invitation can be issued and eligibility promoted in general.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Population based mammographic screening is directed primarily at women without symptoms, and this is the practice throughout the National Program. Publicity and educational material stress that women who have symptoms should consult their general practitioner. If the practitioner considers it necessary they will be referred to the usual diagnostic services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A letter mailed to all general practitioners in September 1992, from the Commonwealth spokesperson on Women's Health, Dr Margaret Dean, stated clearly that "women who have symptoms or indications of breast malignancy should not be referred to the National Program".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all States women with symptoms are actively discouraged from attending for screening in all information available to women,&mdash;in publicity material and/or in letters. In some States women are discouraged when they attempt to make an appointment. This latter practice has ethical and resource implications in that appropriate clinical staff must be available to assess whether the woman does have symptoms, and to recommend appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another aspect of direct discouragement of this nature may be that women will disguise the presence of symptoms. Where the mammograph is then negative, the woman will not automatically receive the additional investigation (either at a Program Assessment Service, or by specific referral back to her general practitioner) she would be offered had the symptom been declared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program recognises that, whatever the discouragement, some women with symptoms will present for screening. It accepts a responsibility to those women who indicate at presentation that they have a symptom, or who insist that they will not attend elsewhere for investigation or who are unable to attend elsewhere. In these cases the women are screened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each Service is required to have a protocol governing procedures for the screening of women with symptoms. The existence of such protocols does NOT indicate that the Program encourages woman with symptoms to be screened, but is a reflection of the responsibility indicated above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing National Accreditation Guidelines require that all women in whom symptoms are identified be recommended for further assessment, regardless of the result of the mammogram. In some situations a clinical examination is performed at the time of screening. IN others women are referred to their general practitioner or recalled to an assessment clinic for further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all cases the Program policy is that the women will be advised to have significant symptoms further investigated. Where a woman has nominated a general practitioner she/he will also be provided with that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program closely monitors its performance and data will be collected and reported on the screening of women who have identified symptoms.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths in Australian women.(1) In Australia in 1990, almost 7,000 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed and in 1992 there were 2,438 deaths from breast cancer in women.(2) There has been an increase in the incidence of breast cancer in the five year period from 1983 to 1988. One woman in 15 in Australia will develop breast cancer by age 74.(1) This risk varies with age as shown in Table 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[TABLE 1 OMITTED FROM DATABASE - SEE HARD COPY PAGE 68]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Primary Prevention</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, there is little that can be done to prevent breast cancer. Major risk factors for breast cancer are non-modifiable. Known risk factors explain only about 30% of breast cancers.(3)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Major Risk Factors</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Age: Over 70% of breast cancer occurs in women who are aged 50 years or over.(1) The incidence of breast cancer and mortality from breast cancer rises with age as shown in Figure 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[FIGURE 1 OMITTED FROM DATABASE - SEE HARD COPY PAGE 68]</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Family history:</EMPHASIS> Women who have a first degree relative (mother, sister or daughter) who developed breast cancer before the age of 50 years have an increased risk of breast cancer and this risk increases with the number of first degree relatives affected. Breast cancer in one first degree relative is associated with a two-fold increase in risk, increasing if more first degree relatives are affected.(2,4) However, only about 4-5% of breast cancers are linked to family history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Genetics:</EMPHASIS> In cases of inherited breast cancer, there may be more than five genes involved with studies indicating that at least half of these involve errors in a single gene, called BRCA1.(5,6)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Previous history of breast cancer:</EMPHASIS> Women who have previously been treated for cancer in one breast have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other breast.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Benign breast disease:</EMPHASIS> Women with some forms of benign breast disease have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, particularly where biopsy indicates atypical hyperplasia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other Risk Factors</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Hormonal Factors:</EMPHASIS> Hormonal factors linked to breast cancer include early menarche, late menopause and older age at time of first full term pregnancy. A woman who does not have children has a greater risk of developing breast cancer than one who has had children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, oral contraceptives have not been shown to affect risk, however the effects with long term use from an early age are unknown.(7) Research into the role of post-menopausal oestrogen therapy has yielded contradictory findings. For each individual woman, the potential to increase the risk of breast cancer needs to be balanced against the documented beneficial effects of hormone replacement therapies in relation to osteoporosis and heart disease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Diet:</EMPHASIS> The role of diet in breast cancer is still being evaluated. There is some evidence to show there is an association Between dietary fat consumption, low fibre diets and breast cancer.(8) Alcohol consumption may be associated with breast cancer.(9)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exposure to toxic chemicals:</EMPHASIS> Exposure to chemicals, especially pesticide residues, may be a causal factor in breast cancer development.(10)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Early Detection</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best hope of reducing mortality from breast cancer currently lies in early detection. It has been demonstrated that the five-year survival rate for women with non-localised breast cancer is less than 60%, with survival increasing to 91% if the cancer is detected and treated at a localised stage. The survival rate approaches 100% if the cancer is detected in situ.(11)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are four methods of early detection:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Breast self examination (BSE)</EMPHASIS> Meta-analysis of studies investigating BSE have shown that the tumours detected by women practising BSE tend to be smaller and have less axillary node involvement than those in women not practising BSE. However, improvements in survival rates in women practising BSE have yet to be demonstrate.(12)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recommendation: The Australian Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that women over 35 years of age practise BSE monthly.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Physical examination by a doctor</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, there do not appear to have been any trials examining the impact of physical breast examination by a doctor on survival from breast cancer. However, it seems likely that such examinations would improve the rate of early detection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that women who are having screening mammograms continue to receive an examination from their doctor and to practise BSE, as up to 30% of breast cancers will develop as a palpable lump between screening mammograms, even when the previous mammogram is normal.(13)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recommendation: The ACS recommends that every woman from age 40 has a clinical breast examination as a part of a routine annual examination. The policy of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is that regular clinical examination should be offered because not all breast cancers can be detected by mammography.</EMPHASIS>(14</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mammography</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Screening mammogram can detect cancers which are too small to be found through physical examination. It is the most effective method available to detect breast cancer at an early stage when conservative treatment and a successful recovery are more likely.(15,16)  A mammogram can identify a very small tumour well before the lump can be palpated or before there are any symptoms or signs of breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overseas research into screening mammography programs has demonstrated significant reductions in breast cancer mortality. The National Cancer Institute held an International Workshop on Screening for Breast Cancer in 1993 to conduct a review of the most recent clinical trial data on breast cancer screening, including eight major randomized controlled trials from around the world.(17) Every study found a protective effect due to screening for women in the 50-69 year age group of around 30-35%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For women in the 40-49 year age group, there was no reduction in mortality from breast cancer attributable to screening in the first 5-7 years after entry and an uncertain marginal reduction in mortality at about 10-12 years.(17) The breast tissue of younger women is more fibrous and dense than that of older women, making mammography less accurate. This may result in a higher recall rate, higher benign to malignancy biopsy rate and a lower cancer detection rate.(18,19) The National Health and Medical Research Council state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening women under 50 years.(20)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general practitioner has a vital role to play in encouraging eligible women to attend for mammographic screening. Australian research has shown that up to 90% of women will attend for screening following a recommendation from their general practitioner.(21)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recommendation: The ACS recommends screening mammography for women over 50 years. RACGP policy is that mammography is the most useful tool currently available to detect asymptomatic breast cancers.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Screening Mammography</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What is Screening Mammography</EMPHASIS>?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Screening mammography is performed in an organised and systematic manner in women without any symptoms or signs of breast cancer, so that early treatment may improve the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike screening mammography, diagnostic mammography is for women who have breast symptoms or signs which require investigation. Diagnostic mammography is normally performed in conjunction with clinical assessment and other investigations, particularly breast ultrasound, fine needle aspiration and biopsy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women with breast symptoms should be referred to an appropriate service for diagnostic mammography by their general practitioner. They should not be referred to a screening mammography service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What are the Benefits of Screening Mammography</EMPHASIS>?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is evidence to show that screening mammography is the most effective method available to detect breast cancer at an early stage when conservative treatment and a successful recovery are more likely.(1,2) A mammogram may identify a very small tumour well before the lump can be palpated and before there are any symptoms of breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overseas research has demonstrated that screening mammography programs can result in significant reductions in breast cancer mortality.(3,4,5) However, a review of major randomized controlled trials on screening mammography from around the world found that no significant reduction in mortality has been demonstrated in women aged under 50 years.(6)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What Is the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer (NPEDBC) is jointly funded by the Commonwealth and State Governments. A network of dedicated, accredited Screening and Assessment Services is being established throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each Screening and Assessment Service consists of a number of screening units (fixed site ant mobile), affiliated with an assessment centre. By July 1994, 87 screening locations had been established throughout Australia. These are located in both the private and public sector. Assessment centres provide further investigation of women with screen detected abnormalities in order to provide a definitive diagnosis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Who is Eligible for Screening within the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility for screening by the NPEDBC is based on age. The NPEDBC targets women aged 50-69 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women aged 40-49 years and 70-79 years may also attend for screening, if they wish but they are not targeted for recruitment by the NPEDBC. The increased ratiodensity of the breast tissue of younger women limits the accuracy of screening mammography. It is recommended that women from age 35 years be encouraged to practise breast self examination and report any changes in their breasts to their general practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women who present with a lump or symptoms of breast disease should not be referred to the Program. A Medicare rebate is available for diagnostic mammography for these women. If it is subsequently found that there is no evidence of malignancy, then these women can be screened within the Program if they are over 40 years and at the appropriate interval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women who have a family history of breast cancer may be referred to the screening program if aged over 40 years, or alternatively to a private radiologist. In this situation, the mammogram attracts a Medicare rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What are the Main Features of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NPEDBC includes recruitment, screening ant when required, assessment up to and including histological or cytological diagnosis of breast cancer. Some States do not currently provide open biopsy as part of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Services are provided by staff with appropriate expertise, experience and training. Assessment is undertaken by multidisciplinary teams with expertise in radiology, pathology and breast surgery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The service is FREE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women aged 50-69 years are systematically recruited to the NPEDBC by letter, through media campaigns and through other strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women are routinely recalled for a mammogram every two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women are screened with two new mammography (cranio-cautal and mediolateral oblique).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All mammograms are taken by a radiographer specially trained in screening mammography.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All films are read and reported independently by two or more doctors, at least one of whom must be a radiologist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Screening and assessment is carried out at services accredited in accordance with the National Program Standards and Requirements for Accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of the screening and assessment are provided directly to the woman and to her nominated general practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What happens to women when they are screened in the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recruitment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Personalised invitations based on the electoral roll are sent to women aged 50-69 years. Other promotional strategies are also used. Women who attend for screening are sent a letter reminding them to have a repeat mammogram every two years. They will be re invited at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Appointment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women are required to telephone to make an appointment for mammogram. A woman may telephone 13 2050 from anywhere in Australia and she will be connected automatically to the Screening and Assessment Service closest to where she is telephoning. Special arrangements may be made for non-English speaking women. Ethnic health and bilingual health workers can organise appointments and transport for non-English speaking women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Screening</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All staff are trained to deal sensitively with women who attend the Program. When women attend for screening, they will be provided with information about what to expect and asked to complete a few personal details, including a consent form for screening. Women will be asked to undress from the waist up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Results</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The woman and her nominated general practitioner are notified in writing within 14 days of the mammogram if the result is normal. If the woman needs further investigation she and her nominated general practitioner are notified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Follow-up and assessment of screen detected abnormalities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Out of every 100 women screened, less than 10 women will be recalled for assessment. Women with screen detected abnormalities are followed up within 14 days of the initial screening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the women recalled will not have breast cancer. Some recalls will be due to technical problems with the first mammogram. Less than 1% of women screened will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Further assessment may include physical examination of the breasts, repeat specialised mammography, ultrasound, fine needle aspiration and biopsy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Open surgical biopsy is offered free within the NPEDBC in the ACT, NSW, Victoria and Western Australia. lf a surgical biopsy is required, the woman can choose to have it performed by a surgeon associated with the Program or be referred to a surgeon by her general practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The screening service aims to notify the woman's nominated general practitioner on the day with regard to a recommendation for open biopsy or where a cancer is diagnosed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Counselling is available to all women attending for assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Treatment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Program does not provide treatment for women with breast cancer. However, it refers women for treatment and collects data on treatment outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women diagnosed with breast cancer can choose to select their own surgeon after discussion with their general practitioner or can choose to be treated by surgeons associated with the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What is the Role of the General Practitioner in Relation to the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research suggests that general practitioners in Australia play a vital role in encouraging women to participate in screening mammography. As a general practitioner, you can assist women to participate in the Program by:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Common Questions from Patients about Breast Cancer</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Are all women at risk of developing breast cancer?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, all women are at risk. Known risk factors for breast cancer are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">advancing age</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a family history of breast cancer involving a first degree relative (mother, daughter or sister)</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the presence of particular genes which are currently the focus of much research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, known risk factors explain only about 30% of breast cancers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Can physical breast examination detect all breast cancers?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breast examination cannot detect all breast cancers. Breast self examination can find a lump approximately the size of a grape. Breast examination by a doctor can find a lump approximately the size of a pea and a screening mammogram can find a tumour approximately the size of a grain of rice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What is a mammogram</EMPHASIS>?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What is a screening mammogram?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A screening mammogram is for women who do not have breast lumps, nipple discharge or other breast changes The purpose of a screening mammogram is to detect unsuspected breast cancer at an early stage so that early treatment occurs. If treatment is commenced early then it is less likely to involve the removal of the breast and early treatment is more likely to result in a successful recovery.(2,3)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">I am 35 years old, can I have a screening mammogram through the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer (NPEDBC)?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women under 40 years of age are not eligible to have a screening mammogram within the NPEDBC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Results from overseas studies have not suggested that women aged under 50 years will benefit from mammographic screening.(3) In addition, the breast tissue of younger women is more fibrous and dense than that of older women, making mammography less accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Are screening mammograms accurate? Do they find all breast cancers?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No test is 100% accurate, including screening mammograms. Screening mammograms may not find all breast cancers. However, having a screening mammogram is at present the most effective method available to find breast cancer early.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Do women with small breasts need screening mammography to detect breast cancer?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women with small breasts have the same risk of developing breast cancer as women with larger breasts. At present mammography is the most effective technique for detecting small breast cancers in all women, including those with small breasts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Will having a screening mammogram hurt?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the mammogram discomfort may be felt for a few seconds whilst the breast is being compressed. Compression of the breast is necessary so that more of the breast tissue can be seen. If the breast is not compressed properly, the mammogram will not be as clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most women report that a mammogram is not uncomfortable and not painful.(4) Women whose breasts are tender before their period, may find it more comfortable to have a mammogram during or just after a period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Can a screening mammogram be harmful?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women are exposed to only a small amount of radiation from a screening mammogram. The compression used during a mammogram decreases the amount of radiation the woman is exposed to. There is no evidence that mammograms cause breast cancer.(5)  There is no evidence that the pressure placed on the breasts during a mammogram damages the breast tissue or causes a cancer to spread.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">How often should screening mammograms be performed?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All women between 50-69 years should have a screening mammogram every two years. Overseas research has shown that two yearly screening mammograms among women aged over 50 will significantly reduce death from breast cancer.(3) The NPEDBC will send women a reminder letter when their next visit is due.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">How long will it take to have a mammogram?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two X-rays are taken of each breast. Having a mammogram only takes a few minutes. However, about 30 minutes may be required for the whole procedure, including the completion of forms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What clothes should a woman wear when she has a screening mammogram?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is easier for the woman if she wears a two-piece outfit, such as a skirt and blouse or trousers and blouse. It is recommended that she does not use ***** talcum powder or deodorant before she attends for her mammogram, as it may interfere with the clarify of the mammogram.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Should a woman take anything along with her when she has a screening mammogram?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the woman has had previous mammograms, she should take them with her to her screening visit and she should take reading glasses if she needs them to complete forms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She should also take her general practitioner's name and address to the screening unit. This enables the unit to send her general practitioner a copy of the results, if she agrees to this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Who will get the results of the mammogram?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of the mammogram will be given to the woman by mail or telephone, within 14 days of having had the mammogram. At the time of screening, the woman will be asked to nominate a general practitioner to receive a copy of the results. The National Program encourages women to nominate a general practitioner to whom their results will be sent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">A woman reports that she was called by the screening centre and was told that her mammogram had an abnormality that needed further assessment. What does this mean?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If something is found on the mammogram or if there was a technical problem with the mammogram, the woman will be recalled for further investigation. Further investigation may include a repeat mammogram, ultrasound, fine needle aspiration or a needle biopsy. She will be invited to attend for assessment within 14 days of the initial mammogram. Most abnormalities detected by a screening mammogram are not breast cancer. Of 10 women recalled for further assessment, less than 1 will have breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The woman will be asked to nominate a general practitioner to be notified of her need for assessment and the results of assessment. The general practitioner will be notified by mail or telephone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What is the cost to women of having a screening mammogram?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All services provided by the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer are free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">How can women be sure that the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer is as good as possible?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of the Screening and Assessment units within the National Program are required to meet national accreditation standards. Accreditation aims to ensure successful performance in a quality assurance program and covers such aspects as the minimum number of women each radiographer in the Program must screen each year, the requirement for two independent film readers (one of whom must be a radiologist) and the timeframe within which women are notified of the results of their mammogram.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">If breast cancer is found, does it mean that the breast needs to be removed?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The treatment for breast cancer depends on the size of the cancer, whether it has spread or not and the woman's general health. All the possible treatment options will be discussed with the woman so that she may make an informed choice which  is right for her. The main types of treatment are surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Treatment may involve a combination of these types of treatment. Surgery may involve:</PARA>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS AND SECURITIES ON THE CLOSE CORPORATIONS ACT 1989</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document provides the Government's response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the Close Corporations Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities adopted its reference to investigate the Close Corporations Act 1989 in June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The terms of reference were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . (to) inquire into the creation of a new corporate form tailored to meet the needs of small business. The Committee will examine the unproclaimed Close Corporations Act 1989. That Act had as its object the simplification of the corporate rules for small business by reducing financial and other reporting requirements and by abandoning the company law distinction between directors and shareholders in favour of simple principles based on partnership laws. The Committee will also examine suggested amendments to that Act and other corporate structures having the same broad objectives."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The Committee received 31 written submissions in the course of its reference, and held hearings in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. 21 people appeared as witnesses at the Committee's public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Committee's report was completed in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Close Corporations Act 1989</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The Close Corporations Act was passed in 1989, but has never been proclaimed. It was affected by the same constitutional difficulties as were found to affect the Corporations Act 1989 in the High Court case of New South Wales v the Commonwealth (1990) ALR 355. The Act has never been amended to overcome these problems. The Close Corporations Act 1989 was designed to enable the adoption of simpler corporate rules for small business by reducing financial and other reporting requirements imposed on small companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendations by the Parliamentary Joint Committee</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The Committee's central conclusion was that a new form of company, to be known as the `private company' should be created and that the Close Corporations Act should be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The main recommendations of the Committee's report were that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the minimum number of members of the private company should be 2</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the maximum number of members of the private company should be 10</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the private company should not have the capacity to act as a trustee or holding company</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">private companies should not be required to keep accounts</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the new rules for private companies should be accompanied by a Guide, written in plain language, for potential users of the corporate structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The Government thanks the members of the Committee, whose work has ensured that the important issues under consideration have been widely debated and that those with an interest in the issues have had ample opportunity to express their views. The Government also thanks those who presented evidence to the Committee, both orally and by way of written submissions. The hearings conducted by the Committee, and the submissions received by it, elicited a clear picture of the issues affecting small businesses which operate through the company structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Public submissions on the Committee's report</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. In July 1993, the Attorney-General's Department issued a paper entitled `Discussion Paper: Report of Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities on the Close Corporations Act 1989'. That paper invited public comments on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. Over 50 submissions were received in response to the Discussion Paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. The vast majority of submissions agreed with the Committee's view that there is a need to streamline the regulation of small companies. However, the submissions also indicated that there was a significant level of concern regarding some of the proposed features of the private company. In particular, there was concern about:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the limitations on the powers and capacities of the private company, such as its inability to act as a trustee or a holding company or to issue more than one class of shares; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the requirement for a minimum of 2 members and the implication that there would be a minimum of 2 directors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Establishment of the Simplification Task Force</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. In October 1993, the Attorney-General announced the appointment of a Task Force to simplify the Corporations Law. In December 1993, the Task Force announced its 7 initial areas of priority in simplifying the Law. One of these was the corporate structure for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. The Committee's report provided an invaluable starting point for the work of the Task Force in its consideration of this issue. The Task Force also had the advantage of the public submissions that had been received in response to the Discussion Paper on the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">First Corporate Law Simplification Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. In March 1994, the Attorney-General released for public comment a Task Force proposal for simplification of the rules governing the corporate structure used by small business. Having received submissions on that (as well as 2 other proposals for simplification of other areas of the Corporations Law), a draft Bill prepared by the Task Force was released in July 1994. Under the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill, proprietary companies:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">will be able to have one member and/or director</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">will not be required to prepare annual financial statements for Corporations Law purposes, unless they are `large' companies (on the basis of 3 objective tests), or 5% of members or the ASC requires their preparation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">will not be required to hold annual general meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. In addition, a small business guide will be included as part of the Law. This guide will be in plain language and it is envisaged that it will also be published separately from the Law.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1993 the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts presented to the Senate a Report entitled Water Resources&mdash;Toxic Algae.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Response has been prepared in conjunction with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of Finance, the Department of Housing and Regional Development, the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and relevant areas of the Environment Portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government generally supports the intent of the Report, many of the recommendations have significant potential budgetary and resource implications. The Government would need to consider and prioritise the recommendations within the normal budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overview</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth sees the management of algal blooms as an issue of national significance and welcomes the Senate Committee's Report and its recommendations. The Commonwealth is actively developing, in</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">co-operation with the States and Territories, a nationally consistent approach to algal bloom management. This approach is in line with the Commonwealth's role in water resources management of providing policy leadership and national coordination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Policies and programs aimed at the reduction of the impacts of algal blooms are being actively pursued through the development and implementation of national, State and catchment based strategies. These strategies have adopted a multi-faceted approach and address both the impacts of blooms should they occur, and the causes of algal blooms. The strategies include the development of algal bloom contingency plans, management of streamflow, long term nutrient management and research. However, even when such strategies are in place it can be expected that blooms will be frequent at least for another decade as a result of phosphorus stored in the waterways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the December 1992 Statement on the Environment , the Prime Minister set out the Commonwealth's commitment to assist in the improvement of the water quality of Australia's river systems. The initiatives announced in that Statement are designed to address nationally significant water quality issues and to act as a catalyst for States and local community action on their most immediate water quality problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Government is injecting more than $70 million over four years to improve catchment management and water quality throughout the country, including efforts to address the causes of algal blooms. The Commonwealth is looking to catchment management processes to lead the development and implementation of the sustainable use of natural resources. Water quality is a particularly sensitive measure of sustainability. This is best achieved through planning and implementation processes involving consultation with, and the effective participation of, the full range of stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A high priority will be given to addressing point sources of nutrient pollution which are an important contributor to the formation of algal blooms. Point sources arising from waste water, irrigation drainage, stormwater and effluent discharge will be targeted through better management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While high priority is given to projects addressing point source pollution, a significant proportion of the available funding will be used to address diffuse source pollution in a whole catchment context. It is difficult to accurately assess the relative contribution of nutrients from diffuse or dispersed agricultural run-off and other potential sources. Diffuse nutrient loads enters waterways principally from run-off and soil erosion during high flow events and over a broad geographical area. Their primary control rests with land use planning, the promotion of `best management practices and construction of catchment water quality control works such as artificial wetlands, riparian buffer strips and fencing of water course margins to prevent livestock access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Water Quality Management Strategy (NWQMS), as a joint initiative of the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) and the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) is being developed in response to growing community concern about the gradual deterioration in the quality of the nation's water bodies. The Strategy will set an overall strategic direction for water quality management and is based on the principles of the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development. The objective for the NWQMS is `to achieve sustainable use of the nation's water resources by protecting and enhancing their quality while maintaining economic and social development.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the emphasis put on the NWQMS by the Senate Committee in its recommendations. There are, however, a number of recommendations referring to the NWQMS that fall outside its scope. Consequently other measures will be necessary to advance these recommendations. These are noted in the discussion of the specific recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NWQMS provides a national framework for the protection of surface water and groundwater quality throughout Australia by the development of high status guidelines which act as the point of reference when water quality is determined on a case-by-case basis. This approach provides a shared national objective while allowing flexibility to respond to differing regional and local circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Strategy proposes the adoption of a package of complementary regulatory and market-based measures to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. The adoption of `user pays' and `polluter pays' policies can ensure that resource users bear the costs associated with the use of water resources rather than pass them on to society as a whole. Other measures which could be adopted to maintain and protect water quality include adoption of minimum wastewater discharge guidelines or standards set on the basis of modern accepted technology or a requirement to install modern and efficient technology in new developments. Community consultation and involvement is integral to the successful implementation of the Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first phase of the NWQMS was launched in August 1992 with the release of a series of discussion papers and draft guidelines for public comment. Three key elements of the Strategy have been finalised, namely, Policies and Principles&mdash;A Reference Document and Water Quality Management&mdash;An Outline of the Policies which address the underlying philosophy and principles of the Strategy, and Australian Water Quality Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters which provides guidance for the application of scientifically based water quality criteria as part of the process for setting water quality objectives for particular waterbodies. A current status report on the Strategy is at Attachment 1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4 of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment envisages the establishment of the National Environment Protection Council (NEPC) which is a Ministerial Council between Commonwealth and participating State and Territory Ministers. The main objective of NEPC is to develop and pass national environment protection measures (NEPMs) such as standards, guidelines, goals or protocols. NEPMs are to be developed inter alia for ambient marine, estuarine and freshwater quality. The NEPMs will take account of natural variations of parameters under consideration. Adoption of NEPMs should help in preventing algal blooms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complementary Commonwealth/State legislation is needed for NEPC to be established. At the COAG meeting in February 1994, all participating jurisdictions agreed to introduce legislation to establish NEPC as soon as possible. The Commonwealth introduced its NEPC Bill in June 1994. All participating States and Territories have indicated their readiness to enact their respective NEPC Bills by the end of 1994. Thus NEPC should be operational in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council of Australian Governments agreed, at a meeting in February 1994, to a package of measures for water reform which include issues pertaining to water quality and allocation and is also relevant to the Committee's recommendations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primary responsibility for water resource management belongs to State, Territory and local government. While additional funding support was announced in the Prime Minister's December 1992 Statement on the Environment, this support is designed to act as a catalyst for more effective management of sewage treatment works. It is not the intention of the Commonwealth to maintain an ongoing funding program to upgrade sewage treatment works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Priority is being given by the Commonwealth to the immediate assessment and early implementation, in consultation with State and local governments, of the most effective and efficient methods of improving the sewage treatment plants at ten centres responsible for the majority of the sewage nutrients entering the Darling River system.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Country Towns Water Supply Improvement Program was extended to include waste water treatment for small rural communities at a cost of $16 million over a period of four years. The extension of small towns management activities to include waste water treatment will help improve water quality for the environment and other users. In 1993-94 as a result of the Statement the Commonwealth provided assistance of $4.5 million to 41 wastewater projects in small centres under the water services element of the National Landcare Program.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, following receipt of the forthcoming ARMCANZ report, a review of policies at all levels of government be conducted to ensure the consideration of alternative sewage treatment options when upgrading sewerage systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced in the Prime Minister's 1992 Environment Statement that a major new emphasis in Commonwealth water management programs would be placed on facilitating low cost, effective wastewater treatment and disposal, utilising Australian expertise and technology. As a result the water services elements of the National Landcare Program are being reshaped to assist, wherever possible, the demonstration of alternative technologies and measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, where NLP assistance is provided, the Commonwealth seeks undertakings from State and local water authorities to the opening of tender processes to allow opportunities for Australian suppliers of alternative sewage treatment options and management approaches. This assistance helps alleviate uncertainties some water service providers may have in adopting new technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth also provides assistance for projects that enhance awareness by water service providers of new wastewater management technologies and their application. Through the NLP, it is funding preparation of a compendium of small town management technologies for use by local government and regional sewerage authorities. It is also funding a nationwide analysis of the relative costs of delivering water services which is designed to enhance awareness of the costs and relative performance of alternative technologies and approaches. A study of economic instruments that may encourage innovative measures for the reuse or reduction of wastewaters is also being funded. The results of these projects are expected to be available early in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends the implementation of policies by the relevant authorities at all levels of government stipulating achievable minimum effluent standards for point source nutrient pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is mainly a State and Territory responsibility. The matter will also be referred to ANZECC and ARMCANZ for their consideration in the development of the NWQMS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The technology for stringent effluent standards or guidelines for point source nutrient levels is available. Such standards or guidelines would encourage use of best available technology. Achievement of such standards or guidelines may require significant expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environments differ in their assimilative capacities. It would therefore be desirable if, within broad guidelines, effluent standards reflected different local and regional conditions. Mechanisms should also be available to ensure that a locality's total assimilative capacity is not exceeded over time as new sources of effluent are established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any discharge should not cause local ambient water concentrations to exceed guidelines such as the ANZECC Water Quality Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters or (at some future date) any national environment protection measures that NEPC may have introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The factors relevant to algal bloom formation have inherently wide ranges, for example, naturally occurring phosphorus concentrations in rivers, the number and nature of other discharges nearby, flow rates of rivers and other factors such as turbidity. It is therefore preferable to assess the effluent concentration requirements on a case by case basis. This should however, be subject to general guidelines including the precautionary principle. Additionally, the ANZECC Water Quality Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Waters also recommend that site specific studies are needed to determine the potential for undesirable algal growth in waterbodies.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter will be referred to ARMCANZ and ANZECC for their consideration in the development of the NWQMS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application of treated sewage to land provides water and nutrients to growing crops, trees or pastures and at the same time reduces sewage discharge to waterways. On the negative side, however, as has been raised in relation to groundwater protection in the NWQMS, application of waste water to land can result in groundwater contamination. Contaminants such as heavy metals, high organics, nutrients, faecal bacteria, viruses and protozoa can make their way into groundwater from sewage effluent. These hazards need to be assessed to see how significant they are and how they can be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC), in conjunction with ANZECC and ARMCANZ, is developing guidelines on the land disposal of sewerage sludge and other uses for sludge such as for fuels.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Local Government Phosphorus Action Plan is a professional multi-disciplinary program designed to mobilise communities to act to substantially improve water quality and create a measurable and sustained reduction in the phosphorus inflow into sewage treatment works and from urban and rural run off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A leading initiative in the NSW Local Government Phosphorus Action Plan is a pilot phosphorus awareness and reduction campaign project being trialled in the Albury area. The project is undertaking a comprehensive urban nutrient management study to achieve lower phosphate levels in waterways. The project is being supported under the National Landcare Program. The Albury campaign has the potential to provide a model for similar activities on a national basis. This pilot project has generated interest nationally as part of an overall strategy to minimise nutrients entering our waterways through the raising of public awareness of the environmental impacts of the use of phosphorus enriched products or wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The generation of constructive community responses through such initiatives may impact on the level of phosphorus in detergents, as well as affecting the levels of phosphorus entering waterways from other sources.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 9</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that if a significant reduction in levels of phosphorus in detergents has not been achieved within two years then legislation be enacted to reduce levels or to ban phosphates in detergents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration of this recommendation should be deferred until the ANZECC/ARMCANZ national approach on phosphorus in detergents has been developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This strategy will review the relationship between phosphorus and algal blooms, sources of phosphorus in waterways and wastewater treatment options. Measures to reduce phosphorus accessions to be discussed include the effectiveness of detergent formulation changes, economic measures and enhanced sewage treatment. It should be noted that reducing or eliminating phosphorus in detergents may not be enough to have a significant impact on reducing algal blooms while there are other sources of phosphorus reaching waterways and while there is already a store of phosphates in streams and sediments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of legislation is unlikely to be the most cost effective mechanism for implementing phosphorus reductions. Nor is it likely to be the most acceptable mechanism from an industry perspective. A preferable approach would be the application of an economic instrument to provide an incentive for producers to reduce phosphorus content. The level of these charges could initially be set at a rate which acknowledges the cost of implementation and adjustment and which may increase over time as costs are fully absorbed. This would provide producers with greater certainty and also serve to address timing issues raised in recommendation 10.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government give consideration to providing the necessary resources for the collation and analysis of the available historical data on algal blooms, nutrient levels and flow rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Commonwealth and State agencies hold a large amount of historical natural resource data, including information on water quality and quantity. To assist the effective management of this information, governments through the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (1992), agreed to a schedule on data collection and handling. The schedule identifies the Australian and New Zealand Land Information Council as responsible for facilitating the effective management of land related data held by various agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Constitution, State Governments are responsible for management of water resources, and historically have undertaken the major role of data collection and management. The Commonwealth would see any data collation and analysis exercises operating within the existing state frameworks and therefore for States to continue with the primary role of data collection and storage. Analysis of relevant water information which is found to be necessary could be undertaken by making use of State data files rather than duplicating information through the establishment of a centralised data-base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Commonwealth level, agencies holding such information include the Environmental Resources Information Network, Australian Surveying and Land Information Group, National Resources </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information Centre, Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. A number of these agencies have established data sharing arrangements between themselves and with state natural resource agencies and other institutions including universities, museums, etc. The existence of such agreements negates the need to centralise (and therefore duplicate) all existing data within a Commonwealth agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is cautious in some respects over the value of historical data collation and analysis, given the often inconsistent nature of the historical data. The aim of this activity is to identify trends in historical water quality and quantity data and to use this data to forecast whether current conditions are likely to initiate algal blooms. The Murray River is probably the best historically monitored river system in Australia, with data on flow rates available from about the 1930's. However, it is interesting that even here, where there is the best chance of using existing historic data for trend analysis, the Inquiry's Report (para 3.41) notes that, `the existing network of permanent monitoring sites in the Murray-Darling Basin does not provide sufficient information on the development of algal blooms'. Data available on most other river systems only goes back to the 1970's, which in terms of use for identifying trends presents some difficulties due to the relatively short time period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency has commissioned a report on Water Quality Monitoring in Australia, which is due for completion in 1994. This report is expected to include recommendations on long term monitoring and data sets. Long term monitoring will be important for State of the Environment reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LWRRDC is also supporting the analysis of long term data sets for algae in the Murray River and is supervising research projects into options for managing algal blooms through the manipulation of stream flows under the National River Health Program. See also comments on Recommendation 42.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is aware that ARMCANZ has the development of a national data base on its agenda and will await the outcome of any decisions in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 29</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that consideration be given to the establishment of a number of long-term national reference monitoring sites.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter will be referred to ANZECC and ARMCANZ for their consideration in the development of the NWQMS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Monitoring River Health Initiative (MRHI) is establishing, in collaboration with the States and Territories under the National River Health Program, a wide range of reference and monitoring sites for biological monitoring using mainly macro invertebrates. Some more limited work will be done at these sites on macrophytes and algae. Such MRHI sites could also serve as long term national reference sites.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actions outlined in the recommendation may not necessarily be the optimal approach. As with the above recommendation, it is considered that the actions can already be achieved through existing monitoring programs and data sharing agreements. Given the range of Commonwealth and State river monitoring sites already in existence, it is unlikely that new sites need be established. Instead, data from existing sites could, in addition to their current functions, also contribute to the national monitoring effort. In particular, it is noted that the supporting text states that "in some situations there may only need to be selective increases in the quality of existing monitoring programs to include long term data".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 30</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the development of new legislation or other regulatory measures be required to demonstrate that due consideration has been given to the link between the natural resource industries and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (1992) the Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that any new legislation or other regulatory measures recognise the link between natural resource industries and the environment. The Agreement establishes a series of broad principles to guide the development and implementation of environmental policies and programs. The NWQMS and the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development also emphasise the importance of links between the natural resources industries and the environment. The principles underlying these initiatives include the adoption of a precautionary approach to environmental issues and the effective integration of environmental and economic considerations in decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent COAG Water Resource Policy Report acknowledges the importance of government water reform action taking full account of the link between natural resource industries and the environment. For instance, the Report recommends that governments, where they have not already done so, develop administrative arrangements and decision-making processes which embrace an integrated approach to natural resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulatory mechanisms</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 31</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that as part of the development of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, regulatory mechanisms be reviewed to ensure that the respective responsibilities and roles of various government agencies are clearly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter will be addressed in the context of action following the COAG Water Resource Policy Report, in particular Recommendation 6c. (See Attachment 2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The COAG Water Resource Policy Report notes that institutional arrangements surrounding natural resource management are not as clearly defined as they might be and regulatory functions are not always separated from service delivery. This has contributed to an overlap of responsibilities in some areas in relation to the trustee for the resources, establishing and enforcing regulatory requirements and service delivery. COAG has endorsed the principle that, as far as possible, the roles of water resource management, standard setting and regulatory enforcement and service provision be separated institutionally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incentive schemes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 32</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that as part of the development of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, consideration be given to the effectiveness of incentive schemes for improving agricultural techniques in relation to maintaining water quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is supported in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NWQMS promotes the use of market based incentive measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investigations into incentive schemes will need to be aware that such schemes can become de facto subsidies shielding farmers from economic and environmental signals and resulting in inefficient outcomes. Such subsidies can also lead to poor equity and economic efficiency outcomes. Government initiatives should have regard to the user pays, beneficiary pays and polluter pays principles to signal the need for farmers to move to ecologically sustainable production methods early to forestall reducing productivity levels and increasing production costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has established a Working Group with members from DPIE (ABRE/BRS), DEST, DoF, Treasury and DIST to undertake a scoping study of economic measures which might reduce nutrients in Australia's water bodies. This will include an assessment of the potential use and effectiveness of a range of economic measures, with the aim of identifying, if appropriate, specific economic measures which may practically and feasibly promote practices to reduce nutrients in run-off. This Group is to report to Cabinet by February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the objectives of the National Landcare Program is to encourage a self-help attitude and capacity in locally based community groups in planning, promoting and implementing sustainable land use practices, including activities designed to assist in maintaining water quality. This is achieved by providing incentives and a framework for groups to understand the nature, extent and relative importance of land and water use problems; and to identify and acquire the information and skills needed to develop, apply and demonstrate practical solutions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter will be referred to ARMCANZ and ANZECC for their consideration in the development of the NWQMS, in particular the Water Quality Implementation Handbook, a document that outlines procedures for the implementation of the NWQMS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community education forms a significant component of a range of DPIE and DEST water-related programs, including aspects of the Waterwatch, Community Landcare and Natural Resource Management Strategy programs. The Commonwealth considers that while it may be appropriate to continue well-targeted extension services, the generally high levels of community awareness of resource use/environmental issues, show that there may be some scope to re-focus funding to more directly target water reform objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preventative action</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 34</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that as part of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, a review be conducted of government policies to establish whether there is potential to provide incentives for members of the community to undertake preventative actions in relation to maintaining water quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter is more appropriately addressed through Commonwealth funding programs such as the National Landcare Program and the Waterwatch program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the objectives of the National Landcare Program is to encourage a self-help attitude and capacity by locally based community groups in planning, promoting and implementing sustainable land use practices, including activities designed to assist in maintaining water quality. This is achieved by providing incentives and a framework for groups to understand the nature, extent and relative importance of land and water use problems; and to identify and acquire the information and skills needed to develop, apply and demonstrate practical solutions. An outline of the National Landcare Program and its components is at Attachment 3.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Waterwatch Program and other educational and community awareness incentives already provide incentives for community members to undertake preventative actions in relation to maintaining water quality. Waterwatch, for example, is a national umbrella encompassing Streamwatch, Frog watch, Saltwatch, Rivers of Blue and other water watch type programs. A national strategy and protocols and standards for data collection and recording through Telecom Nexus storage base have been developed and will be used by over 600 community groups throughout Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the development of performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of outcomes of proposed strategies in relation to water quality be an integral part of integrated catchment management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter should be referred to ANZECC and ARMCANZ for their consideration in the development of the NWQMS, in particular the Guidelines on Water Quality Monitoring and Reporting. These Guidelines will provide a framework for a nationally consistent approach to water quality monitoring and reporting and will focus on resource assessment, identification and reporting on the current status and trends in water quality. As mentioned for recommendations 29 and 35, the MRHI will provide for long term biological monitoring to assess ecosystem health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Performance indicators are needed to gauge accurately the effectiveness of its water management strategies. DPIE and DEST in developing performance measures will ensure those measures allow an assessment of how well the programs have contributed to the Commonwealth's water reform agenda including agreed COAG water reform measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evaluation of the effectiveness of measures undertaken under the umbrella of catchment management activities will be an essential requirement for support under the National Landcare Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Integrated catchment management</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that adequate funding of integrated catchment management bodies be ensured, possibly as a proportion of the total expenditure on resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A high proportion of Commonwealth landcare funding is now being directed towards integrated catchment management activities. In 1993-94 the Commonwealth through the National Landcare Program provided $11.5 million for agreed Commonwealth/State integrated catchment initiatives. The Commonwealth also contributed $6.9 million towards the Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Strategy, which is heavily focused on integrated catchment management and $5.7 million towards the Murray-Darling Basin Drainage Program which augments integrated catchment management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be considerable program management difficulties in guaranteeing a minimum percentage of funding for integrated catchment management. There is a range of priorities for attention in natural resource management, which are all inter-connected and whose relative priority can change quickly. A guaranteed percentage of funding for any one area of activity will reduce the flexibility available in dealing with other and related priority issues. Furthermore, such agreed minimum percentages of funding will constrain governments in responding to funding of future natural resource management contingencies. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the current level of Commonwealth Government funding for research be maintained if not increased, and that consideration be given to long-term funding security for approved research projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future Commonwealth funding levels for all programs, including algal research, need to be considered in the Budget context and to take into account the Government's medium term fiscal objective of reducing the Budget deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. However, the Government is providing secure, long-term funding to research agencies involved in algal research, such as the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation (LWRRDC) and the Centres for Co-operative Research. The ongoing funding commitment for LWRRDC is $11.1 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition the Government has also provided $10 million over four years under the 1992 Statement on the Environment to carry out scientific water quality monitoring projects. This money has been combined with additional funds from LWRRDC under the National River Health Program which has a focus on scientific water monitoring and environmental flow requirements including R&amp;D and management options for blue green algae blooms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The length of funding for research projects is a matter for the managers of the agency to decide.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.1At its meeting on 8-9 June 1993 the Council of Australian Governments asked that a Working Group of officials, under an independent chair, prepare a report for its next meeting containing a strategic framework for the efficient and sustainable reform of the water industry, having regard to the technical and policy diversity that currently exists across the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.2The water industry in Australia has over $90 billion invested in it in replacement cost terms. The bulk of this investment, some $50 billion, is in urban areas whereas most water is consumed in the agricultural sector. It is estimated that over 70 per cent of Australia's currently harvested water resources are used for irrigated agriculture and stock watering. In turn, irrigated agriculture accounts for around 25 per cent of the value of the nation's agricultural output.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.3Progress is being made on a number of fronts to reform the water industry and to minimise unsustainable natural resource use. Nonetheless there currently exists within the water industry:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">approaches to pricing that often pay little regard to differential patterns of consumption among users and involve cross-subsidies which, in turn, can disadvantage industrial and commercial users of water services;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the impact of past investment decisions that are now proving to be sub-optimal both from an economic and environmental perspective;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">major asset refurbishment needs in rural areas for which, in general, adequate financial provision has not been made. This presents governments with a number of challenging decisions in a period of fiscal restraint including whether to increase prices, reduce costs and/or reduce standards of service delivery;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">limitations on water being employed in higher value uses. At this time there are only limited opportunities to trade water entitlements which contribute to disincentives to water being employed in higher value uses; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">institutional arrangements that are in a number of instances less than optimal in that the roles and responsibilities for some bodies in the water industry have not been clearly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.4Numerous policy documents and public reports have also identified a number of issues and deficiencies involving water and the wider natural resource base that require the attention of governments. These include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">widespread natural resource degradation which has an impact on the quality and/or quantity of the nation's water resources;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">while policy and program frameworks are in place to address the natural resource management challenges that exist at present, these policies, practices and levels of private and public investment are not, however, going to halt the process of natural resource degradation, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whether it is in the Basin, the south west of Western Australia or parts of Tasmania the position has reached the stage where an intensive management effort is required on the part of all jurisdictions to arrest the process of degradation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.5In the light of all of this, it is recommended that Heads of Government in implementing a strategic framework for the water industry have regard to the following principles:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">water resource policy being seen as delivering on the agenda for ecologically sustainable development;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an integrated catchment management approach to water resource management;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">pricing that reflects all the costs of supply and service (including environmental costs) with all government subsidies or community service obligation payments made transparent;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">water being employed in higher value uses, within the social, physical and ecological constraints of catchments;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consistent approaches to pricing, property rights/entitlements, trading and environmental allocations across jurisdictions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">institutional arrangements and responsibilities that are clearly defined;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">measures to address the structural and social impact of reform; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">community involvement in the water reform process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.6The report recommends that Heads of Government adopt a strategic framework for reform that involves:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For metropolitan and town water services</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a re-structuring of pricing regimes with an emphasis on pay for service/pay for use;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where appropriate, the deployment of a range of measures during the transitional phase to facilitate whatever structural adjustment is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.7The report notes that the speed and extent of water industry reform and the adjustment process will be dependent on the availability of financial resources to facilitate structural adjustment and asset refurbishment. A preparedness on the part of the Commonwealth to address the taxation issues involved could facilitate this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.8Apart from improved environmental outcomes, the strategic framework is expected to result in a restructuring of water tariffs and reduced or eliminated cross-subsidies for metropolitan and town water services with the impact on domestic consumers of water services being offset by cost reductions and more efficient, customer-driven, service provision. Financial assistance for particular consumers may be necessary where cost reductions are not available to offset price increases. In the case of rural water services the framework is intended to generate the financial resources to maintain supply systems should users desire this, allow water to flow to higher value uses subject to certain social, physical and environmental constraints, provide irrigators with a tradeable asset (which could also serve as a useful structural adjustment instrument in some cases) and devolve, where appropriate, operational responsibility for irrigation schemes to local areas. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.9While the need for reform is recognised, the legacy of past investment and policy decisions, particularly in relation to irrigation schemes, means that there are very real constraints on the extent and pace of reform in some areas. Because the changes flowing from the framework are extensive and far-reaching in their implications, particularly in rural areas, it is considered that a five to eight year implementation period will be required. Some aspects of the reform packages outlined in the report will require governments to consult widely with the community more generally and private interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">E.10It is recommended that further reports be prepared for the Council of Australian Governments annually on progress in implementing the framework over the next five years, with a final report on progress to be prepared for the Council's first meeting in 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.1At its meeting on 8-9 June 1993 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) received a report from officials on the current state of play in both urban and rural water use. The report noted that, while progress had been made in reforming pricing, allocation and other aspects of the industry, there were still significant economic and environmental benefits to be derived from further reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.2In the light of this the Council asked that a Working Group of officials, under an independent chair, prepare a report for its next meeting containing a strategic framework for the efficient and sustainable reform of the water industry, having regard to the technical and policy diversity that currently exists across the States and Territories. The report is also to address the future roles of the Council of Australian Governments and Ministerial Councils in the reform process, other mechanisms and contain a proposed timetable for implementation. Jurisdictions subsequently agreed to the appointment of Sir Eric Neal AC CVO to the position of independent chair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.3This report seeks to place before Heads of Government a brief assessment of the nation's current management of its water resources and the impact of water use on the wider natural resource base. It also outlines the economic, financial and environmental challenges that the nation's exploitation of the resource at present poses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.4A strategic framework for the future management of water is set out, having regard to the policy and technical diversity currently existing among States and Territories. In developing the strategic framework the Working Group has considered the time required to implement the framework. It considers that much of what is proposed can be achieved by the year 2001, although recognising that some elements will require more time to be implemented in full.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CURRENT STATE OF PLAY</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Brief Overview</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.1Currently the Australian water industry has over $90 billion invested in it in replacement cost terms. The bulk of this investment, some $50 billion, is in urban areas whereas most water is consumed in the agricultural sector. It is estimated that around 70 per cent of Australia's currently harvested water resources are used for irrigated agriculture. In turn, irrigated agriculture accounts for around 25 per cent of the nation's agricultural output.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.2Since the June 1993 report to COAG on water resource policy, further reform has been pursued by jurisdictions and other bodies responsible for the management of the nation's water resources and/or the delivery of water and wastewater services. This, in part, builds on work generated by the development of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, the Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management and Irrigation Management Strategies and initiatives taken under the National Landcare Program. Major reform has also been driven by the wider micro-economic reform agenda and the pursuit of increased efficiency within government business enterprises and authorities.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pricing and Asset Provision and Management</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.3All jurisdictions, except the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, at least in part, use property valuations as a basis for water and wastewater charges in urban areas. Some jurisdictions provide a free allocation. In addition, there are often significant cross-subsidies from commercial and industrial customers to domestic users. In the past, this cross-subsidy has been as high as $300 million per annum in a single jurisdiction. Moves are being made to eliminate urban cross-subsidies by phasing-out the valuation approach to charging and, in some jurisdictions, to ensure that sewerage and wastewater charges reflect the costs of provision. In some jurisdictions there are also cross-subsidies from urban to rural users and between high and low volume water users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.4All the major metropolitan suppliers of water services are currently generating real returns on their assets. In contrast, in rural areas, governments have tended not to charge prices for water sufficient to maintain irrigation systems. No State currently has in place arrangements to provide fully for asset maintenance (including headworks), and refurbishment needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.5Approaches to licensing and charging for groundwater use differ around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.6In the past, investment in dams, channels and irrigation reticulation systems has not necessarily been subject to rigorous economic appraisal. In the next 25 years most jurisdictions will need additional supplies of water to meet growing demand. In some cases, further investment in headworks may be required. However, with the development of appropriate demand management strategies the opportunity exists not only to reduce the demand for future water industry infrastructure, but also to increase the productivity of those industries using water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Water Allocations/Entitlements and Trading</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.7Control of water resources in Australia since late last century has been vested in the Crown and, therefore, entitlements to use water in rural areas have been conferred by the Crown. In some areas, these rights have been over allocated. One jurisdiction is currently determining bulk entitlements to its storages as a means of converting existing imprecise water rights to explicit tradeable entitlements. This will allow the separation of water entitlements from the ownership of land, a necessary precursor to the introduction of more widespread trading in water.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.8To date, there has been only limited trade in, and transferability of, water allocations or entitlements across Australia. In some quarters trading has been opposed even though it would allow water to be used in a manner which is more economically and ecologically sustainable. For example, local government concerns over the impact of water trading on the current pattern of regional economic activity has led to such opposition in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.9Until now, availability of water specifically for environmental needs has not generally be made. At its most recent meeting the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council agreed to the allocation of a quantity of water to enhance the Barmah-Millewa forest. Elsewhere in the Murray valley there is evidence that the highly regulated nature of the river and the overallocation of water to off-river uses has led to a deterioration in the riparian ecosystem not to mention the decline in aquatic life in the river itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.10Where jurisdictions do not currently have in place a policy of providing water for the environment they are working towards this end. That said, there is a number of stressed river systems around the country. In some areas the problem is compounded by the construction of large on-farm storages although in other areas on-farm storages can be used to relieve pressures on river systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Institutional Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.11All urban water authorities are currently in the throes of change, be it structural reform, adoption of progressively more commercial foci, having their roles more clearly defined, or a combination of these. In some jurisdictions the roles of resource owner, standard setter and regulator and service provider, however, overlap, opening up the possibility for conflicts of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.12At this time, the bulk of the assets accounted for by the rural water sector are in the hands of government entities, although at least two jurisdictions are in the process of either privatising these assets or passing them to producer-controlled entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.13Arrangements for the treatment of sewage and wastewater vary around the country. Several jurisdictions are at present considering whether existing treatment and discharge policies should continue, given their often adverse impact on estuarine and coastal environments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.14Sustainable management of stormwater is acknowledged as an increasing challenge by all jurisdictions. Local government is usually responsible for managing stormwater run-off. These challenges are likely to require new approaches to urban planning, water re-use and further investment in handling and treatment facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Water and the Wider Natural Resource Base</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.15Inappropriate water use has a major impact on other components of the natural resource base. For example, inappropriate irrigation of some lands in the Murray-Darling Basin has resulted in a rising watertable and increased salinity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.16Wide-scale land clearance and the introduction of exotic plant species have also compromised the natural resource base. For instance, due to land clearance in the south and south west of Western Australia up to 50 per cent of the region's potential freshwater resources have been lost to salinity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.17Parts of the Murray-Darling Basin have been seriously degraded through these and other inappropriate practices. Many effective initiatives have been taken but there are no short-term solutions. In fact, the problems have generated a major management task. Were the situation to go on unchecked there would be dire consequences for water quality in the lower Murray, for example, on which Adelaide and other major areas of South Australia rely for almost 90 per cent of their freshwater requirements in a dry year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.18Faced with an ever growing body of evidence of the interdependency of the different natural resource components, a number of jurisdictions has begun to restructure their administrative arrangements. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council (Natural Resources Management Strategy, August 1990) stated, inter alia, that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, there is greater understanding of the interrelationship between soil, water and vegetation. There is a realisation that it is almost impossible to isolate the management of one resource, or one part of the Basin, from others. The problems associated with natural resources management are often too complex to be tackled by any one Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.19Across Australia, approaches to the management of water storage catchment areas by agencies supplying major population centres differ. In some jurisdictions, areas are closed to the public, while in others they are open. In open areas a number of issues have to be addressed including the co-ordination of land use planning, the nutrification of the water and possible algal blooms in storages. Even in closed areas there may be a need for water treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall Assessment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.20Much of a positive nature is currently occurring in the Australian water industry. Progress is being made on a number of fronts. Nonetheless, to provide greater focus to the process and to deal with a number of issues that are cross-jurisdictional in their implications there is a need for a strategic framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE AUSTRALIAN WATER INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.1The Working Group considers that, between now and the year 2001, in implementing a strategic framework governments should be guided by, or have regard to, the following principles:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Natural Resource Base and the Environment</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Water resource policy should be seen as an integral part of the wider micro-economic reform and natural resource and environmental agendas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.2The complex interrelationships between the various components of the nation's natural resource base and the environment have already been noted. In many parts of Australia, unless action is taken, further significant losses in our natural resource base are likely. That said, the use and disposal of water can also have major implications for agriculture, industry and the economy as a whole. It then becomes a question of balancing the potentially conflicting ends to which water can be put, noting though that a number of river systems are under stress from extensive harvesting and this will need to be addressed by both government and the affected communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Integrated Catchment Management</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adoption of an integrated catchment management approach to water resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.3Land use decisions in one part of a river valley or area can have impacts on the rest of the valley, the wider catchment area and in the whole of a river basin or region. Given these linkages it is important that individual groups do not pull in opposite directions on, say, land use planning matters. If improved outcomes are to be achieved mechanisms need to be put in place by government to ensure that all the affected stake-holders are involved in catchment management. Furthermore, the importance of whole-of-catchment issues needs to be taken into account in the institutional arrangements for the water industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pricing and Investment</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreement to pricing that reflects all the costs of supply and service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.4From an economic perspective, consumers of water services should pay the full cost of their provision, including environmental costs where these can be quantified. (For the purposes of this report, for urban water services, metropolitan bulk water suppliers and all new investment, full cost is defined as operational, maintenance and administration costs, an allowance for asset refurbishment, the servicing of debt/rates of return (see following paragraph).)  In most cases, efficient pricing aimed at full-cost recovery might involve the imposition of an access or connection charge together with a usage charge. If governments choose not to charge certain consumers the full cost this might be explicitly accounted for and paid as a community service obligation. In the case of many existing rural water and irrigation schemes application of the full cost definition will need to take account of operational and maintenance costs, any river delivery costs, the refurbishment costs of supply and reticulation assets, including headworks, and the extent to which investments were intended to meet social as well as economic objectives. The degree to which full cost recovery is pursued might be determined by each jurisdiction, noting the need for consistency in pricing approaches where cross-border trading is possible (see paragraph 3.8 below), but any departure from full-cost recovery should be based on transparent subsidies or community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.5In the future there will be an increasing need for the water industry as a whole to pay its way, not only in terms of new investment but in providing for the ongoing maintenance and refurbishment of existing water infrastructure. Views differ on what an appropriate hurdle rate of return might be on new investment and refurbishment in the water industry. Based on its estimates of the real cost of capital to the water industry, the Agricultural and Resource Ministers Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) has adopted a figure of 4 per cent in preparing industry performance reviews. Each jurisdiction will need to determine the most appropriate rate having regard to its circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.6If the nation is to derive the maximum sustainable benefit from its natural resources it needs to be able to employ them in their highest value ends, consistent with any social, physical and ecological constraints that might apply. Water is no exception in this regard. It has many uses all of which have different returns attaching to them. Without appropriate charging and trading mechanisms involving transferable water allocations or entitlements, water could be used in sub-optimal ways. A preparedness on the part of jurisdictions to allow water to flow to higher uses, subject to the above constraints, would enable the nation to generate greater returns from the resource than is currently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.7In order to facilitate trading, governments will need to ensure that property rights to water are clearly defined and specified in terms of ownership, volume, reliability, environmental flows and tenure. Conversion factors will also need to be specified between different areas of surface and groundwater systems and where catchments cross jurisdictional boundaries.</PARA>

Otherwise there is the potential for outcomes that are not only sub-optimal from an economic and environmental perspective but at the same time inequitable.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clarification of institutional arrangements and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.9While some jurisdictions are moving to change the institutional arrangements surrounding their water industries and to delineate more clearly the roles and responsibilities of the various players, there is still a deal of overlap in some areas in relation to the trustee for the resource, establishing and enforcing regulatory requirements and service delivery. In a first best or ideal world it would be desirable for each of these functions to be undertaken by separate entities. The alignment of organisational structures with objectives means separated bodies can be provided with clear and non-conflicting objectives and more transparent accountability mechanisms. This would enable organisations to focus more on their `core business' and lead, particularly in the case of service deliverers, to improved customer service and greater efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.10Having established such a framework, services might be delivered in as commercial a manner as possible with responsible organisations having a strong customer focus. The extent of corporatisation and/or privatisation could be a matter for each government to decide, having regard to the circumstances it faces. The benefits of greater commercialisation, and in particular corporatisation, is that organisations are able to operate at `arms length' from direct government control. Corporations can be given a clear set of commercial objectives and left to operate much like a private sector company which, like other businesses, are subject to taxation (or taxation equivalents), the disciplines of the law and market forces. Under these circumstances organisations become more clearly accountable for their financial and operational performance and less likely to be able to sustain the inefficiencies often found in less accountable organisations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.1The framework outlined in Section 3 has a number of implications for the natural resource base and the environment.

Trading in these circumstances could, however, have a deleterious impact on the riverine environment, if dormant rights are sold and used. In the latter case, there is a need to strike a new and sustainable balance between the environment and the other uses of the water. Dormant rights should be substantially reviewed before the creation of a system of tradeable water entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.2Throughout the Murray-Darling Basin stream flow data and other relevant information is readily available and could be used to develop changed harvesting patterns. Elsewhere around the country flow data is not nearly as comprehensive. In fact, a deal of research will be required to obtain robust data on flow and water quality on a number of river systems subject to major competing demands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.3In regions where comprehensive information on water flows and environmental requirements is available, it will be possible to establish the impact of within-valley and cross-valley trading in water and other environmental interactions. In other areas, judgements will, in the first instance, have to be made as to the environmental sustainability of trading. With the opportunity to undertake more research, it should be easier to determine adequate flows from a sustainability perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.4Where new water schemes or irrigation developments are contemplated, water to meet environmental requirements should be determined in conjunction with other demands. In appropriate circumstances, environmental requirements could also be tradeable or variable within limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.5Extensive water harvesting and flood control measures have had an impact on riparian environments. In a number of areas the riparian environment has been placed under stress due to the absence nowadays of regular flooding. In the Barmah-Millewa forest this problem is being addressed by improved forest water management including an allocation of a quantity of water to flood the area periodically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.6Grazing along river banks and cultivation up to the stream edge can not only have an adverse impact on the riparian environment but can also compromise water quality, as can town wastewater and sewage disposal. Riparian zones can act as filters to runoff in some situations and an important part of water quality management will be to encourage the adoption of best land management practices throughout a catchment to reduce the sources of pollution. Landcare initiatives can play an important role in this area. Other options could include agreed grazing management plans with adjacent land holders, controlled access to the water and the establishment of reserves. On-land wastewater and sewage disposal strategies can lead to an improvement in water quality and these are currently being considered in many parts of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.7Groundwater resources are important and need to be monitored to ensure that the level of use is sustainable and that their indiscriminate use does not have deleterious effects on the wider natural resource base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.8In all cases, but particularly in urban areas, a range of measures including planning and building regulations and land management approaches could be used in the future to require sustainable use and management of storm water and waste water thereby minimising environmental damage and wastage of valuable resources. These consequences would, of course, need to be assessed in consultation with local governments when developing local planning regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.9The process of institutional and economic reform underway in the water industry, has the objective of improving the economic efficiency of water use and ensuring that the costs of water related services are funded by relevant beneficiaries. It must also ensure that the outcomes will bring environmental benefits, particularly through the formal allocation of water to environmental demands along with other uses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.10Implementing this framework is expected to lead to an improvement in water quality. Currently a National Water Quality Management Strategy (NWQMS) is being developed jointly by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and ARMCANZ. The National Environment Protection Authority (NEPA) to be established under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE) will develop national environment protection measures for ambient waters drawing on the high status guidelines of the NWQMS. Governments are required under the IGAE to prepare annual reporting on the way they attain the measures established by NEPA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Integrated Catchment Management</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.11Integrated catchment management across river systems is a valuable approach to water resource management. It enables a system-wide and coordinated approach to water resource issues to be taken often resulting in significant benefits in terms of the sustainability of water supplies to users and the ecological sustainability of river systems and the wider natural resource base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.12In some parts of the nation, integrated catchment management has not been introduced to the extent that it has elsewhere. If natural resource management is to be pursued, in an integrated manner across river systems, there is a requirement for those jurisdictions where institutional arrangements of this nature have not yet been put fully in place to consider doing so.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pricing and Investment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.13In the area of metropolitan water services the pricing regimes of most jurisdictions are currently based to a greater or lesser extent on the local government rating base. The implementation of the approach to urban pricing outlined above will require the re-basing of tariff structures to include access and volumetric components. It will also require the installation of water metering devices in cities or parts of cities, such as Brisbane and Hobart, where they do not currently exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.14In most areas domestic users are subsidised. The subsidies are significant and represent a cost impost on commercial and industrial users. Time will, however, be required to unwind the subsidies and to effect offsetting cost savings, which, based on an analysis undertaken for ARMCANZ, are available in most jurisdictions, based on current levels of service. (It is noted that the impact of these savings may, however, be reduced by increased costs occasioned by the introduction of improved levels of service.) Trade waste charges in some jurisdictions are also inappropriate having regard to the costs incurred in treating and safe disposal of the waste. These charges might be adjusted over the same period to reflect the costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.15In jurisdictions where certain classes of consumers of water are subsidised by other users it is suggested that if State, Territory or local governments wish to continue these practices the extent of the subsidies be made transparent. Overall, the proposed charging reforms are expected to lead to reduced water consumption in urban areas with beneficial spin-offs in terms of the level of future investment in additional storage capacity and reticulation systems. For example, the introduction of a per kilolitre charging structure in the Hunter Water Board region resulted in a significant reduction in water consumption thereby delaying future investment in water storage capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.16While metropolitan charging arrangements generate positive returns, the same is unable to be said about rural water prices. No jurisdiction currently has in place charging arrangements to provide fully for the ongoing maintenance of its irrigation infrastructure, including the headworks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.17In these circumstances, the Working Group recognises that it is not possible to increase prices overnight. It is, however, considered possible if it were done over a period of years and accompanied by a range of supporting measures including the achievement of water delivery cost savings and more efficient demand management practices by users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.18At present, water is not always being used in the most efficient manner and this often has untoward environmental consequences. In Western Australia the South West Irrigation Study has highlighted that economic welfare would be improved if water were diverted from grazing uses and employed more in horticultural industries and to a somewhat reduced extent in dairy farming. Were this to occur, there is also likely to be a beneficial impact on the environment as water is applied to soils with greater retentive capacities rather than in areas with high water tables and salinity problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.19Water prices which more fully reflect costs could also be expected to result in water being used more effectively in rural areas, especially when accompanied by appropriate education campaigns. There is evidence that due to the cheapness of the resource, on-farm irrigation practices lead to waste and inappropriate use. Higher prices could be expected to moderate such practices and lead to less water being used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.20As mentioned, over the next 25 years, a number of jurisdictions will have to find alternative sources of supply to meet growing urban demand. In some instances, this demand might be met by rural-urban transfers at relatively little cost in terms of infrastructure investment. In other cases, more extensive investment may be required. Whatever the situation, the prices charged for the water should recover the full cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.21There are indications in some jurisdictions that the private sector may in the future play a greater role in the provision of water services. This raises a number of issues associated with the taxation treatment of these entities, and their ability to raise funds for investment. Among these issues is the possibility that infrastructure bonds could be a future source of funding for investment in the water industry. However, the coverage of these bonds does not at present extend to water supply, sewerage, irrigation, pipeline and other water projects. It has also been suggested that the existing 10 year term for infrastructure bonds may need to be lengthened in view of the long life of many water resource projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.22In the rural sector at this time there would appear to be only limited opportunities for new irrigation schemes. Again it is considered that such investment should not proceed unless it can be demonstrated by the proponent that the proposal will generate a positive real rate of return, that it will be ecologically sustainable and that the consequences for the environment have been properly weighed. These tests are a good deal more stringent than has generally applied in the past, but the costs of past deficiencies are increasingly manifest in terms of the prices that would now need to be paid for water to maintain the schemes and the measures that are required to address the environmental consequences of some irrigation practices.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tradeable Water Entitlements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.23Consistent with the principle that water should be employed in its highest value uses within the social, physical and ecological constraints of catchments, means need to be put in place to achieve this. The concept of tradeable water rights or entitlements, given that it would operate within a market framework, is generally considered to be the best way to secure the maximum benefit from the use of the resource.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.24All jurisdictions currently allocate water rights or entitlements to groups of rural users. For trading arrangements to be instituted these rights or entitlements need to be vested, where this is not already the case, in those who are deemed to be eligible to trade. In at least one jurisdiction, however, entitlements already exist which exceed the capacity of the river systems involved to satisfy. Means will need to be found to solve this problem. One approach might be to determine the environmental needs of the river systems involved and to allocate the residual water on a pro rata basis, having regard to previous entitlements and patterns of use. Having done this, entitlements might be traded either within or across catchment areas within the social, physical and ecological constraints of the catchments concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.25Against this background, there would appear to be scope to offset the impact of rising water prices by allowing farmers to sell, in part or in whole, their water entitlements and use the proceeds to re-structure their properties or to leave the land altogether. To the extent that water use were to decline overall, the impact on the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin is likely, in the longer term, to be positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistency</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.26If resources are to be allocated efficiently and trading in water to be fair and equitable it is essential that, where cross-border trading is possible, the basis of charging, including asset valuations, and entitlement arrangements are consistent. The work that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Research Economics (ABARE) has undertaken on the impact of higher water prices on irrigated agriculture in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (see below) has highlighted a number of differences between jurisdictions in relation to asset valuation and cost recovery. It would seem that these differences are already having some influence on resource allocation and locational choices resulting in negative regional and national economic effects. All other things being equal, this would be magnified in a trading situation and has to be addressed before widespread trading in the Murray-Darling Basin, in particular, could be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Institutional Change</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.27As noted, the institutional arrangements surrounding natural resource management are not as clearly defined as they might be nor are regulatory functions always separated from service delivery in the water industry. If they have not already done so, it is suggested that jurisdictions consider developing administrative arrangements where policy responsibility and stewardship of the natural resource base are closely coordinated so that management responsibility for the resource base is not fragmented, as has often been the case in the past. Where such a framework is instituted, there will need to be links established with local government and other bodies at a local level to ensure that land use planning decisions and administration do not compromise sustainable natural resource use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.28In the water area, apart from settling and administering the natural resource policy framework, there is the need to determine and monitor adherence to water quality standards or guidelines. Jurisdictions will need to consider the most appropriate institutional structure to perform these duties although some jurisdictions already have environmental protection agencies to fulfil these roles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.29Once the natural resource policy and regulatory frameworks have been defined and established, the main requirement is that water services are delivered an efficient and commercial manner. Views differ as to what is the best model to follow and each jurisdiction will need to determine which approach is best suited to its circumstances and customer needs. New South Wales has, for example, established the Hunter Water Corporation, while both New South Wales and Victoria have engaged in significant contracting-out of service provision in the water industry and privatised components of their water service delivery chains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.30The situation is somewhat different in the rural sector. Here responsibility for the operation of irrigation schemes, where it is not already the case, could be devolved to local communities who are in the best position to determine their future service requirements. As noted earlier, for the most part, irrigation schemes have hitherto been developed and operated without proper financial provision being made from revenue, for their maintenance and refurbishment. A number has outstanding debt attaching to them. Should governments be attracted to the notion of local control, this might be facilitated by governments writing-off debt, where appropriate, and/or making some financial contribution to the costs of refurbishment on the condition that future charges not only cover all the costs of delivery but provide for future maintenance and refurbishment as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.31Provisions that have been made in the past for future refurbishment have been treated by some governments as discretionary while in other cases funds have at times been looked upon as a convenient source of revenue. The consequences of this approach has been underlined more recently in the case of the Torrumbarry Weir where there is no stock of financial resources to draw upon to undertake any re-construction work that might be approved. It is considered that the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council should consider the establishment of financial arrangements to ensure that future operating, maintenance, administration and refurbishment costs of headworks and structures under its control are collected from water users.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Structural Adjustment in Irrigated Agriculture</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.32ABARE in analysing the impact of higher water prices on agricultural production in the southern part of the Murray-Darling Basin obtained estimates from the relevant State water agencies on the per megalitre prices that would need to be charged to users to maintain the existing irrigation infrastructure, including the headworks, in this part of the Basin. ABARE found that the price rises flowing from the introduction of full cost recovery would reduce income in the regions modelled by about $66 million per year or about 6 per cent of total regional income derived from agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.33This estimation of losses, however, is likely to be overstated for a number of reasons. The model used did not allow for adjustments in water supply infrastructure, technology, drainage systems and farm capital and demand management, among other things. In the long run adjustments in these areas would be expected to enable more efficient water supply and demand and, other things being equal, result in lower water costs. Furthermore, the prices used in the model were derived using asset valuations based on current water supply systems and the maintenance of these systems in perpetuity. More appropriate asset valuation methods, for example, the adoption of the Guidelines on Accounting Policy for Current Valuation of Assets (for National Performance Monitoring of Government Trading Enterprises), could result in asset values on which full cost recovery charges were based being lower, with a subsequent lowering of water prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.34In the same study ABARE found that the introduction of tradeable water entitlements would generate gains from trade between regions in the model of around $48 million per year. However, it was also emphasised that this figure is expected to be an underestimate of the gains for two reasons. First, long-term gains (which the model does not capture) are expected to be greater and second, the model only took account of inter-regional trades, not intra-regional trade from which additional gains could be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.35In summary, ABARE has concluded that the national economic and environmental gains from the implementation of these particular reforms would be significant. While the financial impacts of the package of reforms result in gains and losses, it is important to note that the limitations of the model led ABARE to emphasise that the losses are likely to be overestimated, while the gains underestimated. Furthermore, the study only focuses on the impact of these reforms from the point of view of irrigated water users. While the reforms result in both gains and losses to this sector, from an economy-wide perspective the losses quantified above constitute a transfer from one sector of the economy to the other, not a loss to the economy as a whole. On the other hand, the gains represent a net addition to the economy which after multiplier effects would be significantly larger than the initial $48 million identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.36This said, the ABARE work and studies commissioned by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission indicate that in some areas an increase in water prices to the levels required to maintain irrigation infrastructure will put pressure on some segments of irrigated agriculture. Farm amalgamations and restructuring may be appropriate in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.37Shifts in production patterns in an environment of increased water prices and transferability of water entitlements will not be costless and are likely to bring changes to regional economies. In this context the governments may need to consider the financial implications of structural adjustment through programs like the Rural Adjustment Scheme and those carried out by the Office of Labour Market Adjustment. For example, governments may need to consider making structural adjustment assistance available on a regional basis, rather than as occurs at present, on an individual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.38It is, however, important to note in this context that water prices generally only represent a small proportion of the total farm costs. Furthermore, the modelling exercise undertaken by ABARE assumes that water prices are immediately increased to the higher levels demanded by full cost recovery. However, the reforms recommended in this report would be phased in over a longer time period. For example, if water costs represented 10 per cent of total farm costs and prices increased by 10 per cent per annum, total farm costs would, all other things being equal, only rise by 1 per cent per annum. Thus, the proposed phasing mechanism would be expected to reduce significantly the impact of structural adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.39Structural adjustment in an environment of tradeable water entitlements also raises a number of potential taxation issues including the capital gains tax treatment of the proceeds from the sale of water entitlements. The Working Group noted the potential significance of tax related issues but in the time available was not able to address these matters in any detail. It is proposed that a sub-committee of Commonwealth and State officials established by the Working Group on Micro-economic Reform meet to discuss taxation issues of relevance to the water industry with a view to reporting, through the Working Group, to COAG within 12 months. It is also expected that the proposed Industry Commission Inquiry into Private Sector Infrastructure Funding will examine and report on, inter alia, the implications for private sector funding, management and control of government, institutional, taxation and regulatory arrangements. Relevant water related taxation issues could be examined in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.40It is also noted that the Premier of New South Wales has written to the Prime Minister indicating that the corporatisation/privatisation of irrigation schemes may raise issues of tax compensation. The Prime Minister's response indicated that future consideration of tax compensation payments should be dealt with through the Commonwealth/State Working Group established at the July 1993 financial Premiers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community Involvement and Public Education</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.41There is a growing recognition around the country that water and water services are not free goods. There are numerous examples of public education initiatives and the seeking of community input into finding solutions to shared challenges, be they meeting future supply needs, improving water quality or reducing pollution from waste water and storm water discharges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.42A number of these issues is local in their implications and arrangements might be put in place in the local community to address them. For example, cooperation in community monitoring through national programs such as "Waterwatch", and the establishment of a local catchment body or a landcare group where these do not already exist. In other areas, jurisdictions could co-operate in the production of material for public education campaigns as New South Wales and Queensland have done in the "Waterwise" campaign. Some jurisdictions are targeting schoolchildren in their education campaigns. Jurisdictions already involved in these activities could share their experience with those who are not and to work with the relevant education authorities to develop appropriate curricula and resource materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.43In the rural sector there is an increasing recognition that some past and present practices place at risk the future of a great deal of agricultural activity and the wider environment. Generally, farmers, once faced with the longer term consequences of these practices, have been prepared to effect changes, for example, in some instances even buying out fellow farmers to ensure that agriculture in salinity-prone areas continues to be sustainable. Further evidence of community preparedness to become actively involved is the establishment of over 1600 Landcare groups, "Streamwatch" groups and, in South Australia, the proposed establishment of community self management groups to look after local water systems. It is considered vital in implementing the other aspects of the strategic framework outlined in this report that governments and other bodies such as the Murray-Darling Basin Commission continue to tap the current willingness and preparedness within the community to find shared solutions to common problems and challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.44It is also important that programs be put in place for the on-going exchange of information with the general public and interest groups on the cause and effect relationships between infrastructure performance, standards of service and related costs. The derivation of sustainable standards of service will be achieved in a far more effective manner, if longer term implications are recognised by all parties during the establishment process. Failure to take the necessary steps is likely to result in the initial formalisation of unsustainable service standards, with significant adverse cost implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.45The results of water research should feed into public consultation and education processes. While a good deal of water and water-related research is currently being undertaken there is a need to ensure that this research buttresses the strategic framework canvassed in this report. Greater co-ordination and liaison between research agencies to utilise more effectively the expertise of bodies such as the Land and Water Research and Development Corporation, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and other Commonwealth and State organisations would be beneficial in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IMPLEMENTATION AND TIMING</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.1A number of the changes that have been canvassed in this report are already in train in some jurisdictions. Other changes outlined are more far-reaching in their implications and so are incapable of being introduced overnight. In some instances, there is a deal of conceptual analysis yet to be done. In other cases, time will be needed for consultation and adjustment to occur. This is certainly the position where pricing matters are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.2The speed and extent of water industry reform and the adjustment process will also be dependent on the availability of financial resources to facilitate structural adjustment and asset refurbishment. A preparedness on the part of the Commonwealth to address the taxation issues involved could facilitate this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.3The widespread need to re-base pricing arrangements, and at the same time remove cross-subsidies for particular classes of urban consumers of water services, will require a period of adjustment. This notwithstanding, the Working Group considers it to be achievable by the end of 1998. The first step in the process is, however, for agreement to be reached on cost recovery definitions. It is suggested that an expert group, on which all jurisdictions might be represented, be requested to do this and report to COAG at its first meeting in 1995. Moreover, where a State, Territory or local government authority decides that a particular class of consumer should not bear the full cost of services provided, this cost, at the earliest time, should not only be fully disclosed but, where possible, the service deliverer be reimbursed for any shortfall in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.4As far as rural water pricing is concerned, it is considered that more time will be required to effect changes. It is therefore suggested that jurisdictions work towards achieving full cost recovery (as defined in Section 3.4) no later than 2001. As with urban water pricing, there will be a need, particularly among jurisdictions involved in the Murray-Darling Basin, to agree on cost-recovery definitions as well as a common approach to asset valuation. The expert group mentioned in paragraph 5.3 might undertake this work and report to COAG at its first meeting in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.5Attention will also need to be given to settling an approach to meeting the costs of water required to be stored for subsequent release for environmental and recreational purposes. In the case of water stored for environmental purposes one approach could be to treat such costs as part of the production costs of total water supply of that particular system and spread the costs across all relevant water consumers. Similarly, in the case of water stored and subsequently released simply to maintain flows for recreational and/or tourist activities a charge against the community as a whole might be appropriate. It is suggested that ARMCANZ, with the assistance of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, work towards determining, for inclusion in the first annual report to COAG, the charging principles to cover the financial implications of environmental allocations and recreational uses of water bodies and courses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.6In addition, ARMCANZ by early 1995 might also consider the licensing/charging arrangements surrounding groundwater use given the importance of this resource and the adverse impact its indiscriminate use can have on the wider natural resource base. Advice could then be provided to individual jurisdictions to be used by them in their development of appropriate groundwater arrangements with the details of this advice to be contained in the report to COAG at the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.7In relation to establishing formal systems of water allocations or entitlements, jurisdictions where they have not already done so, should begin to do so as soon as possible with a view to having arrangements in place to allow more widespread trading in water to commence no later than 1998. For the Murray-Darling Basin jurisdictions, where it is essential that consistent entitlement systems be put in place to facilitate cross-Basin trading, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, in conjunction with ARMCANZ, should settle the form of the arrangements by the end of 1994. The arrangements should address such matters as ownership, environmental allocations, water quality, volume and tenure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.8The States would also need to submit guidelines for water trading to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to ensure sustainability and compliance with the Murray-Darling Agreement.  This said, it is considered that there should be no impediment to private sector brokers participating in the trading process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.9Where it is found that more water should be made available for the environment or that river systems have been overallocated, it is a matter for individual jurisdictions, in the first instance, to decide how these challenges might be overcome. For example, overallocation of water could be addressed by determining the environmental needs of the (river, groundwater) system involved and then allocating the residual water on a pro-rata basis, having regard to previous entitlements and usage. Having done this, entitlements might then be traded. In the event that there are cross-border implications, as in the case of the Murray-Darling Basin, jurisdictions should, however, co-operate in finding solutions. In the case of the Basin, it is considered that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and Ministerial Council should be involved in this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.10The pricing reforms for rural water users, together with the introduction of formal entitlement and trading arrangements, will require consultation with those affected. It is suggested that this occur at an early time to enable governments to gauge what, if any, structural adjustment assistance will be required to bring about the resource allocation and production changes that are expected to flow from the initiatives proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.11It is a matter for individual jurisdictions to progress institutional change, particularly that involving local government in integrated catchment management. Nevertheless, it is considered that jurisdictions should have as a goal to effect the institutional change discussed elsewhere in this report as soon as practicable, and preferably no later than 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.12As noted in Section 4 of the report, there is scope for the costs of delivering water services to be reduced. Indeed, such cost reductions would assist in cushioning, for example, the impact of removing cross-subsidies in urban areas. It is therefore suggested that ARMCANZ, in conjunction with the Steering Committee on National Performance Monitoring of Government Trading Enterprises, further develop by June 1995 its inter-agency comparisons of performance as a spur to improved efficiency in service delivery in the water industry. It is further suggested, in this context, that service providers be required to achieve international best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.13Where public education is concerned, it is suggested that the initiatives that have been taken individually and jointly by jurisdictions be built upon. These could include programs on water use and the benefits to be derived from reform. In addition, water and education authorities might further collaborate in developing resource materials on water resources for use in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.14At various points in this report mention has been made of wastewater use and strategies for handling stormwater. There is a number of ramifications attaching to this. It is therefore suggested that ARMCANZ, ANZECC and the Ministerial Council for Planning, Housing and Local Government examine the possibilities for making greater use of these sources of water with a view to reporting progress to COAG at its first meeting in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.15As observed at the outset of this section of the report, the proposed reforms are extensive and far-reaching in their implications. It is considered that in view of the whole-of-government nature of the matters traversed COAG should monitor closely progress in implementing the framework and sanctioning changes where these are thought necessary. To this end, it is suggested that the Working Group on Water Resource Policy coordinate the preparation of a report to the Council for its first meeting in 1995. In the succeeding four years ARMCANZ, ANZECC and, where appropriate, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council and the Ministerial Council for Planning, Housing and Local Government might report annually on progress with a final report being prepared for the Council's consideration at its first meeting in 2001.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL LANDCARE PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 a major review of Primary Industries and Energy portfolio natural resource management programs was completed. These programs, which included the former Federal Water Resources Assistance Program (FWRAP) and the National Soil Conservation Program (NSCP), were assessed to ensure that they reflected current objectives in natural resource management and to facilitate desirable program outcomes. The review was undertaken against a background of the evolution of the Commonwealth ecologically sustainable development process and an increased emphasis on the whole systems approach pursued through integrated catchment management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review recommended increased emphasis on facilitation and catalytic projects rather than capital works projects. It also recommended a more explicit focus on ecologically sustainable development objectives and improved resource management and efficiency. It further recommended that funding for the land and water programs should form part of a comprehensive policy which draws on Commonwealth, State and individual responsibilities and resources to address natural resource management problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the Government's endorsement of the review's broad findings, the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance ) Act 1992  was enacted, repealing the former water and soil conservation program Acts resulting in the establishment of the National Landcare Program (NLP).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development is a major basis for the NLP. The Program requires complementary institutional reforms and economic measures to be implemented in concert with Commonwealth funded activities, in accordance with terms outlined in Commonwealth-State partnership agreements currently under negotiation with State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the NLP the Commonwealth is pursuing a range of objectives to achieve sustainable resource management and use. Under the partnership arrangements, the States will be required to incorporate a broad package of measures designed to achieve sustainable resource use and viable industries. Under both the NLP and the Murray-Darling Basin Initiative, an integrated package of land, water and related vegetation measures are being advanced to achieve the Commonwealth's objectives for efficient and sustainable resource use. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission released its Algal Management Strategy for the Basin in October 1994. Other key elements include: education; training; resource, property and catchment planning; the self-help Landcare movement; and infrastructure development, together with economic, policy and institutional reform. Linkages between rural development and resource management programs are being improved with the objective of fostering self-reliant, competitive and sustainable rural industries and regions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The long term aim of the NLP is to foster sustainable resource use through integrated approaches to resource management. Community landcare, integrated catchment planning and improved land use management as well as water supply and management activities can all contribute to achieving the sustainable resource management goal. Natural resource problems are complex, often requiring approaches that are region or catchment specific. While resource allocation and pricing are important, other issues must also be addressed. This broad based approach provides for comprehensive scope and strategic focus while successfully providing for leverage to be applied to achieve complementary reforms which are beyond the reach of Commonwealth expenditure programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NLP recognises the need to integrate more closely approaches to land, water and vegetation issues and to achieve better coordination between levels of government and with the community in order to progress the Government's ESD and micro-economic reform agendas. By providing a basis for sustainable natural resource use, the NLP underpins the Government's strategies for maximising the contribution of rural industries and regions to the economic and social well-being of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of the NLP is to enhance the efficient, sustainable and equitable management of the nation's natural resources for the benefit of the overall community by:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new program has three components:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a Community Landcare Component encompassing policies and relevant funding for community landcare action which acknowledges the community as a key stakeholder and critical in the development of a landcare ethos</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a Commonwealth/State component encompassing policies and programs which the Commonwealth and States may undertake together; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a National component encompassing those activities which the Commonwealth may undertake in its own right such as research and development</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State and local governments and community organisations are intimately involved in delivery of the National Landcare Program, both through the community landcare component and Commonwealth-State partnership component. In the case of community landcare, State agencies act as agents for the Commonwealth. Community landcare in particular is considered to be a critical element in galvanising broad awareness and support for institutional and policy reform in resource manage ment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Programs from other Commonwealth agencies supporting community based resource and environmental management activities are also part of the NLP, in particular, the Save the Bush, One Billion Trees and River Murray Corridor of Green programs administered by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the community component of the Natural Resources Management Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin administered by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work has also commenced on the implementation papers (Policies and Process for Water Quality Management) of the National Water Quality Management Strategy which will give a sharper focus to the policies and principles underlying the Strategy and allow the community to understand the whole package and how community stakeholders can best contribute to enhancing water quality and its management through, for example, participation in the development of Water and Land Management Plans and catchment management approaches.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry commenced hearings on 4 February 1994 and concluded on 7 June 1994. The Committee comprised six Senators with Senator Gerry Jones as the Chairman. The Committee received 122 written submissions from individuals, including submissions from current and former Service personnel, and 16 submissions from various organisations. Evidence was heard from 57 witnesses at the public hearings, in some cases more than once. Four witnesses appeared in-camera before the Committee. The Report contains 42 Recommendations with topics ranging from re-defining policy documents and refining training and education programs, through to the severity of the censures handed down to personnel from HMAS Swan.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONTEXT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Terms of Reference for the Committee arose out of allegations of incidents of sexual harassment that occurred in HMAS Swan during a tour of duty in South-East Asia during 1992. The most serious allegation was that of sexual assault of the female medical officer by a fellow officer. At a subsequent court martial the accused officer was acquitted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee firmly endorsed the principle of equal opportunity for women in the Australian Defence Force. The Report emphasised that, in order to achieve integration, personnel at all levels must be educated on gender-related issues. Further, Defence Force managers must have and use effective tools to manage these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While dealing with and reporting first on the incidents in HMAS Swan, the Committee inquired into the nature and extent of sexual harassment throughout the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was complimentary of the initiatives taken by the Navy after the incidents in  HMAS Swan to further the integration of women and eliminate sexual harassment. However, the Committee felt that the Army and Air Force, while having plans in train, were not proceeding with the same degree of urgency and commitment evident in the Navy. Army and Air Force are affording a high priority to this issue and have developed the appropriate mechanisms and put educational programs in place. It is important that the three Services and the Australian Defence Force Academy maintain this momentum. The continuing commitment by the leaders of the Australian Defence Force is imperative if the Defence Force is to meet the challenges of integration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUMMARY OF THE REPORT FROM THE SENATE INQUIRY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This overview provides comments on the main themes emerging from each of the chapters of the Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 1&mdash;Sexual Harassment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter provides a general overview of sexual harassment not only in the Australian Defence Force, but in the community as a whole. The Committee noted that under the revised definition in the Sex Discrimination Act: `it is now no longer necessary for the complainant to demonstrate disadvantage as a result of sexual harassment. The crux of the difficulty with this definition lies in the very subjective nature of the criterion itself.'  The definition of sexual harassment is not clear and organisations' and individuals' perceptions may differ markedly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 2&mdash;Sexual Harassment in the Navy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter builds on the comments in chapter 1 but specifically addresses the incidence and nature of sexual harassment or sexual assault in the Navy. The Committee believes that adequate statistics were not available as many members were reluctant to complain for fear of retribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 3&mdash;Accommodation in HMAS Swan</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter acknowledges that accommodation in HMAS Swan, which carries a crew of 250, is cramped in both the working and living conditions. Modifications to the accommodation in existing vessels can be expensive and must be balanced against other factors such as their remaining time in service.  This class of ship has undergone some modifications but, as they will be phased out of service at the turn of the century, extensive modifications are not economically viable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 4&mdash;Behaviour of Officers Ashore</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 4 examines the behaviour of officers from HMAS Swan during the deployment in South East-Asia, and concludes that the crew was generally well behaved, although some examples of immature behaviour were displayed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 5&mdash;The Terms of Reference of the Board of Inquiry</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Board of Inquiry was established primarily to investigate allegations of sexual harassment against a female Reserve medical officer, Dr Carole Wheat, by fellow officers. This chapter looks at whether the Terms of Reference of the Board of Inquiry were sufficient to enable it to consider any aspects of unacceptable behaviour that occurred on board HMAS Swan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 6&mdash;Recommendations of the Board of Inquiry</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter addresses the many recommendations made by the Board of Inquiry including: the censuring of the four individuals in Swan; gender issues; sexual harassment of junior sailors; management styles; and Defence Instructions on the management of sexual harassment in the Australian Defence Force. Eleven of the 42 Recommendations are covered in this chapter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 7&mdash;Disciplinary and Administrative Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter closely analyses the mechanisms within the Australian Defence Force for maintaining good order and discipline. It questions whether the administrative action taken against individuals named in the Board of Inquiry was appropriate and relates this action to the Recommendations of the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 8&mdash;The Court Martial</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter deals with the appropriateness of the decisions made as part of determining whether sexual assault charges should be laid, and a court martial convened, in reference to an officer serving in HMAS Swan in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 9&mdash;Integration of Women in the Navy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As women moved into more non-traditional areas of employment, each of the Services was able to determine how and at what speed to proceed with the integration of women within its ranks. Chapter 9 examines the content and the timing of directives from the Government in relation to the integration of women into the Navy, with particular reference to sea going appointments, and the actions taken by the Government relating to the Board of Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 10&mdash;The Navy's Response to Sexual Harassment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter addresses the appropriateness of actions taken by the Navy subsequent to the establishment of the Board of Inquiry, to address the issue of sexual harassment on Navy ships. It considers in detail the range of initiatives set in place to manage sexual harassment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 11&mdash;The Good Working Relationships Project</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The long-term aim of this program is to bring about cultural change within the Navy. Because the focus of this program is on interpersonal relationships in the workplace, the effects of the Good Working Relationships project will be more evident in five to ten years time. This chapter addresses the Term of Reference which requires the Committee to evaluate the Good Working Relationships project being undertaken by the Navy. Nine of the 42 Recommendations are found in this chapter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chapter 12&mdash;Sexual Harassment in the Australian Defence Force</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Terms of Reference required it to examine the nature and extent of sexual harassment in the Army and Air Force. This chapter addresses many issues ranging from the culture of the Australian Defence Force, Defence policy and responsibilities of senior managers, through to community attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STRUCTURE OF THE RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Inquiry's Terms of Reference focused primarily on sexual harassment in the Navy, however, the incidents in HMAS Swan have served as a catalyst to focus the Australian Defence Force's attention and efforts to address gender issues and sexual harassment in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each Service is responsible for implementing the policies and initiatives that apply to the Australian Defence Force as a whole and in accordance with its operational requirements. Consequently, the Response explains the different approaches taken by each Service and the Australian Defence Force Academy to the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Response follows in sequence the 42 Recommendations. Some of these have multiple parts, hence there are 66 separate components.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, of the 66 components of the Recommendations, 53 are supported, four are supported in principle, five are supported in part, two are not supported, and two are under examination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Recommendations that are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">supported in principle are&mdash;11, 16, 39Vb, 39VIa;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">supported in part are&mdash;3, 9, 10, 14 and 39IIIa;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">not supported are&mdash;1, 2; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">under examination are&mdash;27 and 39Va.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSES TO RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the definition of sexual harassment under the Sex Discrimination Act be redefined to reflect more clearly</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the hierarchy of complaints;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the advantage, where possible, of the complainant informing the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour is offensive;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the appropriate mechanisms and legal sanctions for the different degrees of seriousness of the unlawful behaviour</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not consider that amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act are necessary or appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1 (point 1 and point 3)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the bases for this recommendation are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Committee's concern that the broad nature of the definition creates uncertainty, in so far as it could encompass an extremely wide range of behaviour; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Committee's concern that the subjective element of the test is relied upon too heavily in the determination of a complaint (paragraphs 1.28 and 1.33).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current definition of sexual harassment was drafted to reflect Government policy which is that, in determining whether sexual harassment has occurred, there is a need to consider the complainant's perception of what has occurred, balanced against a test of what a reasonable person in all the circumstances would have anticipated (Explanatory memorandum to the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992). This test provides the flexibility which is necessary to accommodate the wide range of behaviours capable of constituting sexual harassment. It also permits the assessment of individual cases on their merits, taking into account all surrounding circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government policy is that the complainant's perception (the subjective element of the test) is relevant to determining whether sexual harassment has occurred. Whether a person feels sexually harassed will depend on circumstances particular to that individual (for example, age, sex, race, culture and relationship to the alleged harasser). This is reflected in the words "in all the circumstances". To ignore the complainant's perception of the conduct in question fails to acknowledge the often devastating effect on a complainant of sexual harassment and the differential effect of particular conduct on different complainants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal to establish a hierarchy of complaints (Recommendation 1&mdash;point 1) with a corresponding delineation of the appropriate mechanisms and legal sanctions for the different degrees of seriousness of the unlawful behaviour (Recommendation 1&mdash;point 3) is at odds with current Government policy. The legislation does not currently differentiate between types of harassment because all such behaviour is based on disrespect and abuse of power. The Government has indicated that it will not tolerate sexual harassment in any form. Sexual harassment is a generic term which is capable of encompassing a wide range of behaviour. It would therefore be virtually impossible to list every type of behaviour which is capable of constituting sexual harassment. Construction of such a list would be a necessary precondition to insertion of a hierarchy of complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of a hierarchy of complaints would also not take account of the differential effects on a complainant of particular behaviour. In effect, a hierarchy would operate to devalue the effects on a complainant of particular behaviour and send a message to the community that some forms of sexual harassment are of a lesser concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To draw a line between certain types of harassment and allocate specific sanctions to each would undermine the system of conciliation and the flexibility of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to provide a remedy that is appropriate in the circumstances. The emphasis of all the human rights legislation administered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is on conciliation and providing a remedy appropriate to the circumstances in question. To prescribe particular penalties for particular types of behaviour is contrary to this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government therefore believes that it is unnecessary to amend the Sex Discrimination Act as recommended by the Senate Committee in points 1 and 3.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1 (point 2)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation does not take adequate account of the power differentials between the person harassed and the harasser and the effects of sexual harassment. The Recommendation appears to be based, to a certain extent, on the Committee's view that a person who is harassed should have an obligation to confront the harasser.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many reasons why a person who alleges sexual harassment is unwilling or unable to confront the alleged harasser; these include the effects the alleged harassment has had on the complainant and the power relationship between the parties. According to Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the majority of persons bringing sexual harassment complaints before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are young women who feel unable to speak to the harasser. Women who do wish to confront the alleged harasser and have a complaint dealt with informally should be encouraged to do so, however, this is a very different proposition to the one being put forward by the Committee. The Committee's proposal has the potential to create a situation in which a complainant is required to inform the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour is offensive or to justify that the circumstances were such that it was not possible to do so, before proceeding to an outside body. The proposal may create a strong disincentive to the making of complaints and has the potential to create further legal and administrative hurdles for the complainant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission should investigate the proposal that the requirement under the Sex Discrimination Act for employers to take all `reasonable steps' to prevent an employee or agent from engaging in unlawful acts of sexual harassment should specify that, as one such `reasonable step', the employer should provide support, through an appropriate off-line, internal unit in the organisation (such as Sexual Harassment Contact officers) or, facilitate access to an external agency (such as the Sex Discrimination Commissioner), for the person who feels harassed to bring to the attention of an alleged harasser (directly or indirectly) that the person's behaviour is offensive, intimidating or humiliating.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such action should be seen as different from a formal complaint alleging sexual harassment and provide an opportunity for both parties to clarify the situation and be made aware of the possible consequences if offensive behaviour continues. The purpose of the measure is to assist in resolving genuine misunderstandings before they become a major difficulty in the work relationship, particularly in situations where the person who feels harassed feels unable to prevent the offending behaviour by his or her own action alone. The measure would also simplify the resolution of a subsequent complaint, should such a complaint be formally lodged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that it would be inappropriate to put such a requirement in legislation. Such detail is dealt with more appropriately in policies developed by individual employers to suit their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's training package for managers and supervisors on eliminating sexual harassment from the workplace encourages and points out the advantages of developing an `in house' process for dealing with sexual harassment complaints so that they can be dealt with expeditiously and less formally. The package notes the need to ensure that `in house' sexual harassment policies should always include mechanisms for informing a person alleging sexual harassment of all the options so that people can make an informed choice about how to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, it is not clear from the Recommendation whether recourse to `in house' facilities would be a precondition to the lodging of a formal complaint with an outside body. All complainants should have the option of choosing to deal with a situation of alleged harassment in a manner which is comfortable to them. They should continue to have the option to proceed directly to an outside agency or attempt to resolve the situation in accordance with internal policies and procedures for dealing with sexual harassment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force already provides assistance through many avenues, outside the formal complaint processes, and these include toll-free telephone numbers, Sexual Harassment Contact Officers, Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinators, Student Counsellors and access to mediators through a conflict resolution process which may include the involvement of external consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Navy pay greater attention to the in-port activities of its personnel to gain the maximum benefit from these visits while minimising the potential for unacceptable behaviour. The Committee recommends that ships' officers, in conjunction with the Australian Defence or diplomatic representatives in the countries to be visited, identify possible suitable cultural, sporting and social in-port activities and make the arrangements for interested crew members to participate. This function could best be undertaken by officers, such as doctors and chaplains, who are responsible for the health and well-being of the crew.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in Part</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the principle of maximising the benefit of Navy ship visits to other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian diplomatic representatives are consulted routinely about the program and activities for individual Navy ship visits to their countries of accreditation. The arrangements take account of host country culture and of the recreational facilities and opportunities available to the ship's company. Program activities typically involve a range of sporting fixtures and access to local recreational facilities. Particularly, in developing countries, members of the ships' companies frequently undertake valued civic action projects such as maintenance work or improvements in schools and health clinics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations of the Senate Inquiry have been conveyed to relevant overseas posts requesting that they take particular account of this Recommendation in the future planning of Navy ship visits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visiting ship through the designated Visits Officer, appointed by the Commanding Officer, establishes early and continuous liaison with the local Naval Agent or Australian representative in preparing the program for the visit. This formal program of `suitable cultural, sporting and social' activities is arranged consistent with the length of the port visit. Organised activities for a particular port are promulgated to the ship's company well in advance of the date of arrival to facilitate selection of sporting teams, arrangement of tours and registration of interest in other activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commanding Officers are responsible for the health and well-being of their subordinates. Visits Officers may be appointed from any branch including medical, dental or chaplains. However, medical officers are not well placed to undertake this task because port visits usually involve increased demands on a medical officer treating patients of ships in convoy or making arrangements for specialist reviews and tests with local medical facilities that are unavailable in a ship at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navy stresses the importance of arranging appropriate in-port activities at Commanding Officer and Executive Officer designate courses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Army and Air Force will continue to liaise with Australian military, civilian as well as local community representatives for recreational, cultural and welfare purposes, both within Australia and whilst deployed overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that care be taken to ensure that the choice of legal counsel appointed by Navy, Army and Air Force to assist with multiple inquiries or legal proceedings into the same or related matters does not give rise to perceptions of possible conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Instruction relating to inquiries into `Matters Affecting the Defence Force' will be amended to give guidance on the appointment of counsel to assist Boards of Inquiry. The guiding principle is that counsel will not be appointed to appear in Military Courts or to assist Boards of Inquiry or other tribunals if the involvement of counsel will reasonably give the perception to any interested party that the appointment could cause a conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Defence Instructions covering Inquiries into Matters Affecting the Defence Force be amended to include a requirement, in the case of an inquiry into personnel matters such as sexual harassment, to inform all witnesses, including those who are not directly the subject of recommendations, of their status at the conclusion of the inquiry. Consideration should also be given to advising all those directly involved in an inquiry of the outcome of any action taken pursuant to the inquiry as soon as possible after decisions on the implementation of the inquiry's recommendations have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Force considers it appropriate, in the case of an inquiry into personnel matters, to inform all witnesses of their status and the outcome of the inquiry in relation to matters relevant to them. It is intended that the Appointing Authority for the inquiry will provide witnesses with this information as soon as possible after decisions on the findings of the inquiry have been made. The relevant Defence Instruction will be amended to provide necessary guidance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that supervisors be clearly instructed and required to record in writing whether a performance assessment of an individual is based on a short period providing limited opportunities for observation of the performance of that individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Performance appraisal is an integral part of the Australian Defence Force's personnel management policy. Performance appraisal is based on principles of honesty and integrity and provides the primary tool by which personnel are selected for promotion and career progression. They also provide feedback to individuals about their performance. By definition any performance appraisal requires a subjective assessment to be made about the performance and ability of subordinates. However, each Service has clear and comprehensive guidelines setting out the methodology and the responsibility in raising a performance appraisal report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Australian Defence Force officers and enlisted members are observed for a minimum period before a performance appraisal report may be rendered. This observation period varies from three to six months depending on the Service involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that a special effort be made to ensure that all qualified entry personnel be given sufficient information to understand the regulations governing public employment in the Defence Force and Navy's way of applying those regulations to its organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Present Navy policy is that qualified entry officers will not be posted to sea until they have completed the full new entry program. Qualified entry officers receive advice from Navy Office as well as individual career counselling during their initial training course. This advice is under review to ensure that the regulations governing public employment in the Defence Force, and the Navy's way of applying those regulations to its organisation, is comprehensively covered. Additionally, the contents of literature for prospective applicants covering such issues, as conditions of service, career paths and possible sea postings, is under review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Army employs direct entry officers in their specialised roles. Prior to appointment, each candidate is advised, in detail, of conditions of service, likely employment prospects and a possible career path. Any additional tasks required of these officers are included in their initial training or imparted during attendance, by selected direct entry officers, at subsequent generalist or specialist courses. Army will include aspects of employment and the laws governing employment in the curriculum for the direct entry officer course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Force qualified entry officers are comprehensively apprised of the conditions of employment in the Service during the recruiting and induction process. All qualified entry officers undertake courses that provide them with knowledge of the conditions applicable to their Air Force service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that Navy continue, through the Good Working Relationships program, to examine and improve all aspects of work relationships within and between the various functional groups in the Navy. In particular the Committee recommends that further detailed studies be carried out, with the assistance of expert consultants, into the impact of group dynamics on the individuals in the Navy, and on the organisation more generally, with a view to harnessing more effectively the human resources available to achieve higher standards of performance and behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of service life places strong emphasis on individuals contributing positively to the team of which they are a member. This will be affected by the interaction between individuals and the dynamics of the group as a whole. The Australian Defence Force takes the view that all its personnel need to be aware of how these aspects affect themselves and their colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navy is conducting a study into the impact of group dynamics on individuals and on the organisation. Separately, the review of the Divisional System will in part address these issues. Both Army and Air Force are examining the need for similar studies within their respective Services, and if appropriate, the Services will implement the recommendations as soon as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the teamwork requirements of most Army employment, the potential social adjustment, such as working in mixed gender groups, of all applicants is checked by the interviewing psychologist prior to entry. Army is particularly concerned with teamwork and seeks every opportunity to enhance it. Army is expanding its entry training in group processes, and post enlistment and undergraduate training opportunities in behavioural sciences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Air Force Equal Employment Opportunity strategy is a similar program to Good Working Relationships, known as `One Team'. `One Team' aims to achieve their goal of sustaining a total force of Service, civilian and contracting personnel working as one professional team.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the Australian Defence Force Academy's Leadership Training Program, group dynamic processes are addressed throughout the three years of the course. The program includes learning exercises on the themes of teamwork, power, influence and appropriate leadership behaviour, and the psychology of individual and organisational behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This training is closely related to instruction provided in the Military Professionalism and Ethics, Interpersonal Relationships and Character Development Programs. These programs establish the standards of personal behaviour required by individuals in the Australian Defence Force and the responsibilities of leaders to ensure those standards are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that in all its training and education courses on gender awareness, Navy stresses the responsibility of all individuals involved in incidents of unacceptable behaviour and sexual harassment. While it may not always be possible for the person who feels offended to tell the offender directly, the person who objects to the behaviour has a responsibility, especially if the offensive behaviour could also be interpreted as jocular or light-hearted, to tell at least one other person about it, preferably someone well placed to support the person who feels offended to resolve the situation before it deteriorates further. To facilitate such communication the identity of all Sexual Harassment Contact officers as the personnel best equipped to offer support should be readily accessible to all personnel; moreover all personnel should be clearly advised that they may approach the Sexual Harassment Contact officer in their own unit or in any other unit or division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in Part</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force strongly emphasises that the preferred method of resolution is for the person offended by the behaviour of another to bring it to the early attention of the offender, wherever possible, or to the attention of a third party. Conflict resolution strategies, the identity of Harassment Contact officers and the availability of the 008 telephone facility are outlined during training and education courses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sexual harassment is an abuse of power. Responsibility for eliminating it must rest with the employer and with the perpetrator. The Government agrees that, where possible, it is preferable that complaints be resolved informally between the parties. However, to place responsibility, in all cases, on a complainant to confront a perpetrator does not take account of the sensitivities and the power differentials in many working relationships. This is why a range of support mechanisms must be available to assist in conflict resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Headquarters Australian Defence Force maintains a register of all Sexual Harassment Contact officers which is periodically reviewed, re-issued and advertised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Navy:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">re-examine the adequacy of the nine week qualified entry officers' course and the reserve officers orientation course and consider extending the courses to a full six months;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consider setting a minimum recruiting period to allow for longer training;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">give new medical recruits the opportunity to take day and weekly running trips before taking up a longer sea posting;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">wherever possible, give new medical recruits a sufficient period on shore before posting to sea;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">make a determined effort to post medical officers to ships in time for them to take part in the work-up of the ship before deployment;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">identify specific naval tasks that can be effectively undertaken by medical and dental officers at sea in addition to their professional medical duties to assist them in being accepted as fully integrated members of the team; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensure that the qualified entry officers in both the Reserve and the Permanent Naval Force are clearly informed about these additional tasks and are adequately equipped, during their initial training, to carry them out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in Part</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The qualified entry officers course has recently been extended to 13 weeks and incorporates a two-week sea phase. This is intended to cover all the non-specialised training required for qualified entry officers on joining the Navy. Validation, including reviewing the course length,  will take place on completion of the first extended course. It is not feasible to extend the Reserve Officer Orientation Course to 26 weeks because, generally speaking, Reservists are not able to take leave from their primary employment for such a prolonged period. This is the main reason why this course is presently two weeks' duration. The content and duration of this course is currently being examined. Options for providing sea familiarisation to Reserve medical officers are being examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extending the initial minimum service period for qualified entry officers to cover additional training is not considered viable, given the difficulties in attracting such officers for Naval service for the currently prescribed period of Short Service Appointments. To extend further the initial service period would only exacerbate the current difficulty being experienced in recruiting qualified medical officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The posting policy now in place requires a new entry medical officer to be posted to a shore billet for the first year of full time service before being considered for sea service. This allows them to become familiar with the Navy and to complete their training in the Navy medical specialities such as nuclear, biological, and chemical defence, underwater medicine, aviation medicine, management of severe trauma and burns, sports medicine and gynaecological emergencies at sea. A similar posting policy for Reserve medical officers is being examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every effort is now made to post medical officers to sea in time to take part in the ship's workup. However, this is not always possible due to regular shortages in the number of medical officers required throughout the Navy. Also, not all ships undergo a workup prior to deployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to Divisional Officer duties which are undertaken by officers from all branches, collateral duties such as Entertainment Officer, Sports Officer, Education Officer and Resettlement Officer have in the past, and continue to be, allocated to medical and dental officers. Such duties are carefully allocated to ship's officers by Commanding Officers with due regard to the interests, capabilities and availability of individuals. The issue of collateral duties for medical and dental officers at sea is being examined in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the provision of the medical services on board naval vessels be reviewed, with particular focus on the benefits to be gained from making sea postings available to registered Navy nurses. The review should include an evaluation of the benefits of replacing Petty Officer Medic positions with fully qualified nursing staff, as well as the feasibility of nursing staff, in certain circumstances, being appointed to replace medical officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in Principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rigorous nature of Service life requires that all personnel be fit and healthy and capable of operational deployment. The Australian Defence Force recognises that personnel may be exposed to significant risks during the conduct of their duties and seeks to provide a level of care equivalent to that provided in the civilian community and commensurate with the inherent risks of the tasks at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the Australian Defence Force, the health team comprises medical, dental, nursing officers and medical assistants of both genders who provide care relevant to operational requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Navy, the provision of medical services at sea is continually under review due principally to the introduction of new classes of ships which have smaller total crew than those they replace. Other issues that determine the level of medical services are the operational role, area of deployment and access to medical support from other ships in convoy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under peacetime conditions the posting of a medical officer to each major Fleet unit is not warranted by the size of the dependent patient base. A medical sailor with advanced clinical skills (which equates to a medical assistant with additional skills in diagnostic and management procedures), provides an adequate level of medical care. Registered nurses and medical sailors with advanced clinical training are not interchangeable. Registered nurses could assume this role with additional training in some diagnostic skills and familiarisation with the seagoing environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of medical officers at sea is that of providing a higher level of treatment, particularly in remote areas or when there is a risk of injury in combat situations and when it is impractical to divert the ship from its primary role. In such circumstances the replacement of medical officers by nursing officers would not result in an enhanced higher level of care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is true in recent years that the Navy has experienced a shortage of junior medical officers available for sea service, this situation has arisen from a previous decision to cease undergraduate entry recruiting. Resumption of undergraduate recruiting has taken some years to restore staffing levels. The effects of normal wastage and the introduction of structured training to prepare medical officers for an initial sea posting have also taken some time to redress the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The view of the Committee that `many of the nurses now in the Navy have substantial Navy experience behind them that would stand them in good stead at sea' is not substantiated by the fact that presently 11 of the 19 Lieutenants/Sub Lieutenants have served less than five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding, it is intended to conduct a review encompassing the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the scope of any supplementary training required for registered nurses to meet the skills required for a single health billet at sea;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the requirement for a registered nurse to have commissioned officer status or not and consequent accommodation requirements on future ships;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the influences on recruiting and retention of nursing officers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the balance of male/female nursing officers and implications for posting to mixed gender ships; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the influence on retention of medical sailors with reduced opportunities for sea service at higher ranks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the implementation of the women at sea plan and posting policy, Navy endeavours to post one female medical sailor to every major Fleet unit which has female sailors embarked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Army has a comprehensive medical support structure which has evolved due to the nature of the battlefield. In Army's Area of Operations, the medical capabilities increase as a casualty is evacuated to the rear. At the `front', medical assistants and medical officers are integral to combat units, such as infantry battalions, and carry out emergency medical aid to casualties before evacuating them rearward. Within, and progressively to the rear of the logistic support area are the field ambulances, field hospitals, general hospitals and then, regionally located in Australia, the military hospitals. It is in these medical support facilities that casualties can be held, treated and nursed and these units are staffed with medical officers, nursing officers and medical assistants who provide the appropriate level of medical support and care for the casualty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the Army structure, medical and nursing staff are well utilised in their roles and, where the need arises, can be deployed wherever there is a need for their respective skills. For example, medical detachments for United Nations' deployments are custom-designed to meet the needs of the size, location, mission, and, where possible, the gender composition of the force, as well as the health threat and the cultural and religious background of the host country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Force nursing officers provide nursing care in all Air Force health facilities. In addition, nursing officers provide operational health support, aeromedical evacuation and general and specialised nursing duties during exercises, deployments and peacekeeping duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The medical assistant in the Air Force supports the nursing officer and the medical officer and while there may be some overlap in the capabilities of the nursing officer and medical assistant, the two groups function cohesively to provide optimal health care to patients. The level of training required by specific procedures determines the appropriate person to perform the given task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that an in-depth review be conducted of all positions at sea with the objective of more clearly identifying the personal characteristics, skills and aptitudes that are considered essential for service at sea.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navy does not support the proposition that sailors be allowed to remove themselves from ship billets if they develop reservations about their ability to handle life at sea. To allow such a situation would have the potential to affect operational effectiveness and to create posting turbulence with resultant short notice postings to other sailors. This in turn would have the potential to lead to family crises, dissatisfaction with Service life, discharge and shortages of trained personnel. Current policy provides avenues for Commanding Officers to land personnel who are assessed as being unable to fulfil their sea service obligation due to welfare or medical reasons, or where there is a degree of incompetence or disciplinary problems which warrant discharge action being taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Army has similar criteria to the Navy and has scheduled a similar review to be conducted for all Army trades during 1995/96.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force invests significant resources, both financial and training, in each of its members. Therefore, people applying to join the Australian Defence Force must satisfy stringent selection criteria to ensure that they are committed to and capable of performing the tasks that the Government has set for the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During basic recruit and officer training, any member who considers they are unsuited to military life may apply for discharge. Conversely, the Services can discharge persons identified as unsuitable for military life during this period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All potential new entries to the Navy are afforded an opportunity to discuss and fully evaluate the difficult and demanding aspects of service, especially at sea, before making a firm commitment to the Navy. These discussions take place during the recruiting process and during initial training. Recruiting staff consist of members of various branches so as to enhance the effectiveness of the counselling process. If qualified staff are not available, applicants are referred to experts either by phone or through a visit to a ship or establishment. Personnel who apply for employment in specialist areas must satisfy further selection criteria specific to those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Army recruiting process, all direct entry applicants are interviewed by the nominated Corps (specialist) representative in the region.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 15</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that all personnel in the Navy are assessed in the routine appraisal process for their capacity to develop a good working relationship with other personnel, no matter what their gender or sexual preference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Service men and women are selected, in part, for their ability to operate as a team member. Therefore, personnel are assessed regularly during their careers on how well they relate to, and work with, their colleagues, both male and female, as part of a team.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Services and the Australian Defence Force Academy have reviewed the criteria used in their performance appraisals to ensure that these aspects are assessed. This is an ongoing process and criteria will be revised if found to be deficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 16</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that all personnel with supervisory and management responsibilities are assessed for:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Personnel who are selected for supervisory and management responsibilities are assessed against broad criteria to determine their skills and abilities in managing staff. This includes their skills in integrating and facilitating the integration of women. The existing criteria adequately encompasses the Committee's Recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compilation of performance reports does not involve specifically seeking a subordinate's views, and they are not normally consulted. However, the supervisor's working relationship with subordinates and the supervisor's management effectiveness is scrutinised and taken into consideration as part of normal performance assessment practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 17</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the guidelines for the performance appraisal be reviewed:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to clarify the approach that supervisors should adopt to matters such as inadequacies in the assessee's training for tasks, short assessment periods and lack of opportunity for the assessee to demonstrate the particular skills for which he or she is being assessed; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that all supervisors are consistent in their approach to performance appraisal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Performance appraisal systems are based on the principles of honesty and integrity but they may be subjective and standardisation can be difficult to achieve. Each Service has set guidelines and procedures for personnel who are required to compile these reports and every effort is made to ensure that assessors follow a consistent approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navy guidelines for both the officers' and sailors' performance appraisal systems are being revised to take account of this Recommendation. Performance appraisal reports may be subject to modification by Navy Office to ensure consistency in reporting across the ranks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Army personnel are strongly encouraged to provide supporting comments in the performance assessments that they raise on their subordinates, both soldiers and officers. These comments are required where assessments are markedly higher or lower than the norm. All reports have a specified minimum observation period. In all circumstances, Commanding Officers can defer the compilation of a report, if it is felt that an unfair assessment would be reflected, due to a lack of training or adequate observation. To ensure that a balanced view and assessment consistency is obtained, all reports are commented on by the member's Head of Corps. Reports are then further standardised, at the highest level in the process, either by an adjustment based on an assessment of the reporting officer (for soldiers) or by a comparative cohort history analysis (for officers). In cases of specialist members, such as direct entry officers, often a senior officer within the member's specialisation will have additional input on that member's technical profi ciency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Force personnel are also encouraged to provide supporting comments in performance assessments. This is mandatory for markedly high or low assessments. Air Force performance assessments are subject to minimum assessment periods and assessments must be deferred to ensure that the minimum period is satisfied. Personnel undertake training in raising  performance appraisals during the promotion and training courses which all members complete during their Air Force career.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 18</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that a full-scale review of the Divisional System be carried out. The review should include in particular:</PARA>

A flow-on positive effect is a more open communication between staff and their superiors on issues affecting the workplace</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navy's Divisional System, and the Army's and Air Force's chain of command, place responsibility for the welfare of subordinate personnel on superiors who are required to address incidents of unacceptable sexual behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The toll-free numbers and quality management programs that exist in each Service provide complimentary tools to the Divisional System and chain of command.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Navy has commenced work on a comprehensive review of the Divisional System which will address in detail all the aspects outlined in this Recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chain of command for Army and Air Force will be reviewed in accordance with this Recommendation. Focus groups conducted on a regular basis by Army and Air Force, indicate that the majority of personnel have confidence in the chain of command.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 19</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the potential for tensions between the principles underlying the Chain of Command and the more participatory problem solving principles of Navy Quality Management be openly and more fully addressed at every level of management training in the Navy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Navy, training in the principles and practice of Naval Quality Management (NQM) have now been included in basic entry courses for both officers and sailors. An essential element of this training is to point out where and when the principles of NQM might apply and when a more authoritative approach might be more appropriate. This is intended specifically to address tensions which might arise from conflict between the two approaches to management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, a review of Leadership Management and Personal Development training in the Navy has been undertaken. The report of this review calls for a fundamental rethink and recommends that a continuum of training be developed for officers and sailors from Midshipman to Lieutenant Commander, and Seaman to Warrant Officer, respectively. The concept of a continuum has been endorsed, and the formation of a team to develop the training package, drawing on subject matter experts as required, is currently being examined. This training will also help to clarify the issues of NQM and traditional management methods for officers and sailors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Army Total Quality Management (TQM) is one of a range of management tools available to commanders for continued improvement within their units. From 1995 TQM will be incorporated into Army's through career training program. A comprehensive Army awareness program is underway to ensure that the philosophy of TQM is understood and to minimise the tensions between the principles underlying the chain of command and the more participatory problem solving principles of TQM.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Air Force introduced a TQM program in 1988. This program encourages participation by all staff members in the management of their workplace. A flow-on benefit is a more open communication between staff and their superiors on issues affecting the workplace. In keeping with this style of management, education and training sessions currently being delivered across the Air Force encourage supervisors to accept that Equal Employment Opportunity responsibilities, including sexual harassment, are both leadership and management issues. Surveys conducted before and after education sessions at the bases at which education has taken place to date indicate a marked change in attitude by supervisors.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In supporting the above Recommendation, the Government notes that Paragraph 6.190 of the Committee's Report indicates that the Committee did not intend the recommendation to apply to situations in which a complaint is eventually unsubstantiated as opposed to situations in which a person knowingly makes an allegation which is false, misleading, vexatious or malicious. The Government recognises that there is also a need to ensure that complainants are protected from victimisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The giving of false or misleading information by any member who knows that the information is false or misleading during a Service investigation into unacceptable sexual behaviour, may be subject to administrative action or action under the Defence Force Discipline Act. A Commanding Officer, or other officer appointed to investigate an allegation of unacceptable sexual behaviour, who believes, or is satisfied that false or misleading information has been deliberately given, should seek legal advice as to the appropriate course of action to be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any Australian Defence Force member has the right at any time to pursue a complaint of sexual discrimination or harassment through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. All persons involved in a complaint before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are required to be honest and accurate in their evidence. A person who furnishes information or makes a statement knowing that the information or statement is false or misleading may be subject to a penalty under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act s.25 and the Sex Discrimination Act s.93. The Sex Discrimination Act also provides for the Commission to dismiss a complaint that it considers to be frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance. However the Government is concerned that these provisions do not act to inhibit a genuine complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee identified in its Report a perception that there was scope for abuse of the complaints process under the Sex Discrimination Act.

Personnel who believe they are being subjected to sexual harassment should be encouraged and given support in resolving the conflict at a personal level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any Australian Defence Force members who believe that they are being subjected to sexual harassment are encouraged and given support in resolving the conflict at a personal level. The Australian Defence Force believes that the preferred method, and often the most effective way, to prevent the continuation of sexual harassment is for the person offended to approach the harasser, state clearly that the behaviour is offensive and demand that it ceases immediately. However, the Government recognises that there are some cases of sexual harassment where informal resolution is inappropriate and the parties involved need to be aware of the alternate avenues that may be followed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navy has an informal conflict resolution process through the Divisional System. Personnel attending Good Working Relationships training and callers to `Operation Lifeguard' are advised of this process where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Army strongly emphasises to its all personnel that the best method of resolving complaints is informally, at the local level. It is reinforced in all training, policy and information statements on harassment and discrimination issues and by the Army Helpline service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Air Force policy is that complaints of harassment should be resolved informally, at the local level wherever possible. This advice is contained in directions to commanders and supervisors and is reinforced in education and training packages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force Academy during initial training programs stresses that complaints should be resolved informally at the local level. This is further reinforced at the senior cadet level and is monitored closely by Academy staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)If, however, a formal, internal complaint is proceeded with, the procedures followed and the mechanisms that are in place should give assurance to the complainant that the complaint is being fully and properly investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mechanisms are in place across the Australian Defence Force, whereby a complainant is counselled and offered appropriate advice and guidance. During this process the member is reassured and afforded the opportunity to discuss any concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All parties concerned are assured that should a complaint proceed to a formal internal complaint, the allegation will be investigated thoroughly and with sensitivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)If the internal investigation is not satisfactory to the complainant, or if the person harassed encounters difficulties in pursuing this course, information on all alternative options (eg an approach to HREOC, or to the Defence Force Ombudsman) should be made readily available.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Recommendation has been implemented across the Australian Defence Force. All personnel are made aware of the external agencies which are available to investigate complaints of sexual harassment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Instruction has been amended to provide comprehensive guidance on complaint procedures through external agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)Recourse to courts martial for resolving complaints of sexual harassment should be regarded as a last resort, after other avenues for resolving the problem have been fully explored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Courts martial are convened only to try serious offences; they are not a mechanism for resolving complaints of sexual harassment. The convening of courts martial follows the most rigorous examination of all the issues.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Force policy detailed in Defence Instruction, DI(G) PERS 35-3, issued jointly by the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of the Department of Defence, requires managers to ensure that a member lodging a complaint will not be subjected to retribution. This is reinforced during Equal Employment Opportunity and sexual harassment training throughout the three Services and at the Australian Defence Force Academy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in Principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force recognises the sensitivities surrounding the investigation of sexual harassment allegations. Each Service, within the limitations of operational requirements and personnel levels, is committed to conducting investigations so that justice is done and is seen to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The guiding principle for the conduct of investigations within the Services is that the investigating officers are not personally acquainted with any of the parties involved in a sexual incident. However, the Government recognises that there may be some unique circumstances where this is not possible due to operational demands. Nevertheless, in such cases, if either the complainant or the alleged offender object to the investigating officer on the grounds of personal knowledge, another investigating officer will be appointed. In the case of Air Force the operational environment permits appointment of investigating officers of commissioned rank from another unit. Where difficulties arise in appointing investigators within the parent Service, assistance from civilian consultants or from the other Services may be sought. In cases of sexual assault occurring within Australia, investigations are invariably conducted by the relevant State police authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three Services have adopted similar measures of liaising with specialists in the investigation of sexual harassment allegations. The police component of each Service maintains a close link with their State and Federal counterparts. Both Army and Navy undertake Australian Federal Police training in the sensitivities and complexities of sexual harassment investigations, in addition to their internal training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Headquarters Australian Defence Force in conjunction with the Services, is currently preparing a training package including a video to be given to any officer appointed to conduct an investigation. This package will complement the training in each of the Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VI<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ensuring that supervising officers are accountable</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)The performance appraisal forms of each Service should be revised so that the extent to which all personnel adhere to the guidelines on unacceptable sexual behaviour is assessed, including the extent to which senior officers carry out their responsibility to take appropriate action to investigate quickly and fairly any allegations of sexual harassment. Care should be taken to ensure that these assessments are given equal weight by, and are comparable across all the Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in Principle</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The performance assessment criteria listed in this Recommendation are too specific and can be considered elements of the existing inter-personal and management skills criteria. These are intrinsic to assessing management and leadership ability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a practical difficulty in including very narrow assessment criteria in personnel appraisal forms which relate to situations or events which are unlikely to be encountered by the vast majority of personnel. Unless an incident has occurred, personnel would not have an opportunity to demonstrate their skills, and this would preclude any valid assessment of performance. Singling out sexual behaviour as a specific element of the performance appraisal process places a disproportionate emphasis on one aspect of human behaviour and inter personal relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force therefore prefers to treat the management of sexual behaviour as one element of the assessment of inter-personal relationships, management and leadership skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VII<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clarifying organisational responsibility</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)Steps should be taken urgently to establish clearly whether the ADF or the Department of Defence has the responsibility to ensure that proper sexual harassment policies and mechanisms are in place for handling sexual harassment allegations in establishments where both military and civilian personnel, including contract personnel, are employed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the streamlining of Australian Defence Force functions, in particular the Commercial Support Program, increasing numbers of civilian personnel, both Public Service and contract, are working side by side with their uniformed counterparts. In this integrated environment, the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence maintain distinct mechanisms for addressing personnel management issues. However, both organisations have a shared responsibility for implementation of these policies, in jointly prepared guidelines, `Eliminating Harassment in the Integrated Defence Environment' which apply to both civilian and Service personnel. These guidelines will be issued by the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Explicit in these guidelines is the need for the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force to consult on complaints of sexual harassment which involve both military and civilian personnel. In any case, where any doubt exists as to which `employer' is responsible for dealing with a complaint of sexual harassment, the matter will be resolved by consultation between Headquarters Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence. If a member of contracting staff complains of harassment by any Defence employee, they are encouraged to take the matter to their employer (the contractor) who will take the matter to the Department's Liaison Officer for the contract under which they are employed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While each of the Services has separate mechanisms for handling sexual harassment allegations within the civilian and military environment, Headquarters Australian Defence Force will complement this mechanism with the publication of these guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VIII<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monitoring sexual harassment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)Mechanisms should be established for an accurate and comprehensive on-going record of the number and kind of sexual harassment incidents occurring in the ADF.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)The Committee notes that, from the records currently available from the 008 numbers, there appears to be a significant difference in the kind of calls being received by the Navy and the kind of calls being registered in the other two Services. In particular, the level of incidents of general harassment in the Navy appears to be as high as that recorded for sexual harassment. All Services should ensure that general harassment as well as sexual harassment is identified and recorded. The categorisation of the calls should be standardised across all the Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>

An exit questionnaire is currently under consideration and will be used in the exit interview.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comparative data on the difference at separation in the ranks and length of service between male and female personnel is already maintained by the respective human resource planning directorates in each of the three Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)The Services should conduct a survey similar to that conducted by Major Quinn in 1987 to provide data on women's perceptions of sexual harassment since the major policy changes on integration were introduced.

It is also essential that the Services develop their own internal expertise in every aspect of the management of sexual harassment, including expertise in group dynamics and conflict resolution. However, there would be value in setting up an Advisory Panel to meet periodically with the Defence Force Policy Committee to assist the ADF carry out this responsibility. The Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the Defence Force Ombudsman, and the present consultants to Navy and the ADF on sexual harassment should be included on the Advisory Panel. In view of the many integrated civilian/military establishments, consideration should also be given to including a representative of the Merit Protection and Review Agency. The HQADF and single Service EEO Units and personnel providing the 008 services should, as a matter of course, participate in meetings with the Advisory Panel.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the ADF develop further the ADF's guidelines on appropriate professional behaviour and inter-personal relations. Particular attention should be given to both the process of arriving at those standards and the process of promulgating them. The Navy's approach of conducting focus groups to identify issues, followed by service-wide seminars which encourage communication and open discussion of the issue of unacceptable sexual behaviour in the context of appropriate overall behavioural standards provides an effective model for dealing with sensitive and complex matters of this kind. Similar processes should be put in place by all the Services to address the wider issue of professional inter-personal conduct, including general and sexual harassment, and mechanisms put in place for eliminating harassment of any kind from the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force accepts the fact that the problem of sexual harassment is part of the wider phenomenon of general harassment. The Australian Defence Force will seek to formalise and reiterate the standards of the military profession of respect, courtesy, fairness and good faith. Headquarters Australian Defence Force is examining the feasibility of preparing a military code of ethics along the lines of the ethos and values programs already in place within the Army.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 42</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee endorses the principle of equal opportunity for women in the Australian Defence Force and recommends that high priority be accorded to removing, to the maximum extent possible, any remaining barriers to recruitment and promotion prospects for women in the Services. To achieve this, high priority and resources should be given to reviewing criteria for advancement in the Services to reflect accurately the full range of complementary skills and attributes required for an effective and efficient Defence Force. Particular care should be taken to ensure that policies on access to facilities, physical strength requirements, pregnancy leave, fraternisation and the pre-requisites for promotion, do not unfairly or unnecessarily disadvantage women. Equally importantly they must not be perceived as giving an unfair advantage to women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to the principle of equal opportunity for women in the Australian Defence Force. In line with this, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel announced a number of initiatives in late August aimed at maintaining the momentum towards providing equality of employment in the workplace by introducing several initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first initiative is the establishment of the Defence Advisory Forum on Discrimination to address the challenges of discrimination and inequality in the workplace. This Forum, comprising senior executives from the corporate sector, tertiary institutions and the Government, should assist senior Defence management in maintaining an awareness of contemporary community programs, trends and strategies in combating discrimination and inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further study will be initiated in early 1995 on the cultural and institutional barriers which impede the competitiveness of women in achieving higher positions in the Australian Defence Force. This study will also identify actions to be taken by the Defence Force to remove such barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conjunction with this study, a similar study will be conducted to identify reasons why more women in the Australian Defence Force are not making the Service a long-term career.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FEASIBILITY OF NATIONAL ID SCHEME, THE TAX FILE NUMBER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomed the tabling in October 1988 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Government welcomed the conclusions of the bi-partisan majority regarding the Committee's additional terms of reference flowing from the Treasurer's announcement in the May Economic Statement in 1988 that the Government would proceed with legislation to upgrade the integrity of the existing tax file number system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, the report states (paragraph 2.21):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee concluded that the tax file numbering scheme proposed by the Treasurer is likely to improve the efficiency of the taxation system and to assist in the elimination of fraud and abuse of that system."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also noted the Committee's view that it is essential that the uses of the tax file number be strictly quarantined so as to protect the privacy of the Australian community and so as to ensure that the tax file number proposal does not become a surrogate means of establishing a broader identification system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government further noted the acknowledgment of the Committee that it is always open to Parliament to amend legislation, with the exception of the Constitution, in the usual way (paragraph 10.22). There have been occasions since 1988 when different uses of the tax file numbers have been the subject of scrutiny by Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the amendments to the tax file number legislation have been purely administrative in nature. However, others have had the effect of connecting the revenue and income support systems more closely because most income support payments are income tested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latter category involves the tax file number being a pre-requisite for payment of income support and home owner grant entitlements. This approach was taken so that statements by claimants for income support as to their income and domestic circumstances could be independently and automatically verified. The Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 which was given Royal Assent on 23 January 1991 provides the authority for matching taxation and assistance agency data using the tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government welcomed the Committee's recommendations in relation to privacy legislation including the principles by which privacy may be protected, the establishment of an independent Privacy Commissioner, and the means of enforcing the principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his Second Reading Speech on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988, the Treasurer foreshadowed that privacy legislation was to be introduced. The Privacy Bill was introduced to Parliament on 1 November 1988. In an effort to protect the rights of individuals, the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">proposed the establishment of the Privacy Commissioner;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">set out information Privacy Principles;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">vested power in the Privacy Commissioner to develop privacy guidelines; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">articulated rules relating to enforcement, penalties and compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill received Royal Assent on 14 December 1988 and came into effect on 1 January 1989; the same date of effect as for the tax file number legislation. On a number of occasions since that time, the Privacy Commissioner has been involved in consultations with the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to privacy matters concerning tax file numbers. Those consultations have included discussions covering the employment, investment and welfare uses of tax file numbers. and the matching of information using tax file numbers as allowed by the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is satisfied that individuals' right to privacy is adequately addressed and acknowledged in the administration of the tax file number system. (This was reflected in the May 1989 Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the Administration of the Tax File Number System.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is satisfied that the Committee's recommendations regarding privacy have been fully implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Government noted the suggestion of Senators Hill and Alston that the ATO should, before proceeding to upgrade the tax file number system, make further efforts to extend its existing names and addresses matching system to interest reports for partnership, trust and corporate taxpayers. In doing so, Senators Hill and Alston correctly identified this as one of the major problem areas for the ATO, highlighted in the ATO's submission to the Committee. In actual fact, this is one of the key areas which the tax file number is intended to address. The reality is that there is no more accurate, efficient and effective way of matching vast volumes of externally obtained data to client computer records than to use a high integrity numbering system such as the upgraded tax file number. This is clearly evidenced in the private sector where business organisations use their unique client identifiers to accurately match millions of credit vouchers each year. The essential point is that whereas a `names and addresses' matching system results in confusion and thereby inability to correctly match examples, a numbering system avoids that problem.</PARA>

<PARA>I wish to speak to the government response to a report that the Standing Committee on Community Affairs presented earlier last year. This was a unanimous report by the committee, which worked very hard and held many consultations around the country. The issue is of vital importance. It affects many women, most particularly those over the age of 50. That the committee was able to come up with a unanimous report speaks very highly of the work of the committee and the hard work of the secretariat. We today have the government response to its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee made 27 recommendations in the original report. Of them, the government either accepted or supported 24. For a committee, that is not a bad rate at which to score support. It is an issue that traverses a number of things that are also the responsibility of the states. That would have made it more difficult in responding to the report. I understand from quickly reading part of the response that our report was sent to a number of the states for them to also comment. Some of their replies have been fed back into this response, which is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will highlight a couple of areas that I notice are outside the resolve of the Commonwealth to deal with. But there is a response, and things are being taken to the Australian Health Ministers Conference. One in particular is improving the level of travel and accommodation assistance available to women living in areas outside the major metropolitan areas who require radiotherapy treatment. Whilst this is primarily a matter for the states, concerns about the recommendation will be referred to the Australian Health Ministers Conference. That is a very important move and the way to go. As I said, our report traversed a number of areas that are also the concern of the states. The fact that they are going to be brought to the attention of the states is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another vitally important issue that we dealt with is the collection of statistics by the cancer registries of the states and territories. We recommended that the statistics collected by state and territory cancer registries be collected on a more uniform and consistent basis and that the data on cancers generally be provided to the Commonwealth government on a timely and regular basis to ensure that current national statistics on the incidence of cancers are readily available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government supported the recommendation in principle. However, it is powerless to do very much about it because it is dependent upon what happens at the state level. The uniformity of data collection is being addressed by the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in conjunction with the state and territory cancer registries. I commend those organisations involved in doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the core set of data and the standards imposed on this data are robust and directly comparable. That is also very important because we want to be able to compare the incidence, mortality and morbidity figures of breast cancer not only within Australia but internationally to know whether some of the treatment mechanisms that we are using are working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response goes on to state that the timely reporting of national cancer incidence data is dependent on the supply of data from the state and territory cancer registries. While some cancer registries are able to provide data 18 months after the completion of the calendar year, others are not able to supply data for up to four years after the completion of the calendar year. It gives several reasons for this: the nature of cancer reporting, such as the compilation of multiple reporting sources; the lack of resources; the volume of the case load; historical impediments; and legislative inadequacies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and state and territory cancer registries are attempting to improve the timeliness of national incidence reporting. We noticed when we started our inquiry that the reporting of incidence by a number of cancer registries was very out of date; some registries were more than four years out of date. Our inquiry served as a fillip to some of the states to get their registries up to date and to report on a more timely basis. To me, that is an extremely important issue and one that I hope the states will continue to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of the treatment regimes and being able to evaluate screening programs is dependent upon getting good, accurate and timely data through. If that is not going to happen in all the states in this country, we are going to find that we do not know where there is a timelag&mdash;that is quite significant if it is four years&mdash;in being able to evaluate and implement alterations and changes that need to be brought into play. I very much urge the states to take on board the need for this and to do something about improving the timeliness of their reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the back of the response, an attachment outlines the national program for the early detention of breast cancer and its communication strategy. We found a lack of education and knowledge in the community. For example, women under 50 are not encouraged to come. Women under 40 are certainly not included in the program because it is a mammographic screening program, not a diagnostic program. The difference between screening and diagnostic mammography is not well understood in the general community. I am pleased to see that there is a national program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a list of the terms of reference for the National Breast Cancer Centre, which was announced just as we were finishing our report. We obviously made a recommendation for it to fulfil a role which is outside what its role was going to be. We did that because we were not sure in our own minds. There is also a listing under the heading `Policy and practice in relation to symptomatic women in the program'. We thought about that issue very deeply, because it involves what is done if people with signs and symptoms who turn up to a clinic are loathe to go elsewhere. It also involves how they are incorporated into the mainstream system so that they do not go away, decide that they have made one attempt to have their problem dealt with and, because they did not get the response they hoped to get, do not bother again. That is also dealt with in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that our sister committee in the other place is now compiling a report on the treatment of breast cancer. I await its report with a great deal of interest. I thank everybody who was involved in this report for their contribution. We have made a valuable contribution to this issue. That is borne out by the fact that the government has endorsed just about every one of our recommendations. </PARA>

I also commend the government response. There must be few occasions when a government response is published with the endorsement of the opposition and the unanimous endorsement of the Senate committee concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to two aspects that are subsequent to the publication of the report and the government response. There are dangers in the program in so far as the recent publications on this issue show that 70 per cent of the target numbers have to respond to screening for it to be shown to be successful. That figure is not being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of it is that we have discovered since the initiation of this inquiry that women are not going back for re-screening after two years. If that does not occur, the program will fall down in terms of the early detection of breast cancer. There is a tendency for women to have a mammogram and say, `I have had my mammogram. I do not have breast cancer'&mdash;even knowing that one in 10 will not show up anyway. Having said that, time elapses, they forget and they do not go back for re-screening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two major issues must be addressed: firstly, women in the target group must come forward to have a mammogram; and, secondly, they must be re-screened. If 70 per cent of the target group do not come forward and then they all do not come back for re-screening, it will be a waste of money in terms of being able to prove that it has had an effect on the Australian community. With those two caveats, I am very happy to recommend the acceptance of the government response to the report of the Senate standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have one issue to raise with the government and that is in relation to the funding of biopsy, which is a removal of the suspect area to prove whether it is a cancer or not. Our recommendation was that biopsy should not be included. Admittedly, it is a state problem, but, speaking as a surgeon, it is essential in the management of the woman who has breast cancer, particularly from the surgical aspect, that the treatment should continue after the biopsy and that it should not be part of the screening program. If it is part of the screening program, the woman is handed over to the surgeon, having had surgery of some kind or another. This often distorts the picture and does not give the surgeon the full knowledge that he or she needs to have in managing that particular patient. It is a somewhat minor thing from the report's point of view but major to the individual patient concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our report and the government's response the National Breast Cancer Centre was established. I am very happy to report that the centre has produced its first publication which is to go to every general practitioner and surgeon in Australia to bring them up to date with the current management and detection of breast cancer. I particularly want to commend Emeritus Professor Tom Reeve, who was appointed head of that National Breast Cancer Centre, for the speed with which he has initiated the program and the quality and accuracy of the document that has been produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cast our minds back, we will see that in the last two years breast cancer has become a major issue within the Australian public's consciousness, not only from women's point of view but from the whole of the public's point of view. The NHMRC has been directed to pay particular attention to this and separate funds have been issued to be spent on the early detection of breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look back on my time in the Senate, I can speak with pride about the fact that I initiated this within the Senate itself and it had the concurrence of the Democrats, my coalition partners and the Labor Party. This is a unanimous report, as Senator West has mentioned. Speaking as a professional in this field, I was aware of the fact that something needed to be done to raise this topic within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an ongoing topic. The incidence of the disease is increasing. It will get worse as time goes on because of the ageing of the population. This is something that we will have to come back to at a future date. I am quite delighted about the raising of consciousness within the community and the fact that we have been able to put the pressure on the states to do something about it. The Victorian government has allowed its electoral roll to be used. This had not happened previously. I commend the response. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The main point that I want to stress very briefly this afternoon is the slowness of the government's response with respect to what is really a very important issue. We have seen extensively around Australia outbreaks of blue-green algae. Several years ago we saw 1,000 kilometres of the Darling River infected with blue-green algae and the impossibility for quite some time for people along the river to use that water because of its toxic nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had repeatedly in South Australia outbreaks of algae in the lower part of the Murray, specifically in the area of Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert, and this has made it impossible for people in the townships of Clayton, Strathalbyn and places like that to again use water for irrigation, stock purposes or, indeed, for human consumption. In the last fortnight I have heard that the people in Strathalbyn have had to switch to alternative water supply. It is a serious problem and one which is increasing in severity and in its spread. It seems to me from reading this government response that it is a totally inadequate response to a very important problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, the blue-green algae outbreaks are really only an indicator of a much more serious underlying problem with our water supplies&mdash;namely, that the quality of the water with respect to such things as tepidity, temperature, flow, nutrient content is deteriorating. What happens at the end of that long chain is that sometimes one has an outbreak of algae and that, in a sense, is an indicator of this deteriorating quality. For those reasons, I think it requires a much more vigorous and timely response than is indicated by this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself was published, as the document indicates, in December 1993. The government response refers back to the December 1992 statement on the environment by the then Prime Minister in which he gave a Commonwealth commitment to assist in the improvement of water quality. That was in December 1992; it is now almost February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One finds that throughout this report the government is taking note of the recommendations of the committee, that it is supporting the recommendations, but in fact very little is actually happening. This is against the deteriorating quality of water. Adelaide, for instance&mdash;fortunately, although I live in Adelaide, I do not have to drink Adelaide's water; I live in the Adelaide hills and have my own water supply&mdash;is seriously in danger of losing its water supply. If there is a combination of very low winter rainfall, similar to what we had in the last year, and high summer temperatures, an outbreak of blue-green algae would make it impossible for Adelaide to pump water from the Murray. In dry years the Adelaide city is sometimes dependent up to almost 90 per cent on Murray water being pumped into the essentially empty catchments of the Adelaide hills and then reticulated down to people in Adelaide itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that in itself is an extremely serious problem which has not received the sort of response that it should have from government. For instance, on page 3 the government's response states that there is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">growing community concern about the gradual deterioration in the quality of the nation's water bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an admission by government that there is a gradual deterioration, despite the fact that it gave an undertaking in December 1992 to do something about it. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Strategy will set an overall strategic direction for water quality management and is based on the principles . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is still future tense. The government is still about to do something. The government has not actually done anything despite the fact that it has been aware of this situation for quite a considerable period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one turns to the government's response to the specific recommendations of the report one finds that in relation to the country towns water supply improvement program the government has put up $16 million over a period of four years&mdash;that is, $4 million per year for the water supply of country towns throughout the whole of Australia. The government response goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993-94 as a result of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Statement</EMPHASIS> the Commonwealth provided assistance of $4.5 million to 41 wastewater projects in small centres . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is of the order of $100,000 each. It is a totally inadequate amount of finance to undertake the very important work which is necessary. Again turning to the Murray-Darling system, we know that many of the small towns along that very important waterway have inadequate waste water treatment, have inadequate sewage treatment and have inadequate treatment of nutrient run-off from farms. That is what is leading to the nutrient build-up in the Murray-Darling system and ultimately to the toxic blue-green algae. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention one other issue that I think should have been attacked far more vigorously by government: the issue of phosphorus in detergents&mdash;in household detergents, washing detergents and a range of commercially-used detergent products. The committee has made recommendations in relation to these detergents. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that existing and proposed campaigns to achieve lower phosphate levels in detergents through marketing strategies be continued.</PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if a significant reduction in levels of phosphorus in detergents has not been achieved within two years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we are already halfway through that period&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">then legislation be enacted to reduce levels or to ban phosphates in detergents.</PARA>
<PARA>These are quite reasonable recommendations which came from the committee. But we find again that the government is leaning over backwards to be kind to the detergent industry. I will read one sentence which I found quite horrifying when I read it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that reducing or eliminating phosphorus in detergents may not be enough to have a significant impact on reducing algal blooms while there are other sources of phosphorus reaching waterways and while there is already a store of phosphorus in streams and sediments.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the government is saying that, because two or three sources of phosphorus are getting into our streams, we will not tackle this very important source&mdash;namely, detergents, which could be tackled very quickly and very easily. Surely, any reduction in the levels of phosphorus is important, particularly in a country like Australia where many of the soils are very low in phosphorus and where, under those conditions, phosphorus is the critical nutrient not only in soil with respect to weed growth but also in our waterways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government response goes on to talk about the most acceptable mechanism from an industry perspective being the use of economic instruments. In other words, there is an ideological commitment to protecting the needs of industry rather than protecting the needs of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply stress that water is one of the most critical resources in this country. We have an extremely dry continent. We have a continent in which water is the limiting resource for much of our activity. We have a problem with deteriorating water quality. It is urgent for government to take the longer term view. I mentioned this earlier in connection with woodchips and the need for governments over the last three or four decades to have gone into plantation forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have another example of the need for longer term strategies. Unless government does not take note now of the importance of water, unless government does not act to remove phosphorus from detergents&mdash;remember that not too many years ago we did not have detergents; we used soap, and we got by quite well without phosphorus in detergents, so we can do it&mdash;and unless government is prepared to act and act vigorously, the problems which we are creating for future generations with respect to the quality of water will be very severe indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those impacts will be just as serious in the economic area as they will be in the social, human and environmental area. It is very short-sighted of government to be looking at the present industries and not looking at the needs of industry in the long term and the economic impacts which environmental deterioration will have on this country if government does not have a more adequate response to this issue than is indicated by this totally inadequate response to this committee report we have before us this afternoon.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The government responded to the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee by putting down this response on 12 December 1994. We are all aware that the government did well to have it ready for the final week of the Senate sitting last December, but there was a great congestion of business. I do not want to make any cheap points about it being put down on the first working day after the Senate rose. Rather, I wish to commend the spirit in which this whole inquiry was undertaken: with the utmost seriousness to seek a comprehensive inquiry by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee of the Senate and to gain the most positive response from the government towards our findings to see all the measures in place that would most seek to eliminate sexual harassment in the navy, army and air force&mdash;from the defence forces of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response is very much in that spirit. There is a real sincerity and substance in the way in which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Punch, advised by the Defence Force senior officers and indeed by the three services&mdash;the navy, army and air force&mdash;has responded to what I believe is one of the best Senate reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Jones, who is in the chamber and is the chairman of the committee, Senator Ellison, who also participated on that inquiry, and I, along with three other senators, have been commended by the government for the useful work that has been completed. We are impatient only to see in practice the actual implementation of the findings of the report in which we have placed a great deal of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background set out by the minister in the response is accurate. So is the context in which there is unanimity on the committee's part and the government's part that we firmly endorse the principle of equal opportunity for women in the Australian Defence Force. The government accepts fully the Senate committee's recommendation in the report that there needs to be enhanced education of gender related issues in the three services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A summary of the Senate report and a structure for the government's response is given. This usefully says that, although we had 42 recommendations, many of them were quite long and in several parts, and the government is responding not only to the 42 recommendations but to the 66 separate components of the Senate committee's report. Fifty-three of the 66 are fully supported. We welcome that. My remarks will concentrate for a few minutes on those others which the minister has listed. Four were supported in principle; five were supported in part; only two of the 66 are not supported; and a further two are still under examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a degree of misunderstanding in the government's perception of what our report said about the 13 recommendations that are not fully supported. No doubt that is partly the fault of our not writing it more clearly and partly because of some errors of communication. This misunderstanding particularly relates to recommendations 1 and 2 that concern the Sex Discrimination Act. We are all aware that the only person in Australia who took any exception at all to this report was the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. I thought that whilst she was no doubt trying to responsibly carry out the duties of her office, her remarks were rather emotional and overly verbose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the heart of the Sex Discrimination Act, which the commissioner rightly must ensure is implemented, she is in some way being put at significant risk by our call in recommendations 1 and 2 that there be amendments to three matters in that act: the hierarchy of complaints of sexual harassment; the advantage, wherever it is possible, to the complainant in informing the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour was offensive; and the provision of appropriate mechanisms, differentiated mechanisms, for dealing with the different degrees of seriousness of unlawful behaviour. We have in mind in particular that this will impact upon the army, the air force and the navy, because every member of the defence services is subject&mdash;as are all Australians&mdash;to the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand by not only recommendations 1 and 2 but by all of the recommendations of this report. I refer the government again to pages 30 and 31 of our report. On page 30 of that report, we said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The junior female officers on the SWAN told the Committee, for example, that the reaction of many of the crew after the unfavourable publicity it received in September 1993, was to withdraw from the normal interaction that had been developing, as the men came to accept the women's professionalism during the course of the deployment. A mixture of resentment and uncertainty among the male personnel over where the line on unacceptable behaviour was to be drawn had the effect of isolating the women.</PARA>
<PARA>We were referring to an unfortunate development which we were trying to remedy. Also, in the next paragraph we referred to the vagaries of the Sex Discrimination Act, which defines a `reasonable person' and which also has subjective elements with regard to the person feeling harassed. We have every sympathy for the law as it is now written. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put it this way: the second best situation is the Sex Discrimination Act as it is now written, but we are seeking, with regard to the practicalities of the army, the air force and the navy, some flexibility and some more certainty to be given so that men and women in the defence services are not driven to the difficulties that I have just tried to outline. To do that, we brought forward recommendations 1 and 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there are going to be situations where a person who is being harassed will find it totally obnoxious and impossible to confront their harasser. That is often the case in serious cases, and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner says that that is the case in the majority of cases in which complaints are brought. I do not argue with any of that. I do not want to have any argument with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, whose work is so important. Rather, I ask for that degree of sympathy for the flexibility that we had been seeking to note the hierarchy of complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sexual harassment can be someone displaying some offensive photograph. We call that a degree of sexual harassment. It is not directed at any individual, and it is not seeking any particular favour from any particular individual. Another level of harassment is where some person touches another person most offensively, or even offensively. That is another higher or more serious level of offence. A very serious offence would be a person requiring a sexual favour of another person in order for that person to gain some advantage or not to suffer some detriment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw in the navy in particular, but also in the army and air force, that this whole range of offences could land the offender, or the alleged offender, before the Sex Discrimination Commission. Therefore there was uncertainly amongst many personnel that, if they put up a particular photograph in one part of their cabin, this could lead them to be taken before the Sex Discrimination Commissioner because it can be construed, given the subjective element in the definition of what is in fact offensive, as offending in terms of sexual harassment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government to please look again at recommendations 1 and 2. Please try to understand what we said on pages 30 and 31. We are in no way wanting to insist that it be compulsory that a person being offended must go and speak with the person who is the alleged offender. We want that only where that is reasonable; only where that is going to stop a cumulative effect and actually nip something in the bud so that it does not become a serious offence. I accept the government's response to recommendation 2, which says that, whilst not putting this in legislation, it agrees with the committee but asks that this be a policy matter at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the two main areas where the government is disagreeing with the committee. I note that the other two matters that are still under examination&mdash;27 and 39V(a)&mdash;are dealing with trials where there are allegations of sexual assault. We are recommending that they be dealt with by a civilian criminal court and, similarly, the investigation towards the trial be dealt with by civilian investigation. This would be the case if the offence occurred anywhere in Australia but, if it occurs outside Australian waters, it would lead to only a court martial being applicable. We want that element to be carefully examined. It is being examined by Attorney-General's and Defence. We will, of course, listen very carefully to the analysis that eventually comes forward. I reiterate that I support the original recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matters supported in part are actually fully understandable. I do not see any difficulty with regard to visits, to telling an offender, to training, to reviewing the electronic warfare section, and to whether the 008 confidential advisory service is amalgamated or remains as three separate telephone numbers. With regard to the support in principle, the government response is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I very much welcome the government's response and ask that it give a more sympathetic reading to what we meant with regard to recommendations 1 and 2.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to comment on the inquiry into sexual harassment in the Australian Defence Force. As Senator Teague said, I was chairman of the committee that conducted the inquiry. I am very grateful that the government's response has, to a large extent, supported the recommendations made by the committee. Of the recommendations, 53 were supported, four were supported in principle, six in part and one was under examination. Only two recommendations were not supported and I will come back to those later. The two recommendations that were not supported were also referred to by Senator Teague.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pressure of time precludes me from covering every recommendation, but I would like to comment on several points. In a number of instances the government response draws attention to written orders and pamphlets et cetera as sources for advice on various aspects of military life. These documents are useful as far as they go, but I cannot stress strongly enough the need to deal on a personal level with the many issues associated with sexual harassment. This includes such a basic decision as the choice of a military career. These issues need to be dealt with on a person to person basis or in a small discussion group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter how much information is contained in documents, they cannot be seen as an adequate replacement for open, frank and informative discussion and dialogue about the personal issues involved. One aspect of this&mdash;the need for mixed gender focus groups of ADF personnel&mdash;is covered in recommendation 39-II(A). The response, which supports the proposal, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the services has mixed gender focus groups in place. When the Defence instruction is reviewed in November 1995 the input from the service focus groups will be carefully considered.</PARA>
<PARA>It would be very interesting to know how extensive these focus groups really are. It is puzzling that no mention of these groups was made in the original submissions to the committee.  Several of the committee's recommendations relate to the need for a practical guide to all personnel for dealing with instances of unacceptable sexual behaviour. The government's response tells us that headquarters of the ADF, in conjunction with the department, have prepared a detailed document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Eliminating harassment in the integrated defence environment</EMPHASIS>. It is to be hoped that this document will be available to every individual in the ADF and that it incorporates a section on conflict resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee urged that the ADF-wide awareness raising seminars should be supplemented by more specific training for any person wishing to develop skills and techniques for dealing with such harassment at the inter-personal level. The government's response supports the proposal and outlines the supplementary training offered by the three service. It should be noted that the response makes no mention of the Australian Defence Force Academy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee felt there was a need for the introduction of an external conflict resolution process. The response details the present channels available for conflict resolution. The section on the army's community justice program lists medical officers as among those available to provide conflict resolution. It is questionable on the evidence whether they have the training and capability to provide such a service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter raised during the committee's hearings was the question of the need for investigating officers to be appointed from outside the unit where the alleged incident occurred. While the response says that the ADF is sensitive to this issue, I would point out that it puts the view that individually deployed units must have the capability of conducting internal investigations. It also says that, if the commanding officer perceives that an investigation may not be impartial, guidance will be sought from a superior officer to appoint an appropriate investigating officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view, and I believe the committee's view, that in all but exceptional circumstances the investigating officer should be from outside the unit. The officer should not be acquainted with any parties involved in the incident. It is imperative that in any incident the complainant and the alleged offender must be apprised of their right to ask the commanding officer for an external investigating officer. The overriding principle must be that justice is done and seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to comment on the two recommendations that Senator Teague commented on. Neither recommendation was supported by the government's response. Recommendation 1 and 2 are interlinked and address the basic question addressed by the committee. A very important issue addressed in the committee's report was the damage that is done if sexual harassment is not dealt with promptly. Situations that may initially be mild or based on misunderstanding are allowed to fester and develop into major problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sought to encourage early intervention to resolve a situation that is unsatisfactory to someone before that situation evolves into a formal complaint. Once a situation or formal complaint has been reached, the prospects are that all parties to the complaint&mdash;the complainant as well as the alleged harasser&mdash;will be hurt. Even if an apology is given or monetary compensation is paid to the complainant, the complainant will inevitably carry the stigma of being called a whinger or someone who does not meet with the requirements that are held within the establishment they are working in. The committee felt that, if possible, such a situation should be pre-empted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sexual harassment should be nipped in the bud before the parties involved are damaged. It was with this in mind that the committee put forward recommendation 2. It is disappointing that the recommendation has not been accepted by the government. The committee particularly noted the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's training package for managers. This package encourages in-house informal resolution of sexual harassment complaints, yet it was not developed until 1993&mdash;nearly 10 years after the sex discrimination legislation was passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis has been on punishment for wrongdoing rather than education to pre-empt wrongdoing. Greater clarity for employers about their responsibilities, as set out in recommendation 2, would ensure better outcomes for all those involved. The government's response to recommendation 2 refers to an alleged lack of clarity&mdash;and I suppose the committee in some way must accept the responsibility for that&mdash;on whether recourse to in-house facilities would be a precondition to the lodging of a formal complaint. This is a matter which can be looked at in different ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue would have been clearer had the government accepted the committee's recommendation 1. This recommendation said that there should be a clearer distinction between serious sexual harassment, such as brutal sexual assault, and the more mild irritants that are perceived by some people as offensive. In instances of less serious types of sexual harassment, it would then have made sense to make in-house efforts or involvement of an outside body part of the informal conflict resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The in-house efforts or the outside involvement&mdash;such as by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner&mdash;would be a precondition for formal complaint. Where the harassment is, by community standards, widely regarded as serious, and there is no ambiguity about the offence, then clearly a direct formal complaint to an outside body would be appropriate. The finetuning involved in implementing recommendation 2 should not pose any major obstacles if the basic need to resolve difficulties before they get out of hand is kept clearly in mind. Sexual harassment appears to be a straightforward matter but, as the committee soon found, it is a very complex issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the committee was very pleased with the constructive way in which the government handled the other recommendations made by the committee. The work of the committee and the report that it produced were a credit to the members of the committee and to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fully support what Senator Jones said on this matter, in particular the way that the committee conducted itself in carrying out this most delicate and difficult inquiry. I believe that this report will stand as a beacon for future years on this problem of sexual harassment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the committee's terms of reference related to incidents that occurred on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS> in 1992 and also to the question of sexual harassment generally in the armed services, I believe that the wider community as a whole could benefit from this report. I think the government has realised that fact in its response to this report. It is interesting to note that, out of the number of recommendations that the committee made, there are only two that the government does not support. I believe that both Senator Jones and Senator Teague have eloquently touched on the problems that confronted the committee and the problems addressed in recommendations Nos 1 and 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government has misunderstood recommendation No. 2 of the committee, which was aimed at the early resolution of sexual harassment problems in the workplace. It was not a recommendation that stated that employers should take all reasonable steps to prevent an employee from engaging in unlawful acts of sexual harassment so that any victim of sexual harassment would first have to avail himself or herself of those `reasonable steps' and that not to do so would preclude that person from lodging a formal complaint with an outside body. It was not as structured and strict as that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Teague says, the committee was not proposing a legal hurdle, and that is where the government misunderstood the recommendation. The government said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not clear from the Recommendation whether recourse to `in house' facilities would be a precondition to the lodging of a formal complaint with an outside body.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee was looking for the employer to take all reasonable steps to put in place a system whereby the matter could be nipped in the bud internally&mdash;at the workplace, within the place of employment&mdash;and sorted out by negotiation&mdash;that is, by some form of conciliation between the parties&mdash;and thereby would not have to go on to any civil action in the courts. That is what the committee was getting at in recommendation 2. During the course of this inquiry, I believe, the committee found that there were a good many instances of sexual harassment which could be sorted out at that level without any formal litigation or sanction against an individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to recommendation No. 1, the situation is more complex. The committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the definition of sexual harassment under the Sex Discrimination Act be redefined to reflect more clearly</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the hierarchy of complaints;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the advantage, where possible, of the complainant informing the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour is offensive;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the appropriate mechanisms and legal sanctions for the different degrees of seriousness of the unlawful behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, there are varying degrees of human behaviour. We have recognised this in the law with our recognition of the varying degrees of assault. You can have common assault, assault occasioning bodily harm and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. That recognises the degree of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, a degree of inappropriate sexual behaviour has been recognised in the various states. I believe that, in the instance of sexual harassment, it is no different. I believe there should be recognition of a hierarchy of situations, starting with the lowest form of sexual harassment and going right through to the most serious form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the events on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS> in 1992, the question of sexual harassment has been canvassed a great deal in the wider community. At the moment, we have an American motion picture entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Disclosure</EMPHASIS> on this very subject. In fact, it provokes some thought by the viewer in that it is a woman who is perpetrating the sexual harassment against a male subordinate. That is not commonly regarded as the average instance of sexual harassment. </PARA>

The attention that it has attracted reveals this factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 1, the committee looked at the question of what is sexual harassment. In Australia, we have a society of cultures. As the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian society, perhaps more than most, is made up of a mosaic of cultural backgrounds and experiences. What is acceptable to one person may be unacceptable to another.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Kirsner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . many people come from cultures or families where touching is a routine and supportive activity.</PARA>
<PARA>When we look at the wider Australian community, we have to have regard to the fact that there are many different cultures. There are people in the workplace who have varied approaches to how you deal with grief and joy. Some people are more exuberant than others. Some people believe in touching more than is the case with other people. Some people are quite inhibited. What may be thought to be a very harmless gesture by one person can be received as quite offensive by another. It falls upon the legislature to bring in legislation which covers this situation and takes into account the varying degrees of human behaviour. It was Ms Triulzi, who had been engaged by the Navy, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what we need to understand is that there are lots of elements of grey in understanding what sexual harassment is and is not, and how we distinguish and differentiate those levels of grey.</PARA>
<PARA>That precisely is the point that the committee was looking at in recommendation 1. In December 1992, section 28 of the Sex Discrimination Act was amended. What was previously a more objective test was changed to a more subjective test, so that the offence that is created is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a person sexually harasses another person ("the person harassed") if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the person makes an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome request for sexual favours, to the person harassed;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words `would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended'. That requires a person in such an instance as the workplace to anticipate what the other person will feel. This becomes increasingly hard, having regard to the fact that I have mentioned&mdash;the diverse cultures and backgrounds that Australian society has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could be in a factory where there are many people of different nationalities and descents, and one has to go through this exercise of anticipation. One has to look at the other person who may have just won the lottery, or at someone whose close relative may have just died. One then has to ask oneself, `Is it sexual harassment if I put my arm around this woman and say, "My condolences", or if I slap this person on the back and say, "Congratulations on winning the lotto"'? The average person cannot possibly go through that exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government has ignored the problem with a lack of definition. That is precisely what this committee came up against all throughout this inquiry: what precisely is sexual harassment? I join with Senator Teague in asking the government to reconsider this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with Senator Jones, who chaired the committee, in expressing disappointment at the fact the government did not  not support the recommendations. In fact, I believe that Ms Walpole, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, took somewhat of a trite view in saying that that definition was sufficient and that there was no problem. It was not her role to be there of course, but it could have been of great assistance to her if she had been with us throughout the inquiry to see what level of grey there was. In a very minor instance someone could extend sympathy by putting their arm around a person's shoulder&mdash;that is at the low end of the scale&mdash;and that could be regarded as sexual harassment. It goes right through to someone touching a fellow worker in an offensive manner. In that say one can see the hierarchy of complaints and the area of grey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where legislation forbids this, I believe citizens must be given a clearer definition. If subjects throughout the country are to be expected to obey the law, they have to be given direction. It is our duty as legislators to tell them what they can and cannot do. I do not believe that section 28 of the Sex Discrimination Act does that. It leaves it to the individual to anticipate what another person might feel. I really do think it merits close attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sexual harassment is an important matter. I believe this committee provided a beacon to the community at large in relation to the problems faced in the armed services. I believe the committee addressed those instances, in particular in relation to the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS>, admirably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, in recommendations 24, 25 and 26, urged reconsideration of the censure of Captain Mole and argued that he not be impeded in his promotion. These were very good recommendations indeed and I note the government's response to them. I have made inquiries and I believe that Captain Mole has since been promoted and that his censure, whilst not being removed as yet, is under review. I am happy to report that to the Senate because I believe that this officer was serving the navy and his country well. As a result of the attentions of some of the media in this instance, he suffered a great deal. In fact, he suffered a setback to his career generally in the navy. I believe the committee saw that and that is why the committee recommended those things. I thought it important to place that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I urge the government to reconsider recommendations 1 and 2. I ask it to please look at that section in the Sex Discrimination Act.

<PARA>The Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council performs an important role; namely, it provides a forum to consider industry issues and provides advice to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) from an industry perspective. I think this report outlines the number of important issues the council addressed during the year in review. It provided technical advice to the negotiation process of the Uruguay Round discussions, which we all hope is going to do some good for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council has developed feedlot guidelines for the industry, which basically have been very worth while and very good for an industry that has increased in size and stature in Australia. It has also focused on establishing systems within the meat industry to provide more effective links between the producer and the consumer. While it is all very well for government bodies to work on these links, it is something that must be industry driven and meat producers themselves must appreciate the importance of the end user and the importance of, and the need for, consistency in the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that has caused a great deal of concern in the last little while&mdash;the helix contamination of some of our beef into some of our export markets. Some people have said that the AMLC levy should have been used to help some of those people with the helix contamination problems. Basically, there is a big concern by all of those people who have beef contaminated by helix which, as everyone in this chamber knows, was used to spray cotton. It is probably one of the best and softest chemicals that has ever been used in the cotton industry, but the Japanese and the Americans have nil tolerance of it. When the residue levels get up to one or two, the non-tolerance areas will not accept the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMLC has a very big part to play in that contamination scare. I think the job will now be left to the AMLC to make sure those markets that have been hurt by that particular scare are recouped. Quite often some of those other countries use some of these things as non-tariff trade barriers. It is quite interesting that the Japanese use helix to spray vegetables and everything else but they have a nil tolerance of it if it is in imported beef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report lists a number of project objectives. I am sure many of those are not known about. It does not list what this council's administration costs are, so I cannot comment on whether industry is getting value or not. I think it is very important that any of these industry councils make sure they give full accountability to the producers who make the funds available to keep the councils going on behalf of the growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that since this report was published the former chairman, Mr Bob McCarthy, has been replaced by Robin Bligh. I wish Mr Robin Bligh great success in his new job. I do not know the reasons for the change, but I am aware that there is some criticism within the industry of that change taking place. So I hope that the industry sticks together and does the right thing. If we are to have an industry council, the advice has to be objective. I hope that this is going to be so with the AMLIPC in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Brownhill's motion to take note of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council annual report. The objectives of the council refer to a body called the residue management group. Its second key objective is to protect export and domestic markets for animal products from disruption to trade and financial losses caused by chemical residue detections. It is in that area that I wish to make a contribution tonight. There are a number of issues concerning the beef residue testing debacle that has come to pass through the feeding of drought affected cattle and even feedlot cattle with cotton trash treated with the chemical helix, which incidentally, as Senator Brownhill said, is a very effective method of killing caterpillars at certain stages of cotton production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a number of concerns. Firstly, there seems to have been an extreme lack of leadership in the beginning, and a lack of understanding of the plight of farmers already suffering severe drought being isolated into areas regarded `at risk' and then being forced to substantially meet their own testing costs. The New South Wales government has, to its credit, given considerable assistance in this area. Secondly, the AMLC was not prepared to use its $5 million in residue testing funds which had been set aside, I assume, for precisely this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it seems that many northern cattle producers, both in New South Wales and Queensland, have been left in an appalling situation. The industry had washed its hands of many producers who had fed cattle through the most severe drought on record and who presently are unable to sell their cattle because they would be over the maximum residue level of this chemical. I am pleased to see that the New South Wales farmers are looking at some way of compensating these producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the fundamental point that seems to have been missed by the AMLC is that anything that interferes with Australia's legitimate claim as a clean and green supplier of beef to the world is a problem for all producers, not just for those presently affected by this particular residue problem. It is especially so for northern producers and Queensland producers. Their livelihood was further threatened by this unfortunate combination of drought and the CFZ chemical, which hopefully will not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry must be assured that in future a national management plan will be in place to handle future residue detection problems&mdash;and there will always be those problems. It must be there to answer questions quickly, to give leadership, to provide a speedy trace back of contaminants and, overall, to give confidence, to be of benefit to all producers and, most importantly, to give the sort of leadership our international market requires. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the first annual report of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, the Greens WA objected in the beginning to the whole idea of a levy to fund this corporation. The idea of making money from chopping down trees to pay a bunch of industry representatives and bureaucrats to research how the industry can be sustainable is bizarre. I can be optimistic but, given the attitude prevalent in governments, it is likely that this will only be yet another smokescreen&mdash;like the national forest policy, the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry or the ESD forest policy&mdash;designed to divert attention, while the trees keep falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By now we know that the way to make the industry sustainable is by agroforestry or to regenerate plantations on degraded, already cleared land. We know that adding value is the answer, not just increasing export volume to make up for declining prices. We know that the answer is not to eliminate the last stands of old growth forest and then try to become sustainable. How much more research do we need? CALM has researched agroforestry for years, but what has it done? It has lacked the will to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woodchipping is a tonnage export. It is a high volume, low value industry. It is a heavily mechanised industry that is shedding jobs as fast as possible. It is a large corporate dominated industry; it is a foreign dominated industry. It is not going to create great wealth, unless truly massive amounts of material are shipped out&mdash;and the actual benefits will be minimal, relative to expense and sensitive to price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1986 the price of woodchips has fallen dramatically. Brazil has brought seven million hectares of Eucalypt plantation on line; South-East Asia is bringing huge gum plantations on line; and Spain, Argentina, South Africa and China are all bringing gum plantations on line. These are all plantation based trees. Supply is up, the prices are down and the margins on woodchips are getting thinner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woodchipping is capital and technology intensive. It is highly mechanised in an effort to reduce labour costs. This is typical of high volume, low value products for basic economic reasons. It is not going to change. The trend to replace workers with expensive imported equipment will accelerate. The need for capital&mdash;usually foreign sourced capital&mdash;is also likely to accelerate. Three results will flow from this: jobs decrease relative to export volumes; imports increase relative to the profits from exports; and servicing of overseas loans increase as a portion of export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As further mechanisation occurs and volume of extraction increases, the use of intermediate inputs, such as fuel, increases. Where they are not imported, domestic supplies that could be used more productively are taken out of availability. Profits are also repatriated and so do not enter into multiplier effects here and are part of a capital outflow from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the issue of subsidy of forest products generally, and woodchipping specifically. Even without this, there are a number of factors which see money flowing out of the country as a consequence of the export of woodchips. This means that the actual contribution of woodchips to balance of payments is liable to be minimal or negative. At best, we are selling our forests for a mass of potage; at worst, we are paying people to take them away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the issue of subsidy to the forest industry. A 1990 New South Wales Public Accounts Committee reported that the state's timber processing industry is heavily subsidised. A Tasmanian report by Saddler, Kohl and Graham concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Forestry Commission, bulk power subsidies and transport subsidies amount to over $80 million per year. This represents a direct cost to all other industries in the State, the Government taxes other industries in order to subsidise forestry operations. The economic consequences of this are obviously serious and contribute to Tasmania's low economic growth and high unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA>Other reports at various times have yielded similar results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, these operations are not doing the economy any good. The only possible reason to allow them is a hatred of nature and a blind stupidity that believes that chopping down, digging up and killing things is a good way to be a hard-nosed pragmatist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Greens who are the practical people, the ones who wish to sit down with industry and work out a way through the current problems; and it is the woodchip advocates who are the ideologues. What are not included in this report are environmental goals; what are not included in this report are employment goals. If these were included, then we might get an outcome that we can look forward to, sitting down and working with those people who work in the industry, instead of just looking at the profits of very large corporations. </PARA>

However, I have been motivated to respond to that quite amazing contribution from Senator Margetts. Basically, what she has said to the people of Australia this evening is that the Greens are against the chopping down of any single tree, and that they are opposed to a most dynamic industry which has been very important in Australia's economy from the time of white settlement some 200 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation clearly is that it is within Australia's interests that there be research and development of forest and wood products. I would have thought that anybody who was genuinely concerned about Australia's future would be embracing a development corporation which is looking at developing our forest and wood products. I have to say that I agree it would be beneficial if our woodchips did not go overseas. But what happens? When we in Tasmania wanted a pulp mill at Wesley Vale&mdash;a mill which at that time would have been the most environmentally sensitive in the world&mdash;who were the most vehement opponents of it? It was the Green movement. So instead, the woodchips are being sent to Japan to be processed in a mill which is more environmentally damaging than the Tasmanian mill would have been. These people tell us to think globally and act locally&mdash;but their action with the Wesley Vale pulp mill was in exact contradiction to that policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts tells us that we ought to have studies and look at our forest and sustainability. We in Tasmania&mdash;as you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would know&mdash;have had to suffer in excess of a dozen studies. We have had the Helsham report and a whole host of others. But when it does not suit the Greens to adopt a report, they go for another one and another one and another one. Then, of course, Senator Margetts quotes from that famous report&mdash;which, I noted, had the name of one of the people from the staff of Senator John Devereux&mdash;as being one of the supposedly independent reports that they rely on. It is like the Greens, who seem to rely in Tasmania on their own polls, those that they conduct, and then try to sell them off to the community as having been done by an independent organisation, until they get caught out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, the amount of muddying of the waters that has occurred in this forestry debate is tragic. I do not have a hatred of nature, as suggested by Senator Margetts; I believe that we ought to live in harmony with nature for the benefit of human endeavour. The way to do that is to use renewable resources, such as wood, such as hydro-electric power&mdash;as we have in our state&mdash;which harnesses natural resources for the benefit of humankind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing the Greens will never admit to when they talk about nature and the world and all those wonderful things: human beings just happen to be part of nature; we are to live on this earth; we do have a place in this world. Just as much as rabbits might like to dig burrows for their homes and undermine little banks and trees from time to time, so human beings to make their homes in which they live will chop down trees. If that means that I am a hater of nature, then the chances are that the beavers in Canada, or wherever, that cut down little saplings to dam rivers are also haters of nature. If a little animal does it, it is okay; but when human beings want to do it, that is outrageous; that is a hatred of nature.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the motion to take note of the annual report of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. I will make some very brief comments. This report would normally be commended by the Greens because it endeavours to look at forests and wood products and work out ways in which the industry can become sustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the timber industry were sustainable at present, then we would be in the happy position of the industry never needing to log old-growth and high conservation value forests. Unfortunately, this insistence that the industry cannot survive without logging in old-growth and high conservation value forests means that the industry is not sustainable. It also means that, because there is such a reliance by this industry on these native forests, when those forests are gone the industry will not be sustainable in any sense of the word. It is certainly not environmentally sustainable now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pleasing to note that Senator Abetz said that renewable resources are what we are looking for. That is quite correct. I am very pleased to agree with Senator Abetz. However, in relation to the timber industry, renewable resources mean plantation and agro-forestry. Old-growth forests are not a renewable resource. Trees are renewable because they grow, but forests are not renewable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is very fortunate. It is an ancient continent. It has historic, beautiful, longstanding forests that have never been logged. If we log those forests that have never been logged before, then we are destroying them forever. They will never be renewed. Trees will grow, but forests are extinguished by the first logging and intrusion into them. Honourable senators need to learn the difference between trees, plantations and forests because old-growth forests are a unique ecosystem. They are very precious and valued world wide, but they do not seem to be valued in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list that the federal government has developed, which protects only some forests and leaves others vulnerable, even though the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) indicated they are high conservation value forests, is a hit list for the timber industry. It means that where you declare forests to be of high conservation value but you fail to have the political will to protect them, you render them vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To claim that it is the state's responsibility to protect those forest areas against road making and other activities is an abrogation of the federal government's responsibility. The states have already said that they will not protect even those 509 areas that have been reserved for rescheduling and assessment. Therefore, what we are doing is throwing away something very valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forest research levy, from which this study will be financed and which some of my colleagues in the Senate agreed to, is actually a way of giving permission to log all forests and trees for $1 a tree, whether it comes from a sawmill or is imported. The very important point is that if there is a $1 levy for each tree and that levy does not differentiate between a plantation log and a 400-year-old tree, then we are giving moral permission, through this funding to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, to act at the expense of our natural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of national interest that the federal and state governments do not have the political will to protect high conservation value forests and old-growth forests, and merely charge a levy of $1 per trunk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not come into the chamber to rebut some of the outrageous statements that the Greens have put on the record tonight, but I think it is an appropriate time to do that in defence of our native forests. Our forests are not disappearing. Australia has approximately 43 million hectares of native forest. Of that, just over seven million hectares, or one-sixth, of this estate forest is managed specifically on a sustainable basis for wood production. About one per cent of that seven million hectares is harvested and regenerated every year. That means that any area logged will, on average, not be logged again for 100 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that is worth making is that the forests are not logged for woodchips alone. Timber is a natural and renewable resource competing with non-renewable commodities like steel, aluminium and plastic. Native forests are logged for the purpose of providing sawn timber for housing, furniture and for use in the construction industry. The waste from sawmilling is then either converted into woodchips or burnt or wasted at sawmills. Similarly, in the forests, trees from the harvest area that are unsuitable for sawmilling are either chipped or left to burn or rot. If woodchipping were to stop, sawmills would still need the same number of trees to be logged. The only difference would be that the by-product would be wasted, and that has been put on the record a couple of times today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that no animal or plant has been threatened by logging. The federal government's Resource Assessment Commission determined with its exhaustive study into Australia's forests that there is no evidence that any plant or animal species has been threatened with extinction because of forest industry activities. Given that state forests have been logged for more than 100 years, this is sound evidence of the resilience of our forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point&mdash;and this is a question the Greens would like answered&mdash;is why do we not get all our wood from plantations? The reason is that Australia's wood needs are currently met about equally by domestic native forests, domestic plantations and imports. Australia's 100 million hectares of plantations could not supply further shortfalls from native forests. It simply means that we would have to import more. We presently have a current account deficit on the importation of timber or timber products of around $2 billion a year. If the Greens would like to see our current account deficit rise even more, then perhaps they should look to that as a solution. </PARA>

Due to the political uncertainty about the forests, which they engender, companies are not prepared to make the very large investment of up to a billion dollars that is needed to build plants for pulp and paper manufacturing in Australia. Senator Abetz, my colleague from Tasmania, knows a great deal about that. There is a provision in our export wood licences for chips to be first made available to domestic manufacturers for local processing. Only the surplus is exported.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the National Party in the Senate to extend our condolences to the family of Thomas Gilmore, who recently passed away at the great age of 87. During an extremely varied working life, Tom Gilmore served as both a federal parliamentarian in the Far North Queensland seat of Leichhardt and as a state parliamentarian in the seat of Tablelands&mdash;which is currently held by his son Tom Gilmore Jr.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lifelong member of the National Party, Tom Gilmore was born in 1908 in the mining town of Wolframcamp, west of Mareeba. After leaving school at 14, Tom Gilmore undertook many diverse jobs and the experience gained from working with a wide variety of people from all walks of life enabled him to be an effective representative of the Queensland people when he entered politics later in his life. Tom worked as a clerk in a hardware store, a tally clerk on the wharves, cut sugarcane by hand&mdash;truly backbreaking work&mdash;and he was also an ambulance bearer and a fireman on a sugar mill locomotive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1931, Tom Gilmore returned to the family tobacco farm and worked there until the outbreak of the Second World War when he joined the RAAF and served in Bundaberg and Sydney&mdash;age precluding him from participating in overseas war service. When he was demobbed in 1945, he was sent home to Mareeba with instructions to grow vegetables to feed the allied troops who were maintaining a strong presence in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1949, Tom became an inaugural member of the Tobacco Leaf Marketing Board. That same year he won the federal seat of Leichhardt, becoming a member of the Menzies-Fadden government. A conscientious and hardworking member, he served the people of Leichhardt well and was unfortunate to lose the seat in the double dissolution election in 1951. However, he made many political friends and was able to realise a long-held ambition to serve alongside such Country Party greats as Arthur Fadden and Black Jack McEwen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His friendships spanned the political spectrum with his forging of a friendship with Ben Chifley&mdash;possibly due to their shared experience as clerks and firemen early in their working lives. Ironically, it was Chifley's actions in opposing the restoration of the Commonwealth Bank Board, which had been abolished by him in 1945, that triggered this double dissolution&mdash;which was only the second in federal history at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom Gilmore continued to play a significant role in agropolitics and served for many years on the North Queensland Tobacco Growers Cooperative in the capacity of member and chairman. He also continued his strong involvement in the organisation he helped establish&mdash;the Tobacco Leaf Marketing Board. In 1957, Tom Gilmore entered state politics when he captured the seat of Tablelands. He continued his hard work for the people of the Tablelands and was an effective advocate for the tobacco and sugar industries that underpinned the economy of that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the honour of knowing Tom Gilmore personally. He was always an excellent fount of knowledge on the detailed workings of the tobacco and sugar industries and was generous in his time in providing me with information about these key industries. He was one of those people who was very highly respected in the National Party. He used to send us little memos when he thought we had done things that warranted his encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this 75th year of the National Party, it is very important to acknowledge the people who have made a significant contribution to the fortunes of the National Party&mdash;to acknowledge those who have played a role in the shaping of Australia's second oldest political party that developed from unification of farmers organisations in Western Australia in 1913, instigated to oppose the unconscionable trading practices inflicted on them by some merchants, to the truly National Party it is today with a presence in every state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lifelong National Party members who have devoted years of service to the party deserve our respect and appreciation. On behalf of the National Party in the Senate, I proffer our respect and appreciation for Tom Gilmore's many years of service to the National Party and extend our sympathy to his son and his family and his friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to put on record my appreciation and, I am certain, the appreciation of many of my colleagues in the House of Representatives of the life of Jack Birney, Reginald John Birney, who was the member for Phillip in the House of Representatives from 1975 to 1983 and who died earlier this month. I was fortunate to be able to attend his funeral in a packed church in Randwick with many people who had regarded Jack Birney with affection. People across all political persuasions went to pay their respects to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a `oncer'; in other words, he was one of those elected in 1975 who were derided by some members of the then opposition as people who would only grace the parliament for one term. We were called `oncers' and, as a result, we accepted that appellation with some enthusiasm when we got returned for two and three terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jack Birney survived as a member of parliament until 1983 and was, in fact, a genuine representative of his area. I campaigned with him on several occasions, and it was amazing to see how he seemed to be very friendly with people and known throughout his electorate. If one said that you could not go into a pub in Phillip without most of the people in that pub knowing him, that might give a false impression of his after-hours behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no doubt that he was a true son of that area. He played first grade cricket for Randwick. He was a wicket keeper. I suppose he had some of that mischievous, puckish sense of humour that wicket keepers have, particularly when you are about to face a difficult bowler from the other end and the wicket keeper will give you advice about the easiest way to get out to him. He played on the wing for Randwick Rugby Union Club and was a highly regarded sportsman. I imagine that most of us here in parliament remember him for his dedicated service to the people of Phillip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Jack Birney is now the third of those members elected in 1975 to the Liberal benches to have died. Senator John Knight was the first to die, in office. Jim Bradfield has also passed away&mdash;and now Jack Birney. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was elected in 1975 to the House of Representatives, so I was also alleged to be a `oncer', but I was, after defeat in 1983, elected to the Senate. Every year we people derided as `oncers' who have survived in politics have a dinner, and I know it will be a matter of major disappointment to all of us that at the 20th anniversary dinner, which will take place as near as possible to 11 November this year, we will not have Jack Birney's company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jack Birney's presence was always an occasion for humour and a touch of practical jokery. He emanated a feeling of genuine friendship and delight at being with his colleagues. I must say that, at our upcoming `oncers' dinner, Jack Birney will be very seriously missed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to pay my respects to the late Reginald John Birney. I must confess to one and all that I have never heard him called Reginald John Birney; he was Jack Birney. I, like my friend Senator Michael Baume, was one of those elected in 1975 who became known as the `oncers'. I think 43 of us were elected at that time. It was an election that changed the face of Australian politics. Jack Birney was an important part of that change. As Senator Baume said, he represented his electorate of Phillip for three parliaments until 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not have the pleasure of knowing Jack Birney as well as his New South Wales colleagues. He was very much a New South Welshman, but he was also a person who just oozed being Australian. He was a very rugged individual. He was a very laconic chap. He had a terrific sense of humour. He had a very dry sense of humour and a very sharp wit. He was very much a straight shooter. What you saw with Jack Birney was what you got. In that capacity, he was very committed not just to the Liberal Party and its ideals and principles but also to the wellbeing of his constituents, regardless of their political or other allegiances. As I said, he was very much an Australian. He was very committed to Australia's present and its future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with Senator Baume in saying a few brief words in memory of a man who was respected very deeply by all of those who knew him and who were his colleagues in this place. He will be very sadly missed, as Senator Baume said, by those many hundreds of people who attended his funeral and by the much wider community of contacts that he had as well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The next change to the Group Rental Scheme is projected for July 1995 and under current arrangements will not have any negative effect on DSS entitlements of ADF personnel.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Discussions were held on a number of issues relating to the DSS changes to assessments for family payments. The effect of the changes were discussed as a whole, including regarding negative gearing. While Government policy integrity was maintained in the income testing arrangements, agreement was reached on the anomalous impact of the treatment of rental subsidy for ADF members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognised that the treatment under the Social Security test ran across longstanding ADF policy which treats personnel at the same rank on a similar basis with regard to housing and provides subsidies which standardise housing costs, irrespective of their location. Such an anomalous impact was not seen as being the case for negative gearing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Spent nuclear fuel containing Australian Obligated Nuclear Material (AONM) in the Republic of Korea (ROK) remains subject to the provisions of the Agreement between Australia and the ROK concerning Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and the Transfer of Nuclear Material, which entered into force on 2 May 1979. Under Article VIII of this Agreement, AONM subject to this Agreement may not be reprocessed within the ROK or transferred to a third country without the prior written consent of the Australian Government. Requests for such consent would be considered on a case-by-case basis. No such request has been made in respect of reprocessing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Spent nuclear fuel containing AONM in Japan remains subject to the provisions of the Agreement between Japan and Australia for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, which entered into force on 17 August 1982. Pursuant to Annex B (the Reprocessing Settlement) and the Implementing Arrangement of the Australia/Japan Agreement, Australia exercises its prior consent rights on a programmatic basis so that AONM may be reprocessed in Japan or in an eligible third country as part of a long-term nuclear fuel cycle program. A condition of this programmatic consent is that the facility in which reprocessing will take place is included within the Delineated and Recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program (DRJNFCP). The DRJNFCP is an integral part of the Australia/Japan Agreement and the provisions of the Implementing Arrangement which outline the DRJNFCP are of treaty status and are published (along with the Agreement) in the Australian Treaty Series (No. 22 of 1982).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has also given programmatic consent to certain retransfers of AONM subject to the Australia/Japan Agreement within the Delineated and Recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program. In accordance with arrangements established in 1992, Japan notifies Australia of such retransfers, including those of spent fuel containing AONM, approximately six months in advance of each transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Australian uranium may only be exported or retransferred to countries with which Australia has bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements. These agreements lay down stringent conditions for the use and transfer of AONM. Within Australia's network of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements, five agreements (those with Euratom, France, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland) contain reprocessing settlements, allowing those treaty partners to retransfer and reprocess AONM under a programmatic consent regime based on conditions previously agreed to by the Australian Government. The remainder of Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements, except that with the Russian Federation, require prior written consent from Australia to be sought on a case-by-case basis before reprocessing of AONM could take place. To date no such consent has been sought. The agreement with the Russian Federation does not provide for reprocessing and only covers toll processing on behalf of third parties at the "front end" of the nuclear fuel cycle; that is conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication.</PARA>

In November 1990 Tasmania Bank experienced a moderate outflow of deposits following the announcement by the State Government of significant losses for that bank. The bulk of the outflow occurred in the first two days after the announcement. The Reserve Bank consulted with the bank during this period and was fully aware of the extent of the outflow. The Savings Bank of Tasmania's deposit holdings fell by 6 per cent over the four month period following the State Government's announcement of problems in Tasmania Bank in November 1990. By July 1991 this fall had been all but completely reversed.

Those institutions which had a solid financial base, recruited students from several countries and, therefore, were not largely dependent upon the PRC market, were able to adjust to the visa changes and sustain viable businesses which have contributed to the further development of the export education industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The options for the disposal of the former HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Derwent</EMPHASIS> after being decommissioned on 8 August this year were limited to sale for scrap, or sinking. This was as a result of a series of destructive tests planned by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. The sale for scrap option eventually became non-viable because of the extent of the damage to the ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The decision to carry out a series of destructive tests on the Derwent hulk was made because the planned disposal date for the Derwent coincided with the Defence Science and Technology proposal to conduct the Ship Survivability Enhancement Program. The program involves not only blasting tests but also fire, smoke, fragmentation and limpet mine damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The most important asset of the Royal Australian Navy is its personnel. Both the Falklands and the Gulf conflicts showed that the survivability of the ships themselves is critical for the survivability of the crews. In both these conflicts, little-understood secondary effects of weapon strikes significantly exacerbated the effects of the initial `hit'. In 1991, the Navy first proposed a series of destructive tests on a recently de-commissioned warship to validate computer models and engineering algorithms with a view to improving the combat survivability of Australian warships. As a result, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation developed the series of destructive experiments currently being performed on the Derwent hulk to collect data to assist the Navy to meet that goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) A variety of disposal options were considered for HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Derwent</EMPHASIS> and this included sale as scrap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The option to sell Derwent as scrap was not considered viable as the damage inflicted by the Ship Survivability Enhancement Program will more than likely render the hulk unsafe to undertake a long-term tow on the open ocean to the ship-breakers yards in mainland China or the Indian Sub-Continent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) There is always a market for scrap in any configuration and at any time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Equipment required by the Navy has been removed from the Derwent with some removed for sale and/or exhibit purposes by community groups. Sale of ships of this nature and demolition markets are basically confined to mainland China which is paying in the region of $US157&mdash;160 per light displacement ton delivered to the Shanghai area under its own power. Ships under 6000 tons light weight are basically not attractive and require payment of an import tariff of 6 percent. Prices quoted from the Indian Sub-Continent are somewhat higher at approximately $US 170&mdash;187 per light displacement ton dependent on type and time of delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an accepted fact that sales to China are on a more reliable cash basis in contrast to the Indian Sub-Continent which requires the sellers to negotiate on the basis of letters of credit payment after the ship has been beached at its point of delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the above quotes it is estimated that the Derwent would attract in the vicinity of $US 330K&mdash;350K in revenue if sold for scrap value less costs associated with this option, ie. delivery.</PARA>

These reports were examined and approved by both the Commonwealth and West Australian Environment Protection Authorities. The Navy has consulted with local, state and federal authorities at each stage of development of this plan. The experiments will be completed on 2 December 1994 and have been extremely successful, providing much valuable scientific data and very realistic training opportunities for the Navy fire-fighting and damage control teams.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) My Department has studied the Amnesty International report and noted its concerns about human rights in Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware of the debate over how to strengthen institutions to promote and protect human rights in the Territory. This debate should not obscure the fact that Hong Kong is one of the freest societies in the region, where the rule of law operates effectively.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government considers that adequate provision has been made to safeguard human rights in The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1 July 1997 under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which has international treaty status and has been registered with The United Nations. We consider that the two sovereign powers, which are signatories to the Joint Declaration, have an obligation to ensure that its provisions are fully implemented after the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997, including, in particular, the provisions guaranteeing independent judicial power, and rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief ensured by law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also hope that China will continue to report to the UN annually on human rights and civil liberties in Hong Kong, under the terms of the two human rights covenants, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which extend to Hong Kong, as mentioned in Annex One of the Joint Declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) China has declared its intention to dismantle the three-tier political structure in Hong Kong as it presently stands, having been modified through legislation passed by Hong Kong's Legislative Council in June this year, and to create an interim legislature in 1997 to ensure continuity in laws, to handle urgent business and to arrange elections for a permanent legislature. We hope that whatever arrangements are made for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are democratic and transparent and in accordance with the wishes and interests of the Hong Kong people. The spirit of the Joint Declaration and China's 1990 Basic Law in fact encourages building an even more accountable and representative government in Hong Kong over time. China has enshrined these guarantees in its own domestic laws regarding Hong Kong, i.e. the 1990 Basic Law.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. There are several instances where rural properties have been connected to the grid when renewable energy power supply systems would have been a cost effective alternative. This is particularly so where rural properties are far removed from the nearest grid lines and/or the electricity requirements of properties are small. For example, the University of New South Wales has estimated that, in many instances, renewable energy power supply systems could represent an economically viable alternative to grid connection for rural households faced with a grid connection cost of more than $15,000. Cost estimates of this nature underpin the Renewable Energy Promotion Program through which the Government has provided $3 million over the past three years to promote the use of commercially viable renewable energy technologies, particularly in rural and remote areas of Australia. Approximately 80 renewable energy displays which will be available for public inspection are being established throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am not aware of the context in which these specific statements were purported to have been made. However, I understand that they may relate to the launch of a book by journalist Gavin Gilchrist entitled "The Big Switch&mdash;clean energy for the twenty first century". The book contains considerable criticism of officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Examination of these criticisms (see, for example, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report on the Alternative Energy Seminar hosted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies on 28 September 1992) shows that these officers have been selectively quoted. This results in a misleading impression that these officers were not providing balanced advice on the prospects for using renewable energy technologies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Over the past decade, the US Federal and State Governments have undertaken major energy efficiency programs. They have also put in place regulations for electricity utilities to invest in energy efficiency through what is commonly known as demand side management (DSM) programs. Although the US has benefited economically from implementing many of these measures, recent studies suggest that several of the utility-DSM measures were far from economically viable on their own account. The results of these studies has led to a thorough re-examination of the cost effectiveness of DSM measures in the US, particularly compared with the cost-effectiveness and consequent benefits to the overall economy of government run energy-efficient programs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) The Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET), provides assistance for Aboriginal health worker accredited training in two ways. Through the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program (AESIP), DEET provided a total of $5,265,383 for the period 1990 to 1994. Assistance is also provided through its labour market programs. However, information on assistance provided under labour market programs is not </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">readily available and to collect and assemble the information required to answer the honourable Senator's question would be a major task. I am not prepared to authorise the resources involved in assembling this information solely for the purpose of answering the honourable Senator's question. (b) The breakdown of the AESIP funding for the period 1990 to 1994 is Queensland $1,437,203, Western Australia $330,444, Tasmania $15,000 and Northern Territory $3,482,736.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) ATSICHET has not received any funding for health worker training under AESIP. In late September 1994 ATSICHET submitted a proposal for funding of health worker training. That proposal did not set out the details of the assistance that ATSICHET was seeking from the Commonwealth and DEET has been undertaking discussions with ATSICHET in an attempt to finalise the details of their requirements. However, regardless of the outcomes of those discussions it will not be possible to provide supplementary AESIP funding for the 1995 academic year as all funds have been allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) Funding for training provided by the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory is provided from three sources: Vocational Education and Training assistance is provided to States and Territories through the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) which is responsible for the actual allocation. In 1994 gross funding from the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory, provided through ANTA, will total $9,990,455. Second, assistance may be provided under labour market programs. The allocation to DEET's Northern Australia Area for the training component of labour market programs in 1994/95 is $18,255,000. Third, assistance is provided through AESIP and the Northern Territory will receive $18,231,950 in 1994. (b) and (c) Allocation of ANTA funding to Batchelor College is a matter for the Northern Territory Education and Training Authority. Direct funding to Batchelor College that can be identified for the period 1990/91 until 1993/94 totals $240,435 under labour market programs. During the same period an amount of $3,482,736 under AESIP was paid as supplementary assistance to Batchelor College through the Northern Territory Department of Education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Information on the level of funding the Department provides directly to Aboriginal medical services for training purposes is not readily available. To collect and assemble the information required to answer the honourable Senator's question would be a major task. I am not prepared to authorise the resources involved in assembling this information solely for the purpose of answering the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
