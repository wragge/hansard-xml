<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1994 No 325, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 10 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New r.2B(3)(a) confers a discretion on the Commissioner which may have important implications for the operation of a business. The Committee asks whether there are any criteria in the Regulations for the exercise of the discretion and whether its exercise is subject to AAT review. If it is not subject to AAT review, the Committee would be grateful for your assurance that this is within the relevant guidelines of the Administrative Review Council and the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee earlier raised this issue in respect of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1989 No 277, following which the Committee was advised that the Regulations would be reviewed to consider whether AAT review should be provided.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 10 November 1994 concerning a discretion contained in new regulation 2B(3)(a) of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Regulations (Amendments), Statutory Rules 1994 No. 325. The Committee has asked whether there are any criteria in the Regulations for the exercise of this discretion and whether its exercise is subject to AAT review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New regulation 2B prescribes the level of professional indemnity insurance required of registered brokers and foreign insurance agents. It amalgamates two separate former regulations (3A and 10B) which set identical standards for these two types of intermediary. In amalgamating old regulations 3A(3)(a) and 10B(3)(a), new regulation 2B(3)(a) did not change their content or the Commissioner's discretion in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a concern that large excesses or deductibles in professional indemnity insurance policies can result in loss to members of the public dealing with insurance intermediaries. Old regulations 3A(3)(a) and 10B(3)(a) limited the deductible amount allowable for registered insurance intermediaries. However, they also allowed the Commissioner to administer the legislation with flexibility where this was justified by the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Insurance and Superannuation Commission publication&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Guide to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984</EMPHASIS>&mdash;has been issued to all registered brokers and foreign insurance agents. This makes clear that higher deductible amounts may be approved where an intermediary has adequate supporting capital, or a guarantee from a bank or other secure entity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner's discretion to approve deductibles is subject to sections 41 and 42 of the Act. Section 41 prevents the Commissioner from making an adverse decision affecting a person under this Act without giving that person notice of his or her right to be heard. Section 42 allows an application to be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for general review of decisions of the Commissioner under this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised by the ISC that the provisions were reviewed as a result of the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer's letter of 7 February 1990 to the Committee. The conclusion was reached that the general review provisions of section 42 apply to both the Act and to the Regulations. The legislation is therefore considered to provide protection for all persons subject to the Commissioner's discretionary powers in this area.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the following instruments considered by the Committee at its meeting of 10 November 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Citizen Band Radio Stations Class Licence made under s.132(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Handphone Stations (27 MHz) Class Licence made under s.132(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 8 of the former instrument and clause 7 of the latter provide for circumstances in which directions may be given relating to the operation of a station and set out the persons who may give such directions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circumstances are where there might be interference to radiocommunications which may endanger an aircraft or there are emergencies relating to the environment, risk of death or injury to persons or substantial damage to property. The persons who may give directions are police, Defence Force officers, officers of the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre and certain prescribed officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions appear appropriate and reasonable, but the Committee asks which provisions of the parent Act authorise the conferral of these powers to give directions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 10 November 1994 about the Citizen Band Radio Station (CBRS) and Handphone Stations (27 MHz) class licences that were made under s.132(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (the Act) and considered by the Committee at its meeting of 10 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has sought information about what provisions of the Act authorise the conferral of powers to give directions under clause 8 of the CBRS and clause 7 of the Handphone Stations (27 MHz) class licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can advise that the power to allow directions to be made under both clauses is conferred by s.133 of the Act. In particular, subsection 133(1) provides that "the SMA may include in a class licence such conditions as it thinks fit". Paragraph 6(b) of both licences makes it a condition that a person operating a CBRS or handphone station must comply with a direction given under the abovementioned clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The condition is identical to a condition imposed in individual apparatus licences issued under s.100 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust this information addresses the concerns of the Committee on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had reached the stage where I was suggesting that the government was wrong in rejecting our suggestion that there needs to be further avenues for review under this legislation. We are concerned that the lower chance of having a security assessment overturned is the reason for ASIO being asked to conduct fewer assessments in recent years. We would be interested to hear the minister's response to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter raised by the parliamentary joint committee was that injustices could arise because `the decision to refuse access, whether on the basis of security or general suitability grounds such as a character, is not in fact capable of judicial review'. The committee concluded that `the review process should be an effective one covering all relevant aspects of the process, including the actual decision'. This is consistent with the concerns of the Administrative Review Council, which, in its report to the Commonwealth government entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act: the ambit of the act</EMPHASIS> made this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Council's view, a distinction is properly drawn between the amenability to review security decisions as a class and the applicability of the grounds of review to a particular decision.</PARA>
<PARA>The ARC also recommended that certain provisions of schedule 1, including provisions relating to decisions under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 of the AD(JR) Act 1977, should be repealed. Yet the very same schedule is to apply to the new division of the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the Australian Democrats support the abolition of the Security Appeals Tribunal and the transfer of its functions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because of not only the possible cost savings but also the advantages in having a single tribunal system with uniform standards. Nonetheless, we believe that there are a number of flaws in the bill as presently drafted and as I have indicated. We therefore seek the referral of this bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a couple of further points to some of the other amendments in this bill. We are also concerned about the proposed changes to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. These amendments provide that if a provision of an act has an invalid application but also has at least one valid application, then, unless the contrary intention appears, `it is the parliament's intention that the provision is not to have the invalid application but is to have every valid application.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it may well be that the amendments are ultimately useful, we are always wary of the executive of the parliament attempting to fetter the powers of the judiciary. For this reason we believe it would be beneficial to have the Senate committee look at that provision as well. There are also some points to be made about the amendments proposed in this bill to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. The impetus for the reforms is contained in the 1991 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal</EMPHASIS>. This report has already provided the basis for reforms previously dealt with in an earlier law and justice legislation amendment bill. But we would be keen to examine this aspect of the bill in the context of the whole of the review process when it is considered by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are some amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. Certain of the changes give an arbitrator to whom a matter has been referred the power to apply to the court for leave to refer a question of law to the court. However, it has been suggested that these changes may be unduly restrictive and that the litigant should be able to make such an application personally in the same way that such applications are contemplated by the provisions of section 39 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 in Victoria which are mirrored in arbitration legislation throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, there is some concern that the proposed section 53AB of the act is different to and out of step with this uniform commercial arbitration legislation. The proposed legislation also gives an unfettered right of appeal from an arbitrator's award to a party to an award. The legislation  elsewhere in Australia does not give such a ride but allows an appeal either with the consent of all parties or the leave of the court. This can be seen in sections 38(2) and (4) of the Victorian act. Furthermore, the court cannot give such leave unless it is satisfied that there is a manifest error of law on the face of the award or that there is strong evidence that the arbitrator made an error of law and the question of law may add to the certainty of the commercial law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Uniformity of approach throughout Australia is considered to be desirable to prevent forum shopping, which can be a costly process. In addition, the curtailment of appeals from arbitrators is said to be desirable because it would reduce the overall legislation and cost of litigation. This factor will need to be considered in the deliberations of the committee. We welcome the bill and look forward to scrutinising the bill within the framework of the referral to the Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not traverse the ground already covered by Senators Vanstone and Spindler, who have set out the purpose of the bill and its general application. There are, however, two matters that cause me concern. I am pleased to hear that this bill will be going before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter that causes me some concern is the amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act. Section 15 AAA, in particular, is what I refer to. I note that the explanatory memorandum states that in some recent cases the High Court has found the invalid application of Commonwealth law and has struck down various provisions. I will refer briefly to those two cases. There was a migration case commonly known as the Lim case reported in (1992) 176 CLR 1. That related to a provision which dealt with the imprisonment of boat people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section in question prohibited a court from releasing a designated person from custody. The High Court held that, as the section could apply to a person who was not in lawful custody as well as a person who was in lawful custody, it derogated from the court's powers to order the release and it was therefore invalid. The section, it would seem, applied to people who were lawfully imprisoned and people who were unlawfully imprisoned; it had a dual application. Because one of those applications was invalid, the provision was struck down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in Nationwide News, a case reported in 1992 177 CLR 1, a provision of the Industrial Relations Act made it an offence to use words which were calculated to bring a member of the Industrial Relations Commission into disrepute. The section applied to someone calling an industrial relations commissioner names, if you like&mdash;abusing the person&mdash;and also defaming the person. There were two aspects to it. As I understand the case, the law as such cut across the laws of defamation, which were not within the Commonwealth's ambit of legislative power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section had two applications. Accordingly, the court ruled that where you have two applications, one being invalid, the provision is struck down.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply put, the situation is that if you have a law which supposedly deals with apples and, in the process, it touches on pears, and the Commonwealth does not have the power to deal with pears, the High Court strikes down the provision because it says, `It could deal with apples or it could deal with pears. It is not supposed to deal with pears.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Acts Interpretation Act is an act which is there to assist us in looking at Commonwealth law, to assist us in understanding federal legislation. I noted with some amusement the heading under the Acts Interpretation Act. It states, `An Act for the Interpretation of Acts of Parliament and for Shortening their Language'. I think section 15AAA proposed by the government really does not hold true to that principle; in fact, nor does the very act itself. It is quite amusing that there is this purpose at the head of the Acts Interpretation Act. I have yet to see the intention of shortening the language of the legislation. I think I will be a very old man before I see that happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal gives parliament a bit of a two-way bet. This is my understanding of it, and I am open to correction. This is why I think it is a very good idea to refer it to the Senate's committee on legal and constitutional affairs. The proposal seems to allow sloppier drafting to slip through the net. If the law has two applications&mdash;if it applies to apples and pears&mdash;it would seem that the provision is allowable in so far as it applies or has valid application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it applies validly to apples and also touches on pears, this new proposal seems to say, `Forget the fact that it touches on pears; that is not right. But it is still okay for the apples.' The previous situation seemed to be that, if it touched on pears and apples and pears were not allowed, it was struck down entirely. So it allows it to slip through the net, so to speak. I think it really does widen the application of Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, that is an undesirable thing to have in legislation. If you legislate for something, it should touch on only that. If it touches on anything else which is invalid, beyond the powers of the parliament, I believe it should be struck down. That is a view I hold at the moment. I am open to advice, which no doubt we will receive via the evidence given to the committee. I believe there should be some accountability, if I can put it that way, in the drafting of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a federal system. The Commonwealth is allowed to legislate on only certain matters. The states legislate on other matters. If the Commonwealth steps over that bound and touches on areas where it is not allowed to transgress, where it is not allowed to go, that legislation should be struck down. I think this could really open the floodgates. I am not so sure that current section 15A is insufficient. I think it is an adequate provision and there is not a case to be made out by the government for the introduction of this new proposal. The two cases I mentioned, Lim and Nationwide News, do not illustrate the point well enough for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point which is not of such great moment is the amendment to the Federal Court of Australia Act which is found in clause 35 of schedule 2 of the bill. Proposed sections 53AA and 53AB allow for an arbitrator in a hearing to refer proceedings to the Federal Court with the consent of the parties. The Law Council of Australia had some concern about this. An individual should be able to make application direct to have a matter of law referred to the Federal Court. If a question arises in such proceedings, it should not be so hamstrung that the arbitrator refers the problem&mdash;if we can call it that&mdash;to the Federal Court only with the consent of the parties. It might not be in the interests of one party to agree. It might not want it referred. The other party who has the argument might want it referred. I think it should always be available in proceedings for either party, the plaintiff or the defendant, to be able to air their argument fully and not be stymied from going any further. I think in this particular case this provision does that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I am open to the advice that no doubt we will receive via the evidence given to us. I await with interest to see the evidence of the Attorney-General. But for the time being I think this proposal is not a good one. It does not enjoy my support. Perhaps I misunderstood the operation of this proposed amendment, but it seems fairly clear that an individual cannot refer a matter to the Federal Court in such proceedings, it has to go via the arbitrator and it has to be done by consent. That is not a desirable situation. The bill otherwise has some commendable aspects to it. Those aspects have been touched on more than adequately by Senator Vanstone and Senator Spindler. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some general comments about the Criminal Code Bill and the Crimes Amendment Bill, which were also handled on a cognate basis in the committee inquiry. The two bills went through quite an extensive consultation process and are the result of the work of two committees outside parliament. The first committee was the Gibbs committee, chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, which published a report in July 1990 dealing with principles of criminal responsibility. The second report was produced by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, which was established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in June 1990. A significant feature of these two bills is that they are intended to establish a criminal code which is uniform throughout Australia and that they are the product of consultation between the state Attorneys-General as well as with the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular provision I would like to address is the so-called Majewski issue. In developing the provision in section 426 that evidence of self-induced intoxication cannot be considered in determining whether the conduct was voluntary, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General decided to follow the UK decision in Majewski (1977) AC 480 that evidence of intoxication can be used to deny intention or recklessness in offences of specific intent, such as murder, but cannot be used as an excuse in relation to simple offences of basic intent, such as assault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section, which is now being passed in the bills before the Senate, would place the Commonwealth in line with the law in England, Canada, the United States, Queensland, WA, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. However, it alters the common law in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT, where gross intoxication may be taken into account in relation to all offences as a result of the High Court's decision in O'Connor in 1980. This is one of the provisions of the bills which was very carefully examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. While we express some concern about the change in the law, the Australian Democrats have decided to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other issues which equally were discussed by the Senate standing committee. Some of them are in the area of conspiracy. That issue arose under both bills and each requires an agreement to commit an offence as well as an overt act taken pursuant to that agreement. The Director of Public Prosecutions objected to the inclusion of the overt act  requirement and argued that in some instances&mdash;for example, a murder&mdash;all the planning may have been done and the only remaining act could be the offence itself. However, as the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties argued, the inclusion of the overt act requirement ensures that the law properly distinguishes between tentative talk which might be constituted into an illegal agreement and something that was in fact serious. The Australian Democrats once again support that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One provision that caused us considerable concern during the committee's inquiry was the requirement that people can be held to have withdrawn from a conspiracy if they have taken all reasonable steps to prevent the offence which is the subject of the conspiracy to proceed. That may well be interpreted to mean that they should be obliged to inform the authorities of the planned operation and this could in fact act as a disincentive to withdrawal. We would have been happier if the bill had not used the word `all'. We would have preferred to have seen that struck out. Once again, bearing in mind that the bill is the result of thorough consultation between the states and the Commonwealth, the Democrats have decided not to seek an amendment to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I briefly state that the Democrats support strongly the provisions on corporate criminal responsibility. While some concerns were expressed about those sections before the committee, we believe that these provisions are an advance in Australian criminal law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Spindler pointed out, the Criminal Code Bill and the Crimes Amendment Bill are intended to bring about a federal criminal code. Common law operates in New South Wales and Victoria and a criminal code operates in Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. These bills have sought to merge the two so that there is uniform criminal law throughout the Commonwealth. In the first instance this code will apply only to federal offences, but it is anticipated that the states will follow and introduce similar legislation so that there is uniform criminal law throughout the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the age of criminal responsibility varies throughout Australia. In Tasmania it is the age of seven, in the ACT it is the age of eight, and elsewhere it is the age of 10. The example given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee was that of a seven-year-old child from New South Wales being able to be convicted of a federal offence committed while on holiday in Tasmania when the same act committed at home would result in no charge. It is this sort of inconsistency that the code seeks to remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be a good deal of support for a national criminal code. It is anticipated that this will not come about for another five years. I think that is the time frame the government is looking at. I urge the government to introduce this law carefully and err on the side of caution rather than of haste because we are dealing with perhaps the most important legislation which could come through this and the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criminal law goes directly to sanctioning the behaviour of the citizens of the country. It involves serious penalties and the deprivation of liberty. Apart from the death penalty, there is nothing greater than that. So we have to be very careful when we look at how we judge people to be guilty of an offence and what sorts of acts will constitute an offence at law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally, criminal offences are looked at in Latin terms of actus reus and mens rea; that is, the act that is done and the intention that goes with it. For instance, I could throw a piece of wood into a crowd. I might not intend to hurt anybody but, nonetheless, that act is a dangerous one. The law looks at that and says that if I intended to hurt someone I am guilty of perhaps a more serious offence. In fact, if I killed someone I would be guilty of wilful murder. If, however, I just threw it recklessly that could be a lesser charge. I would still be guilty of an offence but guilty of manslaughter or murder. The criminal law looks at the act that is done and the intention that follows the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular legislation, the terms `physical elements' and `fault elements' are used. I think there is going to be some trouble in getting this across to both the legal profession and the public at large. It was Her Honour Judge Yeats from the District Court of Western Australia who really drew the committee's attention to the drafting of the bill. She said that physical element and fault element were perhaps unfortunate choices and were not to be preferred to the current terminology&mdash;words like `fact', `act' or `omission'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that the government have a look at the drafting of the criminal codes. The Griffiths code is an exceptional piece of legislation. Although it was drafted at the time of Federation, the words are still capable of simple understanding. As Her Honour Judge Yeats said, the use of a word such as `fact' or `act' are words that anyone can understand. But once you say to people, `In judging whether you are guilty we have to look at the physical element and the fault element,' it gets a bit nebulous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her Honour Judge Yeats said, `I have to face juries and explain to juries what the law means.' She concluded that a criminal code should be usable by juries as well as by  lawyers and that drafting in any way that can result in a misunderstanding is very serious. She said in her evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I could probably, after some study, grasp this legislation, but my job is not to simply grasp the law but to explain it to a jury, and that is the point where the simpler the language and the simpler the concepts, the more usable the code will be . . . The language that is used has taken it out of the realm of being usable with juries, and that is a serious, serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA>What Her Honour was saying was that the wording would make it difficult for judges to put this legislation to juries, which consist of men and women chosen at random. I believe that is a concern. I would ask the government to be ever mindful of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the move for such a national code. In the committee's report&mdash;I refer to page 34&mdash;there were some drafting aspects of the bill which the committee put to the government. I ask the government what it thought of those proposals in relation to the specific drafting issues at page 34 and 35 of the committee report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is such a complex area that in the remaining eight minutes of my speaking time I could not attempt to cover adequately the issues concerned. Senator Spindler raised some issues which I share. But my main concern is that if you are going to have legislation of this importance you keep the language as simple as possible, and the Griffiths code is a very good example of such simple language. At the end of the day, this legislation is going to have to be understood by a jury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be a jury that the judge explains this legislation to and says, `A person is guilty of conspiracy or intoxication if these circumstances apply.' Intoxication, for instance, as Senator Spindler touched on, can affect culpability in this way. The judge then perhaps reads the section from the legislation to the jury, and if that section is too complex, if that section is not capable of being simply understood, then juries are going to have a difficult time getting their minds around the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is my main concern with the proposed legislation. It is introducing new terminology. Hitherto we have dealt with very simple words, very simple concepts. `Beyond a reasonable doubt' is a concept which I believe most men and women understand. They have heard it enough and they know it applies to the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, when you say to someone, `If you commit an act which results in death, then in certain circumstances you can be guilty,' that is very simple; anyone can understand that. When you bring in notions of fault elements and physical elements, it then gets quite unclear. That is my difficulty with the proposed legislation. But, as I say, this is commendable legislation, and I hope that the government takes on board the committee's recommendations. </PARA>

But the report says that in each area and most if not all other areas where concerns are raised there is a decision to be made involving a compromise.

The issue is whether that purpose&mdash;that is, the obtaining or provision of legal advice&mdash;is the sole purpose or the dominant purpose of the communication or document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the sole purpose test. The New South Wales bill provides for the dominant purpose test, which is more generous to the party seeking to claim the privilege. The common law sole purpose test was laid down by the High Court in the case of Grant v. Downs. In a subsequent consideration by the High Court in Waterford v. the Commonwealth, the impact of the test was diluted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question of interpretation whether the High Court in that case actually resiled from the sole purpose test. As I understand it, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is of the view that the sole purpose test represents the current common law position and should be incorporated in this bill. After significant consideration of the issue the Australian Law Reform Commission concluded that the sole purpose test was not workable and endorsed a dominant purpose test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing that agreement was unable to be reached in relation to this matter for the purpose of determining legal professional privilege. It appears that the sticking point was with the minister, who apparently has a very close interest in this particular aspect of the bill. He has stuck to his view that the sole purpose test is appropriate, at the expense, I might say, of consistency, and despite the recommendations of Australian Law Reform Commission. The result is that the High Court will be required to adjudicate on two different standards. The states, when contemplating the adoption of the model law, will be able to choose which standard to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of the minister to accede to the more widely accepted view shows a stubbornness that belies his claims for consistency elsewhere. The dominant purpose test is to be preferred, particularly given that the Law Reform Commission has endorsed the dominant purpose test and that the adoption of that test would result in consistency with the New South Wales bill. Accordingly, I foreshadow that we will be moving amendments to the Evidence Bill at the committee stage. </PARA>

He saw the importance of this legislation and worked long and hard to see it get to the point it is at now. I know it is of great joy to him that this bill is about to be passed. It is proper that someone in this chamber, in this parliament and in this country acknowledges the work that he has put into this legislation. </PARA>

It is particularly relevant in criminal trials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A look through this bill shows that all those issues were addressed. A look at the law of evidence, which took many centuries to develop, shows that it is about that.

A major part of the dispute depends upon the state of the forests and what damage is or is not being done. That is very much an evidentiary issue. If the rules of evidence could be applied to the situation that prevails and the facts about what is going on in the forests could be established, a lot of heat would go out of the argument. That is an illustration of how the establishment of truth is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I want to raise before I sit down is this: the rules of evidence at times prevent the truth coming out in court. Facts that may be able to be established by a particular means are not established because of the rules of evidence. People say, `Isn't this ridiculous. The truth is frustrated by these rules of evidence.' That is a wrong analysis. Truth should not be gained at the sacrifice of fairness and justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote something that I have quoted in here before; it needs quoting again and again. It is a quote from a decision by the Vice-Chancellor Sir Knight Bruce in 1846, which is almost 150 years ago, in a case called Pearse v Pearse. It was a civil case, not a criminal case. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination, nor probably would the purpose of the mere disclosure of truth have been otherwise than advanced by a refusal on the part of the Lord Chancellor in 1815 to act against the solicitor, who, in the cause between Lord Cholmondeley and Lord Clinton, had acted or proposed to act in the manner which Lord Eldon thought it right to prohibit. Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely&mdash;may be pursued too keenly&mdash;may cost too much. And surely the meanness and the mischief of prying into a man's confidential consultations with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness, and suspicion and fear, into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a great statement to remember in a period when the forces of law and order seem intent on overriding those great and traditional principles that have been inherent in the law for so long.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats welcome the Evidence Bill 1994. Before I outline our position on it I would like to pay tribute to the speech just made by Senator Cooney. I pay tribute to his role as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which he has chaired with great emphasis on the principles he has just outlined. It is important, as Senator Cooney said, in this age where economic rationalism is pushing us into adopting financial judgments and applying the financial slide rule to many decisions, that we protect the civil liberties and the freedoms of Australian citizens. I commend him for those statements and associate myself with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is an important tool not just for lawyers but for the people of Australia. The aims of the bill are threefold: firstly, to provide a consistent system of evidence law for use in the Federal Court; secondly, to modernise and simplify what are in many ways excessively complex and outdated rules; and, thirdly, to establish the basis for what may eventually become a uniform code of evidence that will apply throughout all Australian jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of reform in this area began in November 1977 when the Senate's legal and constitutional committee recommended that `a review of the whole of evidence law should be undertaken by the Law Reform Commission with a view to producing a wholly comprehensive code of evidence based on concepts appropriate to the present day.' In 1987 the Law Reform Commission duly reported and four years later the governments of both New South Wales and the Commonwealth introduced evidence bills into their respective parliaments based largely on the Law Reform Commission's proposals. Eventually it was agreed that the New South Wales and Commonwealth bills would form the basis of a uniform law. This bill represents the Commonwealth contribution to the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay tribute to Justice Smith and his role in bringing this process to fruition and to the present bill. He has been, as Senator Cooney said, extremely diligent and extremely forceful over the years to move the process ahead. I am sure he would be delighted that we have reached this stage. The case for an overhaul of the law of evidence was summed up in one submission to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee when Professor Mark Aronson observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent times the High Court had had to deliver judgment in three cases on the meaning of the hearsay rule, 10 cases on the meaning of and application of the similar facts rule, 12 cases on the complexities of corroboration law, and 17 cases on police evidence of an accused's confession.</PARA>
<PARA>Presently there is also the unsatisfactory situation whereby Commonwealth laws are interpreted subject to the different laws of evidence in different state jurisdictions. Although one would hope that it is extremely unlikely, it is therefore conceivable that a person could be convicted of a Commonwealth offence in one state but would not have been convicted had they been tried in another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some of the substantive features of the bill. Firstly, I wish to address the dominant purpose test as against the sole purpose test in the area of legal professional privilege, which is one of the main issues in contention and which was dealt with in some detail in the committee's deliberations. Currently the draft bill provides in clauses 118, 119 and 120 that, if a client of a lawyer or an unrepresented party objects, evidence cannot be given that would disclose confidential information that was brought into existence for the sole purpose of providing legal advice or for use in litigation. The rationale for the rule is that it encourages freedom of consultation between clients of lawyers and their legal advisers, or unrepresented parties and their advisers, and does not act as a disincentive for persons contemplating litigation to produce documents for use in that litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competing policy objective is that the court should not be restricted in terms of the documents it may call before it. This is obviously the position that the government has adopted. However, there is a serious weakness, I would submit, in the sole purpose test in so far as it is difficult to apply literally without destroying the client's privilege. As Mr Justice Smith explained to the Senate committee, a solicitor's file comes into existence not only for the purpose of giving legal advice; it is also used by the solicitor as a record of work done in part for the purpose of charging the client. The Australian Law Reform Commission also concluded after extensive consultation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sole purpose test was not workable. There was a universal acceptance of the dominant purpose test as a test that struck the appropriate balance.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats will therefore be supporting the use of the dominant purpose test rather than the sole purpose test with respect to clauses 118, 119 and 120. In other words, we will be supporting the coalition's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will also be proposing a number of amendments during the committee stage. I will briefly outline those now. They were in fact tabled in the committee's interim report in June 1994, where we gave notice of these amendments after considerable consultation with the minister's office. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the Democrat amendments is to ensure that police officers would be able to give evidence in chief on behalf of the prosecution by reading into evidence a prior written statement only where the defence consents to this approach. This amendment adopted a proposal put before the committee by the Australian Council for Civil Liberties and one that was adopted by Mr justice Smith. The minister responded by noting that the defence would generally refuse to consent to the police reading into evidence the prior written statement and that the prosecution would see no benefit in serving the statement on the defence if the police officer could not then use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the main benefit of this amendment is to facilitate the provision of routine evidence by police officers. Where that evidence is not routine&mdash;for example, identification evidence&mdash;the defence should have the right to require that the evidence be given in full. Further, the minister's reasoning ignores the fact that the police will still be able to use the statement to refresh their memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and third amendments would provide that a witness cannot be required by a court to give evidence that incriminates that witness where, as a result, harm might be caused or there was a likelihood that the evidence would be unreliable. The minister's response to that is that these amendments appear to impose conflicting obligations on the court and place those who might give self-incriminating testimony in a more privileged position than other witnesses. However, the bill at present simply refers to the test of the interests of justice. This test was felt, even by judges, to be vague and arbitrary in its application. The Democrat amendments simply provide the court with better guidance and with some criteria for the application of the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth amendment would ensure that both gay and heterosexual couples are covered by the definition of `de facto spouse'. The minister seems to suggest that this would create a legal status similar to marriage. However, what the amendment seeks to produce is equality between homosexual and heterosexual de facto couples. I believe this is a principle that should be included in all legislation that comes before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth amendment we are proposing relates to the definition of `parent' and includes in the definition `the person with whom the child is living as if the child were a member of the person's family'. We understand that this amendment may gain the support of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to advert to a number of criticisms of the bill made by outside bodies which have so far not been addressed by the government. For instance, the Law Society of New South Wales argued before the committee, firstly, that improperly obtained evidence should be automatically inadmissible rather than the court having a discretion to exclude evidence and, secondly, that the bill should include a provision making it mandatory that an interpreter be provided for an accused person who is not sufficiently conversant in English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I lend strong support to the second of these recommendations, while leaving the first one open as to its value and urgency. I have written to the Attorney-General asking for his response to both of those points but, as of this morning, I had not received a response from the Attorney-General's office. I rather regret that because, as I said, in particular the provision which I think would be one of simple justice&mdash;that is, that an interpreter be provided on a mandatory basis where a person is not sufficiently conversant in English to follow proceedings&mdash;I would have thought the government should have considered favourably and urgently. </PARA>

I compliment the work done by the secretariat and my colleagues on that committee and the chairmanship of Senator Cooney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee produced an interim report on the Evidence Bill. It raised in that interim report some 38 concerns touching on a variety of matters. By way of example, one issue which concerned me was whether clause 20, which permits comment on failure to give evidence on behalf of the defence, really destroyed the right to silence and whether it effectively cast a reverse onus of proof on the accused by causing the accused to have to call or give evidence. That was just one of the concerns. The others were perhaps of a lesser nature. I single out that one as an example of some of the issues that were raised by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that interim report, the Federal Government liaised with the New South Wales government, which is introducing a similar bill. The committee also recommended, in addition to this liaison between the two governments, that there be a period of at least six months between the passing of the bill and its coming into operation to enable the legal community to familiarise itself with the bill's operation. I am pleased to note that originally this was to come into operation on 1 January this year and that the government has replaced that with 18 April this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the government agrees in principle with the recommendation made by the committee that there be a panel to monitor this legislation and that the panel comprise representatives of the relevant courts, legal practitioners and the Attorney-General's Department. I cannot stress enough the importance of such monitoring of this proposed legislation and that, furthermore, such monitoring should be the subject of examination in the future by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a most important piece of legislation. I know I said that about the Criminal Code Bill that we dealt with earlier this morning, but when you combine the Evidence Bill with the Criminal Code Bill you really cover the ambit of criminal law and law enforcement where the state says to an individual, `You are guilty and you will be punished. The full force of the law will be visited upon you.' So how you deal with evidence in a criminal matter, where the individual is innocent until proven guilty by the state, is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, this bill applies to civil actions. When citizens take each other to court, they should be able to rely on the judicial process as being fair, an orderly and proper process whereby they can seek a remedy. The rules of evidence are precisely the machinery of the courts. How the courts deal with evidence is absolutely crucial. Frequent concern is being expressed at present about the way in which evidence is treated. You do not have to look any further than the O. J. Simpson trial in the United States, where there has been much argument over what the prosecution has done with evidence. After all, evidence is what is used or relied upon in making a determination when the court comes to try an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is extremely important. The regulation of how we treat facts and articles, which can give rise to a verdict of guilt, is extremely important. There was a feeling that there should be a codification of the laws of evidence for the Commonwealth and that in due course the states would follow suit. With the passage of this bill and the New South Wales legislation, there will be great uniformity between the state of New South Wales and the Commonwealth in the federal jurisdiction. I think that is no bad thing and is desirable. Nonetheless, a subject like this must be approached with caution and care, and should be monitored. I know the government agrees in principle with the committee's suggestion, but I cannot stress enough how important that is because this legislation is innovative and is breaking new ground. Over the years we have</PARA>
<PARA>relied on common law to build up rules as to how the courts try issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such rule that has been built up over the years is hearsay. It is a simple thing. Somebody who goes to court cannot give evidence of what another person has said because, quite obviously, that could give rise to grave injustice. If I went into the witness box and said, `I know that to be a fact because someone told me it was a fact,' that would be a very shaky foundation on which to base any conclusion about my day-to-day dealings with my fellow citizens. So over the years the common law built up the rule against hearsay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules of evidence have been built up and distilled through the affairs of human beings over hundreds of years. This bill attempts to codify the law of evidence for the Commonwealth. I know that it has been denied in some circumstances that this is a code, but I must say that it does purport to cover greatly the area of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address in particular the amendment proposed by Senator Vanstone, and I applaud it. It deals with the sole purpose test for legal privilege. I must say that it has been another principle which has developed over the years. If someone goes to see their lawyer, they can do so without fear or favour. They can do so in full confidence, knowing that what they say to their lawyer is privileged. What they say to their lawyer is between themselves and their lawyer. That is an essential principle in the administration of justice in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a system of natural justice where someone is allowed to be represented. It is a right. Accompanying that right is the right to have your communications with your lawyer privileged. You do not have to incriminate yourself in a prosecution. You do not have to put yourself over the barrel, so to speak; you can simply say nothing, and that is your right to silence. But if you do say anything, it will be used in evidence against you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conducting your defence, you should have the ability to seek legal advice in a privileged and confidential environment so that you can then make your decision whether you wish to say anything or whether you wish to maintain your right to silence, or how you conduct your defence generally. It would be a grave injustice if the state were able to trample upon that right to privilege. Quite frankly, the sole purpose test is insufficient to protect this great principle that is so basic to our legal system. The committee's report stated that the traditional rationale for privilege is said to be that it promotes the better administration of justice. I believe it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the sole purpose test is that it is too restrictive. It says that something is privileged if the communication is given for the sole purpose of legal advice or for communication between a client and lawyer. That means that the communication must be just for that purpose and nothing else. That is too restrictive because, in some instances, you might be consulting with your lawyer and, in the course of that communication, something else is involved&mdash;some extraneous matter&mdash;but it is still tied up with your communication, which is privileged. The sole purpose test could result in that communication then being open to inspection because it could be said that that was not really the sole purpose of the communication. The sole purpose was not just for legal advice; there was this other extraneous matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the dominant purpose test is the best one. That test asks: was the dominant purpose of your communication with your lawyer for legal advice on the matter? If the dominant purpose was, then it should be protected. So if there is some extraneous matter involved, then so be it; but as long as the dominant aspect of your communication is for the purpose of legal advice, then it should be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His Honour Mr Justice Smith, who worked so hard on this legislation, I might add&mdash;I commend him for his work&mdash;said that the dominant purpose test would be a better one to be applied. That view was supported by the Law Society of New South Wales and the Australian Law Reform Commission. I think that really does sum it up. With those bodies supporting it, you really do not go much further than that. I think Senator Vanstone's amendment is a laudable one and I will be supporting it at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it is essential that the legal community comes to terms with the evidence bills as soon as possible. It will be a great change for the practice of law in this country and I urge the government to do everything possible to alert the legal community as to this impending change and to alert the community at large also. Right now there are millions of Australians going about their daily business and none of them would realise that the laws of evidence are about to be encapsulated in these bills&mdash;nor would they really care, I suppose, until they have cause to go to court or unless they are prosecuted by the state. Nonetheless, I do believe that the dissemination of knowledge on this aspect is indeed very important. It strikes at the basic rights of citizenship; that is, how a citizen is tried in a court of law. You cannot get anything more important than that. </PARA>

I say on behalf of the government that we appreciate their effort and acknowledge it as significant.

In other words, if the sentence read `the person with whom a child is living' rather than `the person with whom the child is living', the government would accept it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things I should comment on is that I caught in the remarks of Senator Spindler a reference to the need for the provision of interpreters. I understood the position he was putting to be a quite reasonable one, that if a person in a court has a need for interpretation then interpretation should be supplied. Section 30 of the Evidence Bill is headed `Interpreters' and reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A witness may give evidence about a fact through an interpreter unless the witness can understand and speak the English language sufficiently to enable the witness to understand, and to make an adequate reply to, questions that may be put about the fact.</PARA>
<PARA>Our understanding of that clause is that it meets the concern that Senator Spindler has raised, that in the event of a witness requiring an interpreter, an interpreter would be available. I make that observation since Senator Spindler raised this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is probably best that anything I might say about the coalition's foreshadowed amendment to be moved by Senator Vanstone be confined to the committee stage, it would be wrong of me to not acknowledge the considered observations of Senator Ellison on this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So you do admit that this bill compels a husband to give evidence against his wife, to divulge confidence in the marital state to the court. That is what it does. I am not alone in my objection to this. I refer to a letter that was received by me from the Law Society of New South Wales. I will read the relevant part to the committee:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2: Compellability of spouses and others in criminal proceedings. Clause 18, New South Wales clause 17, permits the court to override the objection of a spouse, a de facto spouse, a parent or child of a defendant and compel that person to give evidence against the accused unless there is a likelihood of harm being caused to the person or the relationship between the person and the defendant and the nature of the harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given.</PARA>
<PARA>The Law Society submits that the special relationship which exists between spouses and de facto spouses is such that except for the exceptions contained in clause 19, which is New South Wales clause 18, no spouse or de facto spouse of a defendant should ever be compelled to give evidence against the defendant. The confidentiality and trust that exists between spouses and de facto spouses should only be eroded in exceptional circumstances such as in domestic violence or child abuse, as is contained in clause 19 and New South Wales clause 18. So the Law Society is also very concerned about this obviously because of its importance in the administration of justice and fairness in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very uneasy about this matter. I believe the Senate has the responsibility and, indeed, the obligation to uphold the rights of individuals within the community. Here is our opportunity to uphold the rights of the individual. Here is our opportunity to reinforce the principle that marriage should enjoy the favour of the law. If the Senate goes ahead with this, in my view it will be doing so in contradiction of those two major principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the amendment to the Senate. The amendment states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has raised an extremely important issue. He did raise it, as he said, before the committee so the government and everyone concerned had plenty of notice of the issue that he would raise. We have given it long and hard consideration. The distinction here is not about spouses having absolutely no protection in court proceedings for their communications but whether it is absolute protection, absolute privilege or qualified privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding by a whisker not to support Senator Harradine's amendments, we have given careful consideration to clause 18 and to the various factors that the court must take into consideration when it decides whether or not spousal communication should have protection. It may be useful to read some of those into the record. First of all, the person must have been aware of the communication and the court must hear and determine any objection to that communication being heard in court in the absence of a jury. So there is some protection in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court must take into account in making its decision whether there is a likelihood that harm would or might be caused, whether directly or indirectly, to the person or&mdash;and I feel that is an important qualification&mdash;to the relationship between the person and the defendant. I believe that gives some protection to the marriage relationship if the person is to give that particular evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the court must take into account the following: the nature and gravity of the offence; the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it; whether any other evidence concerning the matters is reasonably available to the prosecutor&mdash;the implication being if that evidence can be obtained in other ways then clearly it would not be thought fair for the court to compel it from a spouse; the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person; and whether in giving the evidence the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be very cooperative if you do not wish to move it. In Victoria and South Australia a spouse of the accused is compellable in a criminal trial but enjoys a discretionary privilege in terms very similar to those proposed by the bill. In both states a court has a discretion to exempt such a spouse from giving evidence for the prosecution where there is a likelihood of damage or harm to his or her relationship with the accused. A court is required in both states to balance that likelihood against the importance of obtaining the spouse's evidence in a particular trial. Where a spouse cannot be compelled to give evidence, he or she of course can refuse to give evidence regardless of the state of his or her relationship with the accused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine, in his remarks, talked about `informers'. He used that term, which is an emotive one. I state very firmly on behalf of the government that this bill does not compel anyone to become an informer. It is only concerned with the giving of evidence in court proceedings. It is up to individuals themselves, including spouses of persons engaged in criminal activity, whether they provide information to investigative agencies. We very strongly refute any suggestion that this bill compels anybody to become an informer. Particularly in Australia there has always been some cultural aversion to the nature of the term `informer'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe clause 18 in particular provides a balanced test for dealing with evidence by spouses. It was recommended by the Law Reform Commission, and it enables the court to take into account the actual state of the relationship between spouses. We believe the amendments moved by Senator Harradine are too inflexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seeing Senator Harradine is still making up his mind about whether he will move amendment 3, I conclude by mentioning other remarks Senator Harradine made. He quite rightly talked about the interest in this chamber in human rights. Many senators on all sides of the chamber have had a long interest in human rights, which is only an appropriate course. Senator Harradine gave the impression that, if this bill is carried without his amendments, situations would then apply in Australia as would apply in other countries that have a long history of unfortunate human rights abuses. I refute that very strongly. I think the due processes this country has in favour of the individual in legal proceedings overwhelmingly would prevent that and diminish the concerns that he raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that I, like you, Senator Harradine, have served on the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of this parliament, have made reports and have shown a particular interest. I do not deny the fact that you have raised in this chamber issues involving human rights abuses in many facets in many other countries. But I also emphasise to you that it is drawing a very long bow to suggest that this bill would in any way align Australia with the situations that now apply unfortunately in those other countries. You know as well as I do those other countries which you mentioned do not have the established due processes of the law that we have in this country and, above all else, do not have the cultural history that this country has. The right of the individual in all aspects of human rights and legal rights is so well established that no one piece of legislation can take away the rights of people to have due process and be legally protected from unfair actions by the state or by agencies. So we reject your amendments and ask the chamber to reject them as well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now only two states that have provisions such as these. The common law and most legislatures have traditionally provided that a spouse is either not a competent witness or not a compellable witness against a person. For example, under the imperial criminal Evidence Act 1898 the wife or husband of the accused could not be called as a witness except upon the accused's application. Statutory exceptions to this principle have arisen. We have the statutory exceptions to the principle and they are contained in clause 19 of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just remind the minister and the chamber that, in contrast, he talked about the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. A lot of things are done for uniformity's sake without the implications being looked at. In contrast to the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, I prefer the view enunciated in the 1963 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Phipson on Evidence</EMPHASIS> that spouses should not be compellable and marital communications protected `in order to ensure that unlimited confidence between husband and wife upon which happiness of human life and peace of families depend'. That is quaint language, but it is still relevant now. What I believe you are doing&mdash;and I will not say anything more on this because, obviously, I do not have the numbers; but I think I will be proved right, unfortunately&mdash;is undermining the very important principles that marriage should enjoy the favours of the law and that marital communications should not be made to be compellable evidence. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want you to respond to why you think it is enough. From discussions held earlier this morning I am advised that the department is of the view that the profession likes to get a lot of its cases out of the way by the middle of the year and so the best guess for the best break is Easter rather than the Queen's birthday long weekend. That may be true, but I give an example of where things done too quickly without adequate advice to the profession can cost people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example, which I think is a good analogy, is that of the launch yesterday of a new divorce application kit. There is a new form to be used by unrepresented and represented clients. It is a sort of tick-a-box form. The suggestion is that the form is going to be much simpler. If it turns out to be that way, we obviously welcome it. The production of this kit, I think, is one of the first signs that the work of the family law committee, promoted by Senator Brownhill and worked on by Senator Reid, Senator Spindler and others in the other place, is starting to bear fruit. I approve of easier and simpler forms. I approve of forms for Family Court or any other court users that mean people can use them without having to go and pay solicitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not in any way want to criticise the introduction of the form itself. I go to the timing, however. The profession in my state got letters dated 15 or 16 January stating that on 1 February the family law court would be changing its divorce application form and they were provided with the new one. The letter was kind enough to say that forms produced by law stationers or ones that complied appropriately could be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here is the trick. The family law court has had its wordprocessing or database system changed. You may have filled in an old form. You may be from the country; a lot of people live in regional Australia. Not many people go and get a divorce application, fill it out and file it. They go away and think about it. It is a big step; it is an end to the marriage they thought was going to be wonderful. You may have got the form two weeks ago and you go back today as an unrepresented client and find the court saying that it cannot take it. Why can it not take it? Because it has had its computer system changed and now it needs the tick-a-box form. The old form will not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is significant cost to any number of unrepresented clients who had taken the old form and did not know about the new form. They might not have been watching telly last night. This might go on for months before people realise that they are trying to lodge an outdated form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might say, `Who cares if the profession is disrupted?' I do not suppose anybody on the other side does, but their clients care if they are disrupted and the cost is increased. As I understand it, most of the forms in the Family Court are available on disk. But this has been rushed for convenience, like I suspect this bill is&mdash;let's pick Easter rather than the Queen's birthday weekend&mdash;so this new divorce kit is not available on disk. What does that mean if you go off to a small practice in the country or a big city firm with a big family law practice in it? It means they get out the typewriter&mdash;cross, tick, cross, tick. We are back to 1970s technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court had extensive negotiations about the new form to try to make it better. That is what we have done here. We have had extensive negotiations over the evidence bill to try to get it as good as we can. When it came to the implementation, the profession found out on 16 January&mdash;some of them might have found out a bit earlier, but not much earlier&mdash;that a new form would be coming in on 1 February and that the old form would not be acceptable and that they cannot get the new forms on disk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not like to think we are making the same sort of mistake here. The mistake in the Family Court matter is able to be remedied only by upgraded costs to solicitors and clients. Any mistake here is not so easily remedied because you cannot identify when a member of the profession is not up to scratch because they have not had sufficient notice. I would like the government to point out why it thinks a couple of months and 18 days is really sufficient for the introduction of this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Archives Amendment Bill 1994, but I will make a few general comments. This bill seems to have come about because the government has been basically asleep on the job in terms of the consequences for archives of the privatisation of a number of government business enterprises. We have now apparently reached the point where the government realises that it is necessary to take legislative action to prevent any further erosion of the archives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative for this bill comes from the National Archives Council, of which Senator Margaret Reid has been a member for some 10 years. I think it alerted the government to the fact that a number of things were being done on an ad hoc basis and it was necessary to adopt an overall strategy. Although belated, I think this legislation is certainly welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that there are already a number of GBEs which have been translated into the private sector and, in respect of each of those, there are different rules that apply. For example, a specific clause was put into the Moomba pipeline legislation in order to protect its records. In the case of CSL however, archives had to reach an agreement with it about redepositing records which had simply gone with the organisation. The Commonwealth Bank seems to have always been above the law in this regard and has always held its own records. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation similarly took its records with it and some have been subsequently retrieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aussat records were transferred to Optus when Optus acquired the Aussat satellite. Again, because of the very ad hoc and ill-thought out nature of the exercise, it decided that it did not make much commercial sense to hang on to presumably vast quantities of useless information and it handed them back to archives. Australian Airlines used to hold its own records but when it became part of Qantas, archives lost control of those records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a whole series of patchwork solutions that have been arrived at by default. Until now the government has not been prepared to take action to coordinate its approach. But, finally, we now seem to have adopted a principle where, unless the legislation specifically states otherwise, the records will remain with the archives. That being the case, it is certainly an advance on the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Archives are clearly the most appropriate place for the control of these documents. They are the ones in a position to make any judgments that need to be made about the selection of documents. I assume that they bend over backwards to retain almost everything. That is as it should be. An independent body should have responsibility for this rather than someone who is directly involved, perhaps having good commercial or other reasons for deciding that they prefer to see certain records no longer in existence. I simply say that we support that amendment. We similarly support the amendment in relation to the national witness protection program and those changes which allow the Australian Federal Police to retain certain sensitive documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to contribute briefly to this debate because the Archives Amendment Bill is an important piece of legislation for the Australian Archives. The Archives Bill was passed through the parliament in 1983. It is interesting that the explanatory memorandum pointed out that the Archives had already been in existence some 40 years at that time. So we are talking about one of the older institutions of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Archives still does not have its proper home in the parliamentary triangle, and I hope that will be dealt with before too many more years pass. Although the Archives keeps a lot of papers and documents&mdash;the records of the tax office may well be boring, but those of a lot of other departments are really very interesting&mdash;it also has a great deal of material which is presently stored in repositories around Australia which is worth looking at and which should be on display as part of the history and heritage of this country. I hope this material will be on display. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat dismayed at the abandonment of the Museum of Australia. It made me think that the Archives, as a building for display, might also slip away due to those who do not regard the displaying and making available of the history and heritage of the country as something of significance. For example, the Archives has all the original models and proposals for the provisional Parliament House. It has so many things that are worth looking at. It is a pity that people cannot see these things. If there is a building in the parliamentary triangle, it will become one of the important institutions and places for people to visit. A great deal of research is done through the records of the Archives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We realise that it has become quite important that, if government institutions are to be sold, the government records of those enterprises should be retained and be made available as others are. Senator Alston has been through some of the recent examples of what has occurred with those records. It is necessary that this amendment to the Archives Act is passed to assist in seeing that there are fairly clearly defined arrangements for the future. There are a number of ways of dealing with this issue, and several have already been dealt with. A document that I have been given reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the only existing remedies for this problem&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of government business enterprise documents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">are to seek to have provisions for retention of the records included in the legislation authorising the sale of the enterprise, to bring the records back into the coverage of the Act by regulation or to induce the new owner to deposit the older records with Australian Archives . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As has been mentioned, this has occurred. But all of these are somewhat uncertain. There needs to be some proper arrangement for the records to be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about some of the records of sections of departments which have been closed down in recent times that have not been given to the Archives. It is inevitable that there will be changes to the function of government. Some things become irrelevant after a period; new things come along. I have recently heard of instances where sections of departments have been closed down and the records have been left somewhere and not given to the Archives. It has even been suggested to me that millions of dollars of assets in drawings and technical information in certain areas of construction have not been properly deposited and recorded. If the Commonwealth wanted to go back over some of those matters of infrastructure, the records may not be able to be found as one would expect that they should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other areas about which Australian Archives is very aware. We need to look closely at the original act to see whether it is adequate to cover them. Some of us have mastered quite well E-mail and some of the new means of communication. Others of us still marvel at what can occur even in our own offices. We need to look at how that material is to be recorded. Documents that are drafted on computers can be changed many times before one gets a final version. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the old system, whereby these documents were produced on paper, the original drafts would also be available. They also tell a story of how something emerged and evolved. Much of that is now lost because one can bring up a document on the machine and amend it. What went on and why it went on is lost. I cannot help thinking about the little yellow stickers that we put all over things these days. Once upon a time, cabinet notebooks and other documents had handwritten notes. Frequently, that is the most interesting part of a document. We will not find much of that any more, because the interesting bits are on the little yellow stickers that may be removed or which may fall off anyway. A lot of the history may well be lost and not available for historians in time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been reading through the 1993 act. It does not specifically refer to only written documents. It refers to documents and records. Perhaps it was written without it being adequately expansive for the means of communication these days. Even in 1983 the most senior public servants had a secretary. They now do not. It is all done by machine and done quite differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the country retain its history. It is part of the heritage. I know that Australian Archives is looking at these technical changes. In any event, it also needs the resources to explore and examine them and to find out how to keep the tapes and records that are made of documents these days. We all know what has happened with the National Film and Sound Archives and what has occurred to the old films and the steps that have to be taken to preserve them and keep them in good condition. Australian Archives needs to be adequately resourced to see that it can do the things that it knows need to be done with the records of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Alston has outlined, the opposition supports this bill. There are not many times when one gets a chance to talk about the Archives. The annual report always comes in on the night before the Senate adjourns for Christmas. The opportunity to stand up and talk then is very limited indeed. So this bill's coming in gives me an opportunity to raise some of the matters that I think are significant: the building; the new means of communication; and the records of government departments which are closed down and disposed of either by sale or by just coming to an end. They are significant. I hope that we will continue to record the history of the country and make it available for future generations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Archives Amendment Bill 1994. The coalition supports this bill for two very important purposes. It clarifies the current legislation relating to the records of the national witness protection program. The bill also ensures that records of the Commonwealth that are inadvertently removed from the operation of the Archives Act 1983 when public bodies change their structure to government business enterprises that are commercialised, incorporated or privatised are not lost to the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mechanism for the proper archiving of Commonwealth, state and private records in Australia is vital. At the national level, we must set an example with proper levels of funding and support for the latest methods to save archival material. As a member of the council of the Australian National Library, I pay tribute to the library's contribution to archiving our national history. A main corporative objective of the ANL is to collect and preserve Australian documentary material of national significance and ensure that this material is available to all Australians. The Australian National Library has addressed in its council, of which I am a member, a number of issues related to this. One of the great problems with the collection and preservation of this sort of material is that there are two key questions to answer: firstly, what will be collected; and, secondly, once it is collected, how is it stored in a form to guarantee that it will be there over a long time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an interesting debate at the council one day when we went through all the different media in which material can be stored. Film has enormous problems, particularly the older films made with nitrate before the Second World War, which are now deteriorating very rapidly. What sort of processes and expenses will we go to to ensure that this material is properly preserved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are video tapes. I do not know whether any senators have seen colour video tapes from 1975 when colour television first started in this country. There has been a marked deterioration in quality over a 20-year period. Under current systems of recording material, given another 20 years all of this will be lost. We looked at computer disks. We all know what happens on a computer disk. If we press the wrong key at the wrong time we can make huge slabs of information  totally disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the discussion at the Australian National Library was what we came back to in the end as the safest form of storage, and that is books. Back to the old technology of books where, if preserved properly in airconditioned premises, we can probably guarantee up to 600, 700 or 800 years for the preservation of material. The problem with that is the vast amount of written material and the storage space required. Storing material in this form creates all sorts of cost problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the most interesting material that has been stored is early Australian film. I had the opportunity once to visit the national film office in Canberra and look at some of the material that had been kept for an exhibition for people interested in the Art Deco era of Australia back in the 1920s and 1930s. The film office put on a day for the Art Deco society and played radio recordings of the old shows in those days. It showed film from those days&mdash;all the old <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dad and Dave</EMPHASIS> films&mdash;and pictures of the original parliament with the beautiful Art Deco architecture that was created there before being extended in cheap ways. That material is vital to our national heritage, but because of the nitrate film used at that time we are in danger of losing it&mdash;it faces the possibility of destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great problem we have now on the second issue I raised&mdash;what we keep as opposed to the way in which we store it&mdash;is the vast volume of material that is created every day. Just think of how many newspapers have been created in Australia on this day, how many books and how many magazines; how much film is created for television every night and radio recordings from every station right around Australia. Of that material, what do we hold on to, store and archive? Some rather tragic examples from the past show how we can lose precious material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Hills</EMPHASIS> that was recorded by the ABC and produced 1,700 episodes has only six part episodes left. By lack of diligence the rest just got lost or destroyed in the system. The Jack Davey show, which was very popular through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, was recorded on large acetate discs which were obviously taking up a lot of room at the radio studio. Those discs were used as fill in the Warringah expressway. All the original Jack Davey shows are now under the Warringah expressway. All that precious Australiana has been lost because of lack of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has to put some resources behind the archival system in Australia. It is not just a matter of building a building and storing the material in it. What the archives office has to have is more resources so that it can be pro-active in educating organisations on ways in which to store material in a preliminary form&mdash;not throwing it away&mdash;so that later on archivists can come searching for original material and sorting and selecting can be done. It is expensive but we only get once chance. Once we have lost this material it is gone forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a new problem presented to us. With the information superhighway coming across Australia, in the new communications age, there is going to be an enormous amount of material that will not only come down the line from other countries but will also leave Australia for other countries. We will be selling a whole range of new products on the information superhighway. This will be a great new export industry: a whole range of new products will flourish. In the past, we had a problem: we lost bits of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dad and Dave</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Hills</EMPHASIS> and the Jack Davey show.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not quite catch all of that question because of the interjections in this chamber, but I will answer that part of the question that I did hear. It is true that the US electronics company Methode Electronics has decided to relocate its operations in the Asia-Pacific from Singapore to Australia. The Methode Electronics fibre optic product group will control the manufacturing, sales and distribution of that company's products, the fibre-optic products, in the whole of the Asia-Pacific area from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Methode will invest $20 million in Australia over the next five years, create 50 new jobs and, because of this relocation, increase the high technology exports out of this country by having export earnings of $20 million a year. It will certainly strengthen Australia's reputation in this part of the world as a premier location for electronics information technology and high technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the question that I heard goes to the issue of the performance of the Australian services sector. The Australian services sector represents 70 per cent of all economic activity in Australia, employs 80 per cent of workers in this country and is noted as a sector of intelligent exports. Output in the services sector has shown rapid acceleration over recent years. Production is up by 12.2 per cent in the last 3 1/2 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of exports, the services sector is a big export performer and our exports have been strengthening from that sector, the most recent example being IBM, which yesterday announced record earnings of $420 million from exports from Wangaratta in Australia. It is indeed a success story. Importantly, $134 million of its earnings from exports were from software services supplied from Australia to the Asia-Pacific area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the services sector, investment across the board has increased. New investment is expanding. It is up by 38 per cent from June 1993, and the ABS forecasts on investment for this sector show a growth of 42.1 per cent in investment in the current financial year. I can also add that the National Australia Bank quarterly business survey says that this sector looks forward to and is confident about its growth prospects in the future and looks forward to sustained economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important indicator for Australia is employment. The Bureau of Industry Economics industry briefs on the services sector show that the services sector has accounted for almost all of the employment growth in the Australian economy since 1991. A total of 420,800 Australians found jobs in the services sector in the 21 months to December 1994. A big chunk of the government's commitment at the last election to deliver half a million jobs, which will now be delivered one year ahead of time, is due to the buoyant performance in this sector and has caused the government to revise upwards job growth in the most recent indicators and to revise downwards the level of unemployment in this country.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Criticisms have been based on false assumptions such as, firstly, that any disturbance renders the whole coupe of no conservation value. By way of example I have used before, a quarry of a few hectares in a coupe out of an area of, say, 130 hectares does not mean that that coupe does not retain high conservation values.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have any figures that relate directly to woodchips per se. Woodchips are part of an integrated forest approach and are dependent on the performance of other sectors of the forest industry. These estimates vary, but about 60 per cent of a sawlog goes to sawn timber. The remaining 40 per cent waste material would classically then be feedstock for woodchipping. The industry is integrated and you cannot differentiate one part of the industry from another and apportion capital costs thereby. Certainly, we do not have any figures for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woodchips themselves are the lowest value added form of forest product and they are feedstock, as I have said, for pulp and paper production. We do have statistics on exports of pulpwood, most of which I think is exports of woodchips. In 1993-94, exports of pulpwood from Australia were valued at $454 million. Total exports for the forest industry that year were valued at $860 million. Imports for the industry that year were valued at $2.6 billion&mdash;that is, other nations' forests. Therefore, the net deficit to the current account was $1.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication of the question that somehow the existence of woodchipping exports is a net negative to the current account is, I think, a nonsensical proposition. The government is committed to a balance between environmental values&mdash;and protecting those&mdash;and protecting and providing a rational development plan for this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy, which we support and have been a key in getting together with the mainland states, involves a phasing out of woodchip exports by the year 2000. That does not mean to say that woodchipping per se would stop. We would hope that the woodchipping that is done then is consumed domestically in Australia and value is added to it for import replacement and/or export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the second part of the question about the La Trobe University study, I have not had an opportunity to examine, nor do I believe my colleague the Treasurer has had an opportunity to examine, this study in any detail, but I do note that it refers to a state government forestry policy issue, not a federal government forestry policy issue. The states do have control, under the constitution, of those forests, not us. Not having looked at it in detail, I do note as well, however, that the subsidies are presented as estimates and cover a wide range. I also note that the subsidies referred to do not appear to be directly related to wood exports. Therefore, the link with our balance of payments is not that clear-cut.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a lot of understandable comment and analysis on the implications of the deteriorating current account deficit, and it is unquestionably the case that that current account deficit has a significant element of bad news in it. But, as is so often the case, bad news tends to drive out good. While the government, as has been made very clear by the Treasurer, does have to respond to that current account deficit&mdash;and the Treasurer has made clear the way in which we will do that&mdash;any sober analysis, stripped of all the histrionics, the over-dramatisation and over-simplification, will reveal that a key element of that deterioration has been the rapid growth in capital goods imports at over 24 per cent in the last year. Of course, there are other factors, many of which Senator Gareth Evans referred to yesterday in his answer. But I do not want to give an analysis of it. I want to refer only to this point about the 24 per cent increase in capital goods imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that this surge in capital investment, reflected in the balance of payments, will serve to increase the productive capacity of the Australian economy to meet the demands of Australians as well as those of our trading partners. That, of course, is good news. It is very much the measure of the transformation of the Australian economy over the past decade from the closed, cosseted economy that we were left with to an internationally open and competitive economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it in succinct terms, the difference between the very serious situation that we confronted in 1985-86 and today is that in 1985-86 the balance of payments was being driven by paying for the mythical resources investment bust that was promoted by Fraser and Howard in the early 1980s. Today the current account deficit reflects, in large part, an investment surge directed at increasing the capacity of the economy to export and to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate the point that I am making, there has been an analysis done by my department which we will be publishing shortly. It shows, amongst other things, that manufactured exports have increased to be more than 30 per cent of our exports in the last financial year, compared to less than 20 per cent in 1983-84. For elaborately transformed manufactures, the change has been even more dramatic. In the last financial year, 1993-94, ETMs increased by 16 per cent, and they have more than doubled since 1989. Reinforcing this picture of Australia as an exporter of sophisticated manufactures, our exports of office and ADP equipment increased by more than 50 per cent to $800 million last year, and exports of telecommunications equipment jumped to $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All recent surveys of the manufacturing sector indicate that this strong export performance will continue and is, in fact, underpinned by the capital investment now taking place. For example, the survey of manufacturing in New South Wales released on Monday indicates that a quarter of manufacturers plan to increase new capital investment over the next quarter, which is good news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am trying to say is that the story is always more complex than the simplistic first headline would indicate.

In signing that document, governments agreed that there ought to be a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose with all the emotion being generated by the woodchips issue it is a bit difficult for anyone to find any emotion to spare for the prospect of great violence and suffering in a small country far away. The response of the opposition demonstrates exactly that. The situation in Burundi is very worrying. We have all seen from the deeply tragic and appalling history of Rwanda what can happen when situations in exactly parallel social and political circumstances get out of hand. I think the failure of the international community to respond expeditiously and effectively to the situation in Rwanda should be one of the most appalling blots on the international conscience in recent decades. We ought to learn from that experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in Burundi is very worrying indeed at the moment. The Australian government is aware of and deplores reports that the President of the Tutsi based Union for National Progress, or Uprona, has called for the resignation of Burundi's Prime Minister and for the overthrow of the coalition government of that country using `all necessary means'. That is a very alarming prospect. It is part of an ongoing pattern of instability which has been developing in the country. In December Uprona threatened to withdraw from a coalition with Burundi's other major political party, Frodebu, the Front for Democracy in Burundi. The government's collapse was only very narrowly averted at that time by the replacement of a controversial Hutu Speaker in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN Secretary-General's representative in Burundi, in Bujumbura, has described the situation at the moment as controllable but bad and deteriorating rapidly. It is possible that the parties could divide into separate factions. If this does occur, there is a very real prospect of widespread violence erupting, large population movements being generated and another massive humanitarian crisis occurring all over again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening internationally in response to this is occurring at three levels&mdash;and it is important to appreciate it&mdash;at the level of preventive diplomacy, preventive deployment and peace building. Preventive diplomacy efforts involve the UN Security Council issuing a presidential statement just a couple of days ago, on 31 January, denouncing attempts to overthrow the coalition government, condemning the extremist groups which continue to undermine it and calling on all parties to refrain from violence and give support to the government institutions which were established in line with the previous effort in preventive diplomacy under the convention of government of September last year. The Security Council also discussed a proposal to send a mission to Burundi as a follow-up to the mission in August last year but that is on hold at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of preventive deployment, that is, the sending of military personnel for preventive purposes, the Secretary-General has proposed that there be UN guards installed in a humanitarian base at Bujumbura airport and a ready reaction force located in Zaire to intervene in Burundi if the situation deteriorates. That is still on the table of the UN in New York. In the view of the special representative the prospect of it is keeping some pressure on extremist elements. It is important to appreciate that that has not yet been the subject of actual decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preventive diplomacy efforts involving diplomatic or political efforts or preventive deployment efforts of the kind I have just described are only part of the picture. It is very crucial if you are approaching the issue of prevention seriously in these sorts of internal situations to place effort on building effective governmental institutions and meeting the development, the social and economic needs of the country. To that extent Australia is doing its small bit&mdash;and I hasten to add it is only small at the moment&mdash;through earmarking a proportion, some $30,000, of our UN voluntary fund for human rights contribution for technical assistance to Burundi. Many more efforts of this kind by us as well as other countries need to be set in train if we are to make a difference at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will certainly continue to monitor the situation closely and I hope that disaster there can be avoided.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. AIDAB regularly raises the issue of coercive family planning practices in its annual high-level discussions with the Chinese government, clearly setting out guidelines that all family-planning related programs Australia funds must comply with Australian government principles on population.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most recent high-level consultations with China took place in Melbourne in September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These guidelines specify that family planning is to be voluntary and emphasise the need for quality of care in family planning service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB makes the same representations throughout the negotiation of individual projects.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to Australia's two major family planning projects, we have concluded written agreements with the Chinese authorities guaranteeing that no coercive practices will be em ployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. China's human rights performance is closely monitored by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade including the Human Rights Section. The human rights situation overall in China remains of concern to Australia and this Government has expressed its concern about human rights in China on numerous occasions. In addition to multilateral efforts to foster observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights in China I have raised the Australian Government's concerns about continuing human rights violations at the highest levels, including during discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Jakarta in November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's obligation under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is to provide protection to those with a well-founded fear of persecution due to their nationality, race, religion, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. Under the Convention, there is no obligation to provide refuge to those who are subject to generalised policies applicable to all citizens without discrimination. The only obligation is to protect people who fear persecution because they belong to particular groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department, including the Human Rights Section, has been regularly consulted by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the development of the amendments to the Migration Act before the Senate. The Department's assessment is that there is no evidence to suggest that returned asylum seekers will suffer any discrimination or persecution on their return to China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to Senator Harradine's concern about the possibility of a pregnant woman asylum seeker being returned to China, it is longstanding government policy that the return of people with no right to remain in Australia is only carried out where the returnee's safety and dignity is assured. This will apply to pregnant women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would point out that the application of China's one-child policy does not generally provide for forced abortions however in particular provinces or villages there may be an application of the policy which differs from central Government directives and a risk of forced abortion may exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Migration Act amendment legislation provides only that fertility control policies shall not be taken into account in refugee applications where they are argued as the basis for establishing the applicant's membership of a particular social group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, where a Chinese refugee applicant is a member of a pre-existing social group, such as an inhabitant of a particular village or province or a member of a particular factory or work unit in which fertility control policies are carried out in a persecutory manner&mdash;such as by the practice of forced abortion&mdash;they are not excluded from the protection of the legislation. This is because they fear persecution on the basis of their membership of a social group other than the unacceptably broad group of "Chinese subject to fertility control policies."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I further understand the Act allows for a non-compellable Ministerial discretion in particular circumstances to allow individuals to make applications for refugee status despite their initial exclusion by other provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act also contains health provisions which would preclude travel by any women in an advanced stage of pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Australia supplied 105 ultrasound machines to China in 1991/92&mdash;and stands by that decision.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that ultrasound technology can be misused should not be allowed to overshadow the legitimate and highly beneficial role it can play </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in improving the health and welfare of pregnant women and their children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many family planning facilities in China have access to ultrasound equipment&mdash;an article in The Economist, September 18, 1993, reported that medical equipment factories in China manufacture 10,000 ultrasound machines a year.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently most family planning facilities in China have access to ultrasound equipment very little of it sourced in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">China's family planning regulations prohibit the use of ultrasound for the purposes of gender selection.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clearly not possible for the Chinese government to police the use of every machine, particularly those which are in the hands of medical practitioners and/or health workers who are outside the public health system.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enquiries confirmed that Australian machines provided under DIFF funding were distributed to major health and research institutions where their usage is most likely to be monitored to ensure compliance with family planning regulations.</PARA>

<PARA>For the past two or three days the opposition has had a concerted effort in relation to asking questions relating to this very important issue. Indeed, yesterday we led off our questions by asking about the problems with the trade deficit. Of course, the industry that is represented outside this place provides a lot of assistance to lowering our economic problems. But what government members have done is refused to answer the questions put to them by the opposition. Indeed, yesterday when we sought to extend question time so more questions could be asked they ran away because they did not want to have any more questions asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the minister for the environment has not told&mdash;and, indeed, refuses to tell&mdash;the people of Australia why over $100,000 of taxpayers' funds was given to a mickey mouse organisation to provide a report on which he relied and which is now shown to be absolutely and utterly flawed.

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in trying to come in and fix it, told us the figure was 509. But when we count them we realise there are 511. So the government, in its haste, cannot even count the coupes that it is talking about. When we look at those 511 coupes we see that some of them had been clear-felled as little as three months ago in places including my home state of Tasmania. Today Senator Crane and Senator Brownhill gave examples of places in their states of Western Australia and New South Wales. This is an absolute farce.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One picture is worth a thousand words. I have a picture taken from what is known as the Picton coupe 24C. You will see, on close examination of this picture, that it actually shows regrowth from a devastating bushfire. You can see the dead trees in the adjoining forest. I remind the Senate that 95 per cent of this coupe has actually been logged, yet the contractors, under direction from the government, are being prevented from returning to this area. I also remind you that sitting on this coupe are 30 tonnes of logs ready for transport. They are on the woodchipped area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you further look at this picture, you will notice that the high surrounding hills are not being logged and never will be logged above a certain altitude. Tasmania has some of the best forest practices in the world and we can see that from this picture. The tragedy is that forest workers are being locked out of this area by government decree. Today the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) would not even agree to contractors returning to work so that they can at least finish the remaining five per cent and clean up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania is in the height of the bushfire season. You can see the problem in the picture. Arsonists are likely to get in that coupe, and not only could that area be fired but also the adjoining area with fires possibly sweeping into the top vegetated hills. This government decree is an irresponsible action that could result from the minister's decision. There is a need for an immediate return to work to clear up these areas where there is absolutely no high conservation value, as this picture shows. Urgent action must be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I declare to the Senate that I am a small shareholder in North Ltd, a subsidiary of North Forest Products, which is one of the companies involved in forestry. The parent company is very concerned and has sent letters to its shareholders about some factually incorrect and misleading statements which are jeopardising workers' jobs at sawmills and the like. I want to quote a couple of extracts to put the correct position. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective forest practices in Tasmania have been development progressively over many years. Since 1971 there have been 17 formal government inquiries into forestry in Tasmania in which the industry has been subject to the most rigorous&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not the Natalie-type assessments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">environmental assessment. Tasmania retains more than 80 per cent of its original forest cover as estimated prior to European settlement. The land that no longer contains forest has in the main been converted into farm pasture and urban development. Of the forests in Tasmania more than 30 per cent are currently protected from commercial forestry and 30 per cent is managed for multiple use including wood production and recreation with the remaining forest being on private land. Of the multiple use forests available for the forest industry, less than one per cent is harvested in any one year and those areas that are harvested are regenerated under the supervision of the forestry commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us get back to this picture that I am showing to honourable senators. Normally this logged area would be controlled and supervised by the contractors. In late autumn there would be a burn and the area would be regenerated. So in a few years we would have a young, vibrant forest replacing something that has been burnt. We could see this as an essential ingredient to proper management practices in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the truth is that Australian forests are not disappearing, and that is the issue I want to leave with you today. These forests are being managed responsibly and will continue to be managed responsibly.

Secondly, the opposition seems to be arguing that if an area is damaged in any way whatsoever then it is okay to go in and damage it further. This is to argue that if a person is raped it is okay to rape them again. If I break Senator Ian Macdonald's right arm, I  could go in and break his left arm. That is a non sequitur. It is a stupid argument that the opposition is using.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are areas which have been damaged which, perhaps because they are contiguous with an area of high conservation value, are themselves important to be protected. One looks forward to the day when there will be a proper, conserved area of forests in Australia. This may indeed involve areas which currently have been damaged in some way. The fact that those values have in any way been impeached in the past, even in the recent past, is not an argument that these areas should not be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard from Senator Abetz a short time ago a lot of absolute nonsense about the way in which only the waste is used and about the way forestry workers clean up the forest floor, preventing bushfire. I have been in forests which have been clear-felled and cut down from North Queensland down to Tasmania, from Victoria and New South Wales through to Western Australia. In every case, massive amounts of timber have been left on the forest floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember going in Tasmania to the edge of the World Heritage area on the Great Western Tiers&mdash;a steep slope which had been clear-felled only a few weeks beforehand and then burnt by the forestry people. It contained logs well over 60 centimetres in diameter and 15 or 20 feet long. This was some months ago. That is exactly the situation that obtains, as I indicated yesterday, because the structure of the industry ties the poor devils who have the logging rigs to taking the maximum weight of logs out of the forest. It is not economic for them to pick up all the smaller branches and other material which could be chipped. So the claim that all this material is going into chips is a nonsense. It is simply untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I pick up the answer of the minister today. He said to me that these 509 coupes contain one-fifteenth of one per cent of Australia's forested area, or half of one per cent of the area available for forestry. I stress: if the forestry industry needs to go into this minuscule proportion so urgently, then it follows very logically that this industry is basically unsustainable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald's question said that we have been blatantly misled by the minister's insisting that he has been rigorous in identifying the forests of high conservation values. The minister has been absolutely blatantly misleading the Senate as he does not really know anything about the coupes; he does not know anything about the compartments. It is interesting that in one of his answers to me he was talking about coupes. A coupe is a part of a compartment; a compartment is not a part of a coupe. Basically I think he needs to get his phraseology right to start with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answering my question and a lot of previous questions he tried to outline a number of factors in respect of what is deemed as high conservation, including old-growth areas, endangered species, world heritage, areas of high biodiversity, significant Aboriginal sites et cetera. But how then, I ask the minister, can the government assess an area that was logged in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s as having those characteristics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also mentioned in answering my question&mdash;or not answering, I should say&mdash;that he was waiting on the cooperation of the New South Wales government. The fact is that the New South Wales Premier, John Fahey, has written to the minister six times to establish a definition of the methodology to be used to determine high conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the fault lies back here with the Commonwealth government. The fact is that it has been sitting on its hands. While it has been sitting on its hands, we have people around this building today, and it is costing them a fortune to be here. One person told me that it was costing him $1,000 a day for his lorries to be here to protest. He should not even have to be here.

He was not quite the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories today; he was the minister for the environment minus woodchips today because woodchips have now been given to Senator Collins. So I wonder what will happen next week. Maybe another bit of his portfolio might be chopped off. It is a rehash of the environmental portfolio when I think Mrs Kelly was minister? Yes, I think she was the minister for environment or something, and she seemed to fall by the wayside. Now this minister is making the same mistakes that Mrs Kelly made; he is not getting the facts right before a decision is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of my question, which I failed to get an answer to, was to establish the characteristics of the Pappinbarra State Forest, which the minister considers important enough to declare as a high conservation area. You only have to call the office of the chief forester in the area to get the whole forest history of Pappinbarra and to find out that timber has been continually extracted from the area since 1924. How could that area have high conservation value if that is happening? It really astounds me that the minister has not looked into it. How can a forest that has been extensively logged for so many years now have a high conservation value?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see the minister walk outside the front of this building and speak with some of the timber workers who work up in that particular area.

If the big bang theory is correct, you would expect the structure to be of a certain nature. By looking at the filamentary structure which is evident in the disposition of galaxies throughout the universe, we are given some idea of the forces which were involved in the creation of the universe. We are also given some clues as to how the universe is expected to continue to expand and maybe ultimately contract. </PARA>

<PARA>The ANL annual report indicates that the company has made a loss of $129.6 million. The accounts show that $106 million of that loss was due to abnormal items. The outstanding thing under note 16 of the balance sheet of the company is a provision of $100 million this year compared with a provision of $16 million the previous year. There has also been a substantial writing down in the value of total non-current assets, which includes property, plant, equipment, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing for the Senate to note is that the net value of the assets of the company&mdash;the net shareholding value of the company on the balance sheet&mdash;is $26 million. As the auditor says in his report, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and that, therefore, on that basis this company did have a positive value. I contrast that with the comment of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) on 22 August last year that ANL could not be given away. The report that he quoted then indicated that it had a negative value of between $70 and $118 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite right. I also note in the annual report that the company had a write-off, a tax loss, of $14.7 million from the sale of 25 per cent of Australian Stevedores. That was a shareholding held by ANL. The government sold that shareholding against the recommendation of two boards of ANL&mdash;the first board under Chairman Bolitho, which was sacked on 22 August last year, and the new board under Neville Wran. Both recommended against the sale. They said that it was a very valuable asset, yet I note in the accounts that there was a $14.7 million write-off from that sale. So that needs to be investigated further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we look forward to actually finding out what is behind these provisions of up to $100 million, particularly $78 million, mentioned in the accounts. The auditor, in signing off the accounts, qualifies it to the extent of saying that it is subject to the continuing financial support of the government and the effect of such adjustments or reclassifications which might result from any decisions taken by the board. In view of the fact that the Senate has referred the matter of the sale of ANL to a Senate inquiry, we can look forward to investigating those questions in the near future. We must get answers to them. In the end, I am sure that we will be condemning Minister Brereton for his handling of this matter, particularly when one considers that this is a public asset and he deliberately went out and devalued it by saying that it could not be given away. </PARA>

<PARA>Today we are debating a motion of which I gave notice in the Senate on Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week has exposed a motley bunch of divided, confused snake oil salesmen. This week Fagin has been caught out in a monstrous con. He has dumped on his ministers and left them to take the blame and the flak. And so they should. But the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is where the buck stops. He has to also take the blame. The truth, as the opposition has shown again and again, is that this government has no forest policy. It has ministers in charge of departments over which they have no control. It is interesting that today in question time Senator Faulkner lost the woodchip part of the debate from his portfolio and it has been taken up by Senator Collins. I could say it is a chip off the block. It is a real kick in the teeth for the Minister for the Environment that he has not been able to answer any of the questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have been making statements on policy that they know they cannot implement and have no conscience in seeing a valuable resource industry grind to a halt. The industry has had nowhere where to go. It has no security. This government has no concern for the real issues: jobs, people, towns, villages and livelihoods and the very existence of human beings in those areas. At a time when we have the biggest monthly current account deficit on record our export industries are being hijacked by ill-informed greenies bankrolled by a foppish environment minister who has used money provided by taxpayers. Some of those taxpayers are outside this building today and in the building&mdash;the forest workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a third rate three-ring circus in control in Canberra today. It used to be called the federal Labor government. It is Labor's loopy lightweights this week. In one ring the Prime Minister slinks around bullying his bodyguards to keep forest workers out of sight&mdash;`out of sight, out of mind', he says, making only one appearance in parliament to face the music. And what music it was. We have an environment minister who is not only incompetent but gullible and, who, having replaced a minister who let her department give her the mushroom treatment, knows no more about this portfolio than she did. He does not even have the whiteboards to blame. Why has he brought the timber industry to its knees? Why has he, in concert with the Prime Minister, allowed this to happen? We have a resources minister who is the salami in the sandwich but who is also so lacking in conscience that he sees nothing wrong in issuing licences one week and asking for them back the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of key elements to this debate. We have, on the one hand, the coalition asking again and again how the Minister for the Environment and/or the Prime Minister arrived at their first and second mythical list of sacrosanct areas and, on the other, the Minister for the Environment saying over and over again that they are all areas of high conservation value. We have a coalition exposing the list compartment after compartment, coupe after coupe, day after day and the only response from the government is that the list is based on the best advice. I would like to suggest that Natalie and others might not have given the best advice. I think they were in error with most of the advice they gave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an industry worth something like $859 million, involving some 85,000 employees. They are just the direct ones; a heck of a lot more are tied up with the timber industry outside that. We have a timber import bill of $1.8 billion, a national balance of payments blowout of $28 billion, and hundreds of trucks worth millions of dollars lying idle around this building because their owners have no job security and all the federal Labor government can say is that it is not its fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repeatedly this week the Minister for the Environment has tried to claim that this chaos is the fault of the state governments. Let me remind the Minister for the Environment if he does not already know&mdash;and on his track record anything is possible&mdash;that the New South Wales Premier on no less than six occasions and as recently as 24 January 1995 wrote to the Prime Minister seeking a definition of the methodology to be used to determine areas of high conservation value. With the debacle of the list as exposed this week it is obvious that a clear definition is urgently needed. The New South Wales state government is still awaiting what it requested nearly two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the Prime Minister provided those guidelines it would not have been necessary for the timber industry to grind to a halt and to come to Canberra. The security of the jobs ensuring that rural communities remain viable and the provision of valuable export dollars must surely be more important than attempting to shore up the greenie vote in the cities. We are talking about real lives. We are talking about real jobs. My colleague Senator Gibson summed it up well the other day when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole thing was a sham, and the minister and the government know it. It was a deliberate move by the government to try to con suburban Melbourne and Sydney that it was supportive of Green sentiments. The government thought it could play one side of the coin as well as the other by renewing the licences. It thought it could get away with doing that. The demonstration outside this parliament by the people who are directly affected and the demonstrations that have been in Tasmania, Perth and in forest areas all around the nation show that it will not work.</PARA>
<PARA>Look at some of the people who have come here at great expense. One whole town&mdash;which I am sure Senator Troeth will talk about&mdash;in Victoria has completely closed up for people to come here. From my state of New South Wales people have come from the north, from the south east, from all the way up the coast. You would have to be a pretty heartless government&mdash;a pretty heartless person, Senator Ray&mdash;to sit there and not have a concern for those people who have no job security. We have enough people out of work in Australia as it is without putting another heap of people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Prime Minister do? He believes that politics is just a game and that postulating in question time every once in a while is all that is required to lead this country. But this is no game. </PARA>

Look at those trucks out there, those prime movers. They cost $250,000 or $300,000 each. I would suggest that while those outside and inside this building today appear hale and hearty, there are a lot of very worried people among them. These trucks attract large repayments. These people do not have $300,000 to put into a truck thinking it will pay for itself sitting in a protest out here. They have come here in a very serious way to bring their point to the government, a government that I believe has been callous, especially the Prime Minister in the way he has approached this issue.

Those people have to put food on the table for their families. I know what it is like. Everyone in this place has heard stories about the drought. It is another type of drought these people are experiencing at the moment. The owners of timber companies have wages to meet. They have bank managers to satisfy. They have to have business plans and cash flow projections to secure loans to keep their doors open. I mentioned earlier today that one truck owner told me that it is costing him over $1,000 a day just to have his five trucks here and to look after his men who drove the trucks up here. Spare a thought for them, minister. I hope that Senator Faulkner and the Prime Minister spare a thought for the callous way they have gone about taking the jobs away from these people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also refer to the national forest policy statement which was first drafted two years ago. This policy statement makes laudable environmental statements but it also canvasses basic economic objectives that should be and can be achieved by sustainable forest industry. The statement talks about efficient and effective management of the nation's resources and the contribution that forest based activities make to the national economy and regional and local employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government vision&mdash;that is the word that is used&mdash;is supposed to encompass `a range of sustainable forest-based industries, founded on excellence and innovation'. I can tell you, and I can tell the Senate, that the number of forest based industries in my own state of Victoria do indeed possess those qualities of excellence and innovation but at the moment they are not being given any opportunity to use those qualities. These industries should be expanding to contribute further to regional and national economic employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the statement, forest management should be effective and responsive to the community. Perhaps Senator Faulkner could explain this part of the vision to the community of something like 3,000 timber workers and their families who are outside Parliament House at the moment and who have made the long trip to Canberra. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian community will have a sound understanding of the values of forests and sustainable forest management, and will participate in decision-making processes relating to forest use and management.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the 3,000 people outside Parliament House at the moment have no participation in the decision making process. They have found it necessary to leave their homes and their businesses to come to Canberra and make their opinions known because there is no way, except at the ballot box, they will be allowed to express an opinion otherwise. They would have gained no comfort from the Prime Minister's flippant remark `send me a letter' in response to the questions that they asked him yesterday morning. The policy statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The goal is for Australia to develop internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable wood production and wood products industries.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a worldwide shortage of hardwood products and no lack of markets overseas. Yet with the present uncertainty for the industry, how can we guarantee the continuity of exports?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the other place, according to a statement that I have been given by Mr Anderson and Mr McLachlan, the government voted against allowing a motion moved by the coalition calling for the immediate implementation of the national forest policy. Today the coalition moved in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House, recognising the damage to regional economies and jobs, reaffirms its commitment to the national forest policy statement and requests the government to bring about its immediate implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>None of the five members who have been allegedly going to resign&mdash;they are government members&mdash;have the courage to stand up against the government's strongmen to bring about the implementation of the national forest policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just not good enough. Not only today's effort but also this shameful backdown has been preceded by at least two months of policy backflips by the government. In December 1994 Senator Faulkner advised Mr Beddall of 1,309 coupes and compartments of high conservation value. At the end of December Mr Beddall made his decision, in the week before Christmas&mdash;something like 22 December&mdash;Mr Keating announced the reschedule of the study of existing operations, and on 27 January 1995 Mr Keating identified 511, not 509 as is widely publicised, coupes and compartments for logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another goal announced in the national forest policy statement is to `expand employment opportunities and the skills base of people working in forest management and forest-based industries'. What incentive is there for private enterprise to spend hard-earned capital on value adding equipment when the industry is in such a state of uncertainty? If management plans were implemented, as is advocated in the policy, it is anticipated that they would provide a set of operational requirements for wood harvesting and other commercial and non-commercial uses of forest areas. This would give the industry the certainty it deserves and needs. If the government thinks it is so important, why did it vote against implementing the national forest policy today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor members of the Senate and the House of Representatives who constitute the government have always taken pride in their supposed representation of the working man. Of the senators in this chamber, I would like to detail those senators from the other side of the chamber who were previously trade union members.

Senator Devereux, who was the National President of the Electrical Trades Union, is now sitting on the crossbenches because of his refusal to accept the government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask all of those senators: where do you stand on this question? Why aren't you showing your support for the timber workers? The ACTU has declared its support for the timber industry. Why can't you? The timber industry in this country is alive and well but there must be no loss of jobs while the industry and the government work out a consistent and sustainable policy. For the sake of the timber industry, I hope it is sooner rather than later. </PARA>

Inside there is not the signature of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. No lowly person like him signed this one. There for you to see&mdash;and for Senator Murphy, who is smirking, to see&mdash;is the signature of none other than the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating). The highest elected office holder in Australia has signed this contract, this agreement, alongside all the premiers of Australia, including the former Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence, leader of the disgraced government of Western Australia, fortunately replaced by Mr Court. </PARA>

That is what the Australian Prime Minister's signature is worth; it is worth nothing. He is the highest elected person in the land. </PARA>

I should say `milling companies' because I believe it is a misnomer to call them `woodchipping companies' when you are talking about the public forests. I could not blame millers and woodchippers for carrying on, as I am sure they will when they eventually go away if they get something out of this government&mdash;although, the way things are going, that might take a while&mdash;milling and gathering wood under the basis of the old licences. The only licences which have been taken away are those for exporting woodchips. The rest of the arrangements must stay and the industry can carry on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot blame those people for continuing to woodchip, whether the government is prepared to renew the export licences or not. The only thing they can do if they want to continue chipping the waste material&mdash;I wish we could get through to the Greens that woodchipping comes from waste material and waste material alone&mdash;is continue to do so and make a stockpile. We can watch the mountains of woodchips grow as they chip the part of the logs that can be chipped. I doubt that the mountains of woodchips would ever grow as fast as the mountain of foreign debt that stands at about $150 billion to $160 billion at present. As our pile of woodchips grows, so too will the foreign debt grow. The only time that that mountain of foreign debt and that pile of woodchips will be removed is when this disgraced Labor government is defeated at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Letting a stockpile grow would immediately help to diminish all of the logs currently being wasted and get things going again.

He was fearful of a few greenie lunatic votes going out the door. </PARA>

I do not know whether any of them in other states are being mismanaged, but I do know one thing: the forests of Western Australia are not being mismanaged. If a state government is not managing its forests properly, the federal government should seek out that government, do something to it until it again starts abiding by the agreement that has now been disgraced and then let it have back its licences. But, no, what did Mr Keating do? He took the licences off everyone right around Australia. I do not know whether Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland or the Northern Territory are mismanaging their forests, but I do know that Western Australia is not. Let the Prime Minister find out which states are not managing their forests and give back the licences to the ones that are managing their forests properly. I believe all the states are managing them properly, but this is what happens when there is pressure from the lunatic Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now deal with the economics of this issue. I am not ashamed to admit that I am a dollar man. There has to be a way to make a dollar in any project that I look at, otherwise I will not be in it. The Greens claim, and the government believes them, that beautiful, straight jarrah and karri logs&mdash;I use Western Australian timber as an example&mdash;are being used for woodchipping. I have heard the Greens say that in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With my rural and primary industry background, I know a bit about abattoirs. Our family grows some pretty good prime beef, but I have never known an abattoir to put prime beef into sausages. Has anyone else here known that to happen? If operators of an abattoir did that, they would be foolish. We can compare woodchips to sausages. Woodchips are only by-products from mills, just as sausages are from abattoirs. That is all they are. The lowest quality cuts go into sausages; they same is the case for woodchips. </PARA>

You would have to be an economic fool. I know that the Australian government at present cannot manage its economy, but even it would not manage the economy in that way. You would not use a log that is worth $450 a tonne or prime steak at $15 a kilo to make a by-product. It is as simple as that. That is the simplest economic lesson I could give anyone in this place.

The southern forests of Western Australia alone provide about 1,400 jobs and the industry is worth $50 million. The industry is about 40 per cent karri and 60 per cent jarrah. I know the Western Australian government, the Court government, looks after its forests. I know that forests are managed by people who have a four-year degree in forestry. I also know that it takes four years from the time you first look at a forest for logging to get it ready. I know that there is a ban on logging within 200 metres of either side of a creek, river or whatever. I know that you cannot log where there is more than a 15-degree slope.</PARA></TALK.START>

They work for CALM only; CALM controls them. It is the same case with the dedicated contractors who serve the mills. So private enterprise is not admitted on its own into the public forests of Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let this debate go by without refuting some of the comments that Senator Panizza just made. Certainly a number of statements have been made in recent times. One of the most important ones is that there has been a lot of concern about the national forest policy. It was never an agreement that the conservation movement in Australia was happy with. It is interesting to note that the opposition is now so vehemently defending the national forest strategy when, in fact, part of that national forest strategy includes a moratorium clause&mdash;something which I have not heard anybody from the opposition benches mention.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to the unions involved and the people who are working in the forests in the south-west of Western Australia. They say they do cut down trees that are hundreds of years old, despite the comments from Senator Abetz that they never cut down 400-year-old trees. That is a nonsense statement. It is happening in Western Australia. They actually do not like cutting them down. They call them a name that relates to human excrement because they are not very good for their saw equipment. The loggers do not like cutting them down. They do not use them very much for sawlogs because they have all these dreadfully inconvenient knots and areas in the tree and because they are so old and so valuable as a habitat. </PARA>

I challenge them to talk to the people who have the photographs and can show them the exact age of the tree. I guess they do not know that it is quite easy to age a tree once it has been cut down because of the tree rings. Of course, there is ample photographic evidence that people who are cutting down trees for woodchipping are cutting down trees that are extremely old and that existed long before European settlement in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

They will build walls around a Moreton Bay fig. They will build roads that curve around a Moreton Bay fig. Whilst I have nothing against Moreton Bay figs, I believe there are people in the opposition who have probably helped to save Moreton Bay figs in their own area. But what is the difference between a 100-year-old Moreton Bay fig that was grown by a European settler and a tree which may be in excess of 400 years old and which, in fact, is a very valuable habitat and was around hundreds of years before European settlement? The heritage value, the sheer value of life, of something that has managed to survive, and is still living for hundreds of years after it was originally a seedling, is not replaced by a blue gum plantation or something that is planted in a monoculture or something that is planted simply to provide the basis for sawlogs. </PARA>

If it is absolutely essential to gain access to old-growth forests more than a hundred years after the first access to old-growth forests in Australia, if it is absolutely essential for the industry to survive by continued access to old-growth forest, how on earth can anyone on that bench say that this industry is sustainable? How sustainable is it? How long does it take to grow a tree? Why do you still need access to old-growth forests over a hundred years after the forest industry has commenced operation? How can you call that sustainable? How can you regrow a 400-year-old tree? How can you do that and talk about ecological sustainability? How can you recreate an ecosystem by planting a plantation? If you use land that is being used for farmland currently, if you look at the prospects for agroforestry, if you look at how you can create win-win situations for jobs in the rural and regional areas, then you have the possibility for actually sounding credible in this argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, Senator Cook made a very pathetic attempt at responding to a question in relation to the balance of payments. I would like the members of the opposition bench and also the members of the right wing of the Labor Party&mdash;who, we know, are fighting behind closed doors as strongly as those members of the opposition who are sitting here today&mdash;to actually look closely at the figures that are available, to have the courage to look and see what the actual benefits of this industry to the Australian economy are. I do not mean the actual export figures. I am talking about the actual benefits to Australia's balance of payments. If, as many people are beginning to do, you calculate the industry's high and increasing capital intensity&mdash;and we heard today how we are importing more capital into Australia&mdash;its increasing reliance on imported fuels and other inputs, and its very high level of ownership from overseas sources, you will find that, with the subsidies that are available to this industry, we probably have a negative balance of payments. </PARA>

This does not mean, as Senator Abetz is suggesting, that we put the most environmentally atrocious whacking great pulp mill at Wesley Vale.

Old-growth forest as a living entity means an environmental and ecological resource, a tourist resource, a small industry, a business resource, a service industry resource and accommodation and so on. Every time you destroy an old-growth forest which is the resource for those industries, because of the spread effects which are much higher in those industries which rely on the continuing existence of old-growth forests, then the number of jobs which may be impacted now and in the future is much greater than were ever in chipping and logging for woodchip exports.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The green movement is not after the jobs of the people in the forest industry. Everybody who is willing to look at commonsense will know that these jobs cannot continue in woodchipping for exports because of the fact that Japan will not continue to buy Australian woodchips after markets come on line from other countries. I know that it has been pointed out that a portion of the woodchips from Australia do not go overseas, and that means those jobs, obviously, will continue.

If the opposition does not care about living forests that have been around, sometimes for hundreds of years, if it does not care that the last vestiges of life in those forms are being wiped out for a very temporary profit, say it. The opposition should say, `This is what we care about: we care about the short-term profits; we care about making the industry happy for now; we don't care about the future of even their jobs; we don't care about the future of anybody's job that actually depends on the forests remaining where they are, which is our biggest export job grower.'

That is what you will continue to get if you close your eyes and think, `All we want is to gain continued access to unique ecological resources in this country.' This is what the debate is about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to follow Senator Brownhill's lead and look at the national forest policy itself, we should easily understand that part of the implementation of it is to explain it and accurately describe it to the nation. That, most apparently, has not occurred. That has not been done. The government has failed in that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising, because we have seen time and time again instances where this government thinks it is sufficient to chuck out a few words, to give the people a dose of rhetoric. There is a list of them, starting with that one about no child living in poverty and going down to some of the terminology we see in this national forest policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having chucked out that sort of rhetoric, the government has a track record of sitting back and blaming everybody else when nothing happens. I think it is most apparent that this government has the capacity to enforce its own policy. It could get on and actually do it instead of just saying that it exists and then blaming everybody else for it not occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has the capacity to enforce its own policy and it cannot use the same old excuse all the time and get away with it&mdash;it has not got away with it this time&mdash;that it is the states' fault, that they are supposed to come along and sign something, agree to something or have a discussion, a summit or a COAG meeting. That is a tired excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been advised that it has the corporations power, the export regulations power, the world heritage properties protection act, the Endangered Species Act and the Australian Nature Conservation Agency establishment legislation. The power is there, but where is the will? Where is the will to enforce what it has in its own policy? Those powers could be used to enforce the relevant sections of the national forest policy, yet we see procrastination and deliberate obfuscation. We see the shuffling of responsibility and the finger pointing in any direction but where it belongs&mdash;back to the federal government itself. The government really cannot any longer hide behind the deception that there are others to blame. It has a responsibility to use all of the authorities and opportunities at its disposal. If this policy is so good, let us see it in action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other responsibility the government has is to explain its policies and to define the terms and assumptions upon which its policies are based. I agree with Senator Troeth, who earlier in this debate made a contribution which I thought was quite enlightening. Part of the national forest policy statement says something along the lines, according to her quote, that the Australian community will have a sound understanding and will participate in the decision making. That has demonstrably not occurred. The national forest policy also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . until the assessments are completed, forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>That was signed by all states. What do we see happening? We see Senator Faulkner recommending, rightly or wrongly&mdash;that is not the dispute at the moment&mdash;approximately 1,300 areas that had old growth forest or wilderness value and we see him being ignored. The Prime Minister, on another occasion and for other reasons, set aside 509 or 511 coupes&mdash;it does not really matter&mdash;as having high conservation wilderness value and the state governments of Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales are ignoring that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the federal government blaming the states for not coming to the party with this policy. We have the states signing something and then we have them walking away from their own signatures. In fact, it seems that the unions and the Tasmanian and Victorian governments are saying that they will target some of those areas as a matter of priority. They are saying that they will target old growth and wilderness forests. What sort of government is that? It is not responsible government; it is feral government. There is no other way of describing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of determination that you see in children. If they cannot have their lollies as they want, you see them throwing them away so nobody else can have them. You see them doing all sorts of childish things, out of control, when their initial desires are denied. We are told that these people&mdash;they are proud of the announcement&mdash;will speed up the utter desecration of our unique and precious forest. It is a crying shame and an international disgrace, and we should not allow such people to be in govern ment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have demonstrated already that the national forest policy statement is a worthless document. The government does not want to implement it. The states that signed it want to do something else in defiance of it. They are flagrantly disobeying its conservation intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The silly thing about it is that, properly enforced, the national forest policy statement would in fact be a sort of resource security on the sly. Here we have the government, which was so hell-bent on establishing that process, and some of the state governments that thought it was such a good idea disobeying that very policy which could bring about their much wanted direction of a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy itself is industry oriented and the process is to create regional forestry agreements. It would effectively guarantee supply. We should guarantee supply to sustainable, viable and vital industry, but we do not really know whether that is what we have got. Parts of this industry could be viable, vital, lively and useful. Other parts are patently not. They cannot be continued. They are not sustainable and we do not really know where they fit. We have various contentions and assertions about the value of various sectors of the industry, but we do not have the information. We are told with various degrees of accuracy of the level of export income that we receive from woodchips, but we do not really know because the government has not taken the proper responsibility to properly define exactly how much of those exports are obtained from what is really waste material and what is obtained in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are great problems in the definitional side of this whole national forest policy statement and its translation on the ground in the bush. We do not really know enough about this to be debating in a fully informed way. The debate has degenerated into sloganism and into mutual insult sessions. We need the government to show the leadership, to properly define the terms we use for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really is `sustainable'? Is `sustainable' using up the forests as fast as humanly possible while putting the country into debt and adding to environmental damage? Is it sustainable to wilfully ignore parts of the national forestry policy statement and emphasise others? Is it sustainable to propose to exploit these coupes while possible in flagrant disregard of what has already been signed by states?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a contribution to this debate about sustainability. A recent report released by Dr Andrew Dragun, senior lecturer in law, economics and public policy at La Trobe University, found that the Victorian government directly spent $90 million on logging for a return of $40 million. In other words, the Victorian taxpayer subsidised the industry to the tune of $50 million a year. Dr Dragun goes further and suggests that when all of the costs are taken into account, a more reasonable estimate of the annual subsidy could be of the order of $385 million. That is a contribution to the debate. I would like to see the dispute to that or see other suggestions which challenge or confirm. I think we need to be debating exactly what is meant by these terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know some of the facts. We have seen them displayed over the years. The combined debts of all the forestry commissions&mdash;I say commissions; it is not a mistake for the corporations that exist in some other states&mdash;which operated over a number of years is $5 billion or so. That amount consists of debts as follows: Queensland, $1.666 billion; New South Wales, $1.121 billion; Victoria, $1.178 billion; Tasmania, $565 million; and Western Australia $481 million. Only South Australia ever operated a profitable forestry service. It is not surprising that South Australia's debt is so low. Ninety per cent of its sawlogs are sourced from softwood plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consulting economist Mr Francis Grey has identified 23 types of effective subsidy to the industry, which could include things like low royalties, state government subsidies, possible exemptions, roading, various infrastructure, port facilities, forestry commissions, not paying monitoring fees, diesel subsidies and others. There are also accusations of rorts and efficiencies that I will not go into now. I have told parliament previously about these sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes good economic sense to keep our native forests intact. Senator Margetts has explored that area quite considerably. Not only do they provide a habitat for endangered species&mdash;and I am reminded here of an instance that Senator Coulter reminded me of earlier today. He visited an area near the Tantawangalo forest in south-east New South Wales from which 22,000 koalas had been shot and removed in the 1920s. Obviously that was an area of koala habitat which was extensive and successful and had got to the stage where the population was quite intense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the New South Wales Forestry Commission did not define that area as a koala habitat because there were no koalas there. Obviously there was no examination of the degree of suitability of the habitat. It was a koala habitat; it had been a successful koala habitat. It would obviously suit koalas in the future. When we mention koalas we often do it in a offhand way, but I am talking about a national icon; I am talking about one of Australia's symbols. If we remove its habitat because we are incapable of recognising what its habitat is then eventually we do not have koalas. If we remove them, we remove part of Australia. Our native forests in an intact condition provide a habitat for endangered species. The other function of such places is that they store greenhouse gases, they hold soil together and provide organic matter for the forest itself in its own process of sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a source of clean water. A hectare of old-growth mountain ash clear felled may produce $270 worth of woodchips once and a generation later it may produce half as much because regrowth is not so dense. Consulting economist Read Sturgess and Associates was commissioned by the Victorian government to examine this matter and found that if that same hectare was left unlogged it would produce more than $6,000 worth of water in Victoria and it would do that year after year. So with these things in mind it is really not surprising that the softwood market is steadily increasing because there are people who recognise the value of our native forests, that it is important to reserve those areas and to challenge the previously accepted wisdoms of there being an endless opportunity to exploit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are reminded&mdash;and I know this has been quoted before, but I will quote it again because it suits me to do so now&mdash;that Mr de Bruin of the SEAS Sapfor, which is and we should recognise it as one of the largest softwood companies, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>, `We're expecting a substantial increase in available plantation resources over the next three or four years. We'll get to stage where we virtually don't have to log native forests at all in the next two to five years.' That is the trend. That is where the industry is going and those who are intending to make a real profit out of it recognise it. We should also be encouraging it to go. Companies such as CSR are recognising that and are heavily investing in plantations as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend that native forest logging&mdash;and this is where I started this section, on the definition of sustainable&mdash;is not sustainable; it cannot be continued forever. The sooner we recognise it the better. It is costing us money and destroying the environment. If we are going to interpret the national forest policy statement properly, we really need proper debate about what is sustainable, what is profitable and what is waste. We need these terms properly defined by government if the government is sincere about its efforts to implement its own policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I question that sincerity because the national forest policy statement also contains a promise to have a representative, comprehensive&mdash;it would be comprehensible too, I would hope&mdash;and an adequate reserve system in place by the end of this year, and it has not even set one area aside yet. I pointed this out some time ago to the government. Even the area in Tasmania&mdash;and I am sure the parliamentary secretary at table is well aware of this, but some other honourable senators in the chamber may not be&mdash;that contains the world's longest living organism on the planet, a Huon pine 10,500 years old, has not even been set aside. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One point that Senator Bell raised in respect of the national forest policy statement I will comment on now. I can assure Senator Bell and the Senate that the government is very determined to implement the national forest policy statement, and not just because of the current controversy we are faced with. I would reject any assertion that we do not want to implement it. Even Senator Bell would have to acknowledge that it is not just because of but certainly in part because of the current controversy that is occurring that it is very necessary to vigorously pursue all of the goals and objectives set out in the NFPS, and I will come to  those in detail shortly. </PARA>

I do want to respond to a couple of the issues she touched on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts alleges that the only area of the woodchip licences this federal government and state governments care about is the dollar value. That is clearly an incorrect assertion. I know that at state government level&mdash;and I am referring to all state governments; currently there are conservative governments in most states&mdash;prior to a Liberal government in Tasmania and prior to a Liberal government in Victoria, the policies of both former Premier Field and former Premier Kirner are being continued by the current conservative governments. Those policies are not just dollar driven; they are driven by a combined set of values applying to their forest industries, based on assessing the conservation values of the forests in those two states. They have an appropriately balanced set of values that they are attempting to implement at their state levels. It is not simply dollar driven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area the federal government has to rely, to a significant degree, on advice from the states. That is because within our department we do not have the significant number of people necessary to carry out the assessments in the detail in which the states can obviously carry them out. As has already been pointed out&mdash;I think, fairly frequently&mdash;the federal government's power in this area is in respect of woodchip export licences. But through a cooperative approach with the state governments, we have developed the national forest policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts refers to the problem with the balance of payments. She asserts that the woodchip export industry is a net drain on the balance of payments. As Senator Cook said in his response at question time, it is very hard to separate out the contribution of the woodchip export area from the other sectors of the industry because it is an integrated industry. When you log an area, a `coupe'&mdash;and I think that is a word that is entering into everyone's everyday usage, given the run it is getting at the moment&mdash;depending on the quality of timber in that area, there is a significant amount of waste. There are a number of options: you can chip it; you can use those chips domestically or for export purposes; and, other than putting them in pulp and paper, you can also put them in MDF plants and produce particle boards&mdash;and that is a very significant area of expansion of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the issue of the balance of payments. Frankly, it does shock me that in the last financial year we exported over $450 million worth of woodchips; I wish that did not occur. I would much rather see those woodchips processed and downstreamed into a greater value added product in this country, whether it is pulp and paper or whether it is to a particle board mill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would remind Senator Margetts&mdash;and this is another point she made&mdash;that you need a pulp and paper mill to do that. I do not know of any site in Australia that the Green movement accepts as an appropriate location for a pulp and paper mill. The Greens have not named one. All they will do is continue to talk about so-called backyard boutique pulp and paper mills. The problem is that, at least at the present time, they are not economically viable. No-one is proposing to build any in Australia. Surely we have to be economically rational, at least to some extent, about what is required. If you look at pulp and paper mills around the world, they are very capital intensive. If we are going to go down that track, then at the least we do need a pulp and paper mill that is viable on a world scale and will undoubtedly be technologically rich. Also with the various other forms of downstreaming, I certainly believe that, under the processes involved in the national forest policy statement, we can downstream much better than we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the quarterly forest product statistics for the September quarter of last year, I remind the Senate that we imported&mdash;and I am shocked by what we import into this country&mdash;$144 million of newsprint, $731 million of printing and writing paper, and $370 million of packaging and industrial paper. They are shocking statistics, showing that we export over $400 million of woodchips and import this other product. These figures do not include the statistics on furniture:  I understand that some hundreds of millions of dollars of furniture made from wood products are imported into the country. If we were able to convert those woodchips into the value added products that we are importing&mdash;and at the moment, I think the deficit is $1.7 billion a year&mdash;we would become a net exporter, not a net importer. That is the sort of industry approach that we in government can encourage under the national forest policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the environment movement approaches this issue purely from the point of view of criticising woodchip exports. It is a fairly shrewd way&mdash;at least from their point of view&mdash;of attacking all logging in all native forests. I think one of the goals of the national forest policy statement is to ensure that we reach a balance between the competing uses of our forests. We must ensure that an appropriate range of our forests is set aside for conservation. In many areas an appropriate level of forests must be set aside for wood production and industry development that is sustainable. We should ensure that where such development occurs it is carried out in an environmentally responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on pine plantations. Senator Margetts was just a touch cautious about pushing that as an issue, even though she did raise it as one of the solutions. I think pine plantations have a place in the development of a sustainable forest industry. But I notice that in New Zealand, the Greenpeace organisation is campaigning vigorously against them and demanding that they be ripped out of the ground. Why? A pine plantation, if any of you have been into one, is an ecological desert for native flora and fauna. For obvious reasons, you will not find too much Australian flora and fauna in a pine plantation. Pines are not native to Australia. The biology of pines precludes or minimises the growth of any other Australian species. Therefore, I do not want to see pine plantations from one end of Australia&mdash;or Tasmania&mdash;to the other. I think that would be an inappropriate way to head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter and Senator Bell talked about the debts of the forestry commissions. Certainly Senator Coulter referred to the debt of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission&mdash;or what was known as the Forestry Commission&mdash;of $400 million. I think the important thing is that, since then, the processes have been changed in Tasmania, and the administration of forestry is carried out on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do want to point out one aspect of the debt in Tasmania&mdash;and Senator Bell should be aware of this. The Forestry Commission in Tasmania was used as one of those hollow logs by the Gray government to pay a dividend, from the Forestry Commission to the state government, of over $10 million a year&mdash;I think that figure is correct&mdash;in terms of a notional profit that did not exist. It did that in order to make sure that, when it was entering into its borrowing requirements, no-one saw the debt levels. It did not have a lot to do with a debt for forestry development; it had a lot to do with using a fairly imaginative financial hollow log in order that former Premier Gray could continue to incur the unsustainable levels of financial expenditure that he was incurring while he was Premier. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one other point, about Senator Bell's referral to Mr de Bruin and his projections about where the industry should be going. Senator Bell conveniently skates over the fact that Mr de Bruin is a major importer of timber into this country. He obviously makes a profit out of it. I think Senator Bell used the words, `Mr de Bruin wants to make a real profit out of it.' He certainly does. He stands to be a major gainer from the importation of timber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be interesting to see from which countries Mr de Bruin&mdash;the expert whom you are quoting&mdash;is taking the timber and what forestry methods are being used in those countries. I know that the forestry practices in Thailand, Brazil or wherever are absolutely outrageous. They are not sustainable in any sense. Before the Democrats and the Greens quote Mr de Bruin more widely, I think they should investigate where he is importing his timbers from. I think it would embarrass them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud of the fact that we have a tree in Tasmania&mdash;the Huon pine&mdash;that has recently been publicly exposed as being more than 10,500 years old. I do not think anyone in this place or anywhere else would seriously suggest that that tree, now that it has been publicly announced, should not be protected to the maximum degree and in the appropriate way. I do not think you can seriously expect the federal government, having learnt one week about the tree, to rush in and have a national park or World Heritage area declared the following week. I do not think you can seriously suggest that, Senator Bell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a considerable controversy raging at the present time about woodchipping and also about the broader forest industries in this country. The federal government&mdash;with its limited powers that I have referred to&mdash;entered in a realistic way into negotiations with all the state governments about the forest issue approximately 3 1/2 years ago, and the national forest policy statement emerged. The statement has not been signed yet by Premier Groom from Tasmania, but I understand that it is in the process of being signed. He has sent it up, but he has qualified it a little bit. That, hopefully, will be resolved shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do require the considerable cooperation not just of the state governments&mdash;because I think we have to be critical of the state governments in their approach to the NFPS&mdash;but also of industry. I frankly do not think industry has been forward looking enough in some areas&mdash;for example, looking at and developing downstreaming of our extensive woodchip resource. It is going to require the cooperation of not just the federal government&mdash;and I think it is unfair to blame the federal government in that way&mdash;but also of the state governments and industry in order to ensure the rigorous implementation of the national forest policy statement. </PARA>

It is appropriate that his role is to advance those interests and concerns within the context of this statement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I do not always agree with what Senator Bell says, at least I thought his argument today was rational, which is more than can be said for Senator Margetts, who raved on for 20 minutes about 400-year-old trees. What she did not say was that in my state of Tasmania&mdash;I do not know what happens in Western Australia&mdash;something like 70 per cent of the state is locked up. I think it is fair to say that, not just in Tasmania but in most parts of Australia, more trees are damaged by fire, wind, hurricanes and gales than will ever be damaged by a living and sustainable forest industry, which we have got down there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are debating today is this fine motion brought forward by my colleague Senator Brownhill and the mess that this Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has got us into. Is it any wonder that outside this parliament we have ordinary men, women and children staging one of the largest demonstrations and protests ever seen in Canberra? Is it any wonder that these thousands of decent Australians and hundreds and hundreds of thousands more like them have finally stood up and said, `Enough is enough'? Is it any wonder that they are upset because this government is threatening their jobs, their livelihood, their families and indeed their very survival?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This national forest statement is not a blueprint for the future management of our forestry resource. It is instead final proof that the Labor government has sold out to the radical green agenda regardless of the cost. The national forest statement was supposed to be based on rational, scientific evidence, but to date we have seen very little, if any, evidence of that. All we seem to have seen is evidence of Natalie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this was supposed to be an objective assessment, then why did the minister for the environment pay conservation groups to make their own wish list? What we ended up with were the darkest of green conservation groups roaming the bush, paid for by the minister, trying to identify every coupe they could find as being suitable for conservation. Those conservation groups must have thought it was Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if that was not enough, then the minister placed the final outcome into the hands of the Environment Protection Agency, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the World Heritage and Biodiversity Branch and the Environmental Resources Information Network in his directorate. When all these groups had had their say, what was left? I will tell you what was left. What this government ended up with was a farce&mdash;a document which lacked any credibility. You do not have to take my word for it. The federal Labor member for Lyons, Mr Dick Adams, is on record as saying that the process which arrived at the decision `did not have a lot of integrity'. Is it any wonder when we have a Prime Minister who ably displayed his lack of knowledge of forestry issues by describing a coupe as an area of 150 metres square. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our minister for the environment is not much better. We heard in this place only yesterday that he wrote to the Victorian Minister for Conservation and Natural Resources, Geoff Coleman, telling him that a shining gum was a nationally rare plant. We might well ask what criteria the minister uses when considering such a listing, especially when there are thousands of hectares of forest in Victoria containing this species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what happens when a minister losses control of his portfolio. We have seen that this week. This is what happens when a minister allows himself to be dictated to by the bureaucrats in his department who are obviously running their own agenda. My own state of Tasmania is a classic example of how bungled this whole process has been. When the minister for the environment originally announced a national list of 1,800 coupes which were to be protected, 85 per cent of the 170 listed in Tasmania had either been harvested previously or had roads built through them or to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) intervened we had a new list of 509 coupes&mdash;Senator Crane told me today it was actually 511. This new list has no more credibility than the first. At least two of the 72 coupes on the latest list have already been clear-felled. In addition, 50 others had either been logged previously or are being logged now. To make matters worse&mdash;if they could be any worse&mdash;two-thirds of the coupes on the list are not even in the National Estate and a further three are in private forests. This national forest policy statement must be rejected and it must be rejected outright. What this statement attempts to do is to lock away forever a valuable resource which it has been proven, time and time again, can be responsibly managed for forestry operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are these people who have come to Parliament House so angry? We have to ask ourselves that question. Why do they feel betrayed by the government and the entire farce of a process which has resulted in this statement? I will tell you why they are angry? They are angry because the government has broken every promise it ever made to the forestry workers in this country. They are angry because no-one in the government is prepared to stand up and be counted on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the voices of anger from the government members and senators? There are no voices of anger because the people in the government who should be standing tall, like Senator Murphy, have rolled over. They are nowhere to be seen. I look forward to hearing what Senator Murphy has to say because we know that he is a member of the CFMEU and the Australian Timber Workers Union. We know that Senator Sherry is a member of the Federated Liquor and Allied Trades Union. Why have you deserted your union mates? You have turned your backs on your old friends. I read in the paper today that Silvia Smith, Harry Quick and Dick Adams have supposedly threatened to resign. Do you believe that? I don't. I think it is just another excuse for a headline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have let down Tasmania's timber workers because, at the end of the day, you have shown that in the Labor Party it is more important to keep in sweet with the Prime Minister than it is to stand up for the people who need you. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I do not know how you will face your old mates. I can tell you that amongst the timber workers in Tasmania your names are mud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this statement will do, if it is allowed to remain, is change forever the balance in relation to forestry matters. It does that because this document not only moves the goalposts but also changes the whole game. The only areas which this statement and this minister are prepared to exclude from the definition of old-growth forest are those areas, by his own definition, which have been clear-felled over the last 20 years for integrated sawlog and woodchip operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that this new definition that is supported by the radical green movement and the minister has resulted in the farce we have today. What it quite clearly means is that, accordingly to the new rules, the areas which have been traditionally available for harvesting and regeneration are now off-limits. It creates a ridiculous position where plantations can now be considered under his definition as old-growth forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time the government took a long hard look at the position which it has allowed the radical green movement to put it in. Members of the government need to take a walk outside Parliament House and see the people and the families who are going to be the big losers. Let us try to explain to them why these areas, which have been traditionally available, are now to be locked away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you really want proof of how responsibly the forest industries have managed their operations, it is there in front of you. If the government and the radical green movement are now prepared to list previously logged areas as old-growth, then surely that is proof that the forests can recover. Personally, I believe that there is no better example than that that regeneration can and does work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This national forest policy statement has sent a clear message overseas that this government does not want investment. This government is not about encouraging the valuable downstream processing that will be so important in stimulating jobs growth. How will Australia ever be able to participate in downstream processing when every forest which is over 20 years of age is going to be off limits? For the sake of future generations of Australians, this statement must be rejected outright.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot leave the Greens or the Democrats out of this opportunistic approach either. They chose to come in here and talk about a bloke in South Australia who runs a pine sawmill, Mr de Bruin. Of course, the Liberals are not too happy with him either. He was also very opportunistic in this debate because he was seeking greater market share for the pine industry. Dishonest as it was, that is what he was about. I would like to read from a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> debate in the Victorian parliament with respect to Mr de Bruin and his company. It demonstrates just how much credibility he really has. This statement was made by Mr Weideman, the member for Frankston. Mr Weideman, who is a Liberal member, referred to Mr de Bruin and SEAS Sapfor. He referred to something that SEAS Sapfor did which was very dishonest. His comments draw some attention to the company and that person. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding is that SEAS Sapfor Limited had a company called Timber Sales distributing its wood and timber products. A year or so ago it was brought to my attention that in Dandenong the company was treating pine sawlogs with arsenic and creosote. My understanding is that the property was sold. Local residents and the Environment Protection Authority were concerned the property was contaminated. The property was sold as being chemical free, which caused concern to one or two of my constituents who are worried about conservation issues.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that it was not contamination free. It is also worth noting that Mr de Bruin, who is now the head of SEAS Sapfor in South Australia, was at some point in time involved in Poseidon Minerals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill's motion demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the national forest policy statement; otherwise we would not have this motion.

I would have thought that, given the circumstances that exist outside Parliament House and given the opportunity that some of you on the other side have had, you would have at least gone and got yourselves a copy of the national forest policy statement and did a little bit of reading. You would at least have some understanding of what this is all about and how you go about implementing it.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Australian Constitution, State Governments have primary responsibility for land use decision making and management.

Several States are introducing changes to increase opportunities for consultation, to reflect changes in societal values, and to promote more effective State-Commonwealth cooperation in land use decision making.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in part what it says about intergovernmental arrangements on land use decision making. It also refers to the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment provides for the identification of the interests of both the Commonwealth and State Governments in land use decision making.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has a number of obligations. You people are confused about the issue of woodchip licences versus the implementation of the national forest policy statement.

<PARA>The point I want to make is this: yes, the Commonwealth has had a national forest policy statement for two years, but not once in that two-year period has it received anything from any state. You obviously do not listen to anything the Prime Minister says; he said this back on 22 December. In the two years that the national forest policy statement has been in place and signed by all of the states with the exception of Tasmania, not one of those states has written to the Commonwealth to invite it to participate in the process of getting in place a comprehensive regional assessment to then put in place a regional forest agreement. You may know this, but it will be the only process that will bring both security and stability for the industry and long-term protection for the environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have been in this process for four days it seems strange that you are waving bits of paper over there. You might get an opportunity to table them later. Nevertheless, it is farcical for us to get involved in debates on motions of no consequence that can make no contribution to either resolving the circumstances that currently exist over the issue of woodchip licences or to getting a quicker implementation of the national forest policy statement. This motion, along with the amendment, should be opposed for the very reasons I have just outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I encourage the opposition, including Senator Boswell, to read the national forest policy statement and then encourage those Premiers to get to work and invite this Commonwealth to participate in the process of comprehensive regional assessments that will lead to regional forest agreements&mdash;which I totally support&mdash;to greater security and to the greatest ability for the forest industries around this country. They have a marvellous contribution to make to the economy, but they need to be better run. We need to get better social and economic returns out of them. That will be part of this process also. The state Premiers around the place have signed off on it so it is really a matter of getting on and getting it done and opposing this motion. As I said, it serves no purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating Senator Brownhill's motion on the mess that the present Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has got us into. Senator Faulkner can be described as the minister for rigorous assessments because it is the rigorous assessment that he has gone through which has declared the 1,300 areas of high conservation value. Clearly from what we have heard this week and before, the assessments have been a complete charade. Worst of all, legitimate environmental questions which concern forest management have been completely demeaned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a fair bit of media speculation today that Senator Faulkner has been called off the job and the job has been given to Senator Collins. It is interesting that the main government speaker was the parliamentary secretary to the minister for agriculture, Senator Sherry, who filibustered and wasted a lot of time here this afternoon. Clearly, the job is just too big for Senator Faulkner. He has made a complete sham of the process of evaluating the high value conservation forests. He has destroyed the credibility of the procedure, which I might add is a procedure that the government itself has made. He has put at risk thousands of jobs of average Australian workers, the communities that they come from and the enormous amounts of infrastructure that the forest industry and timber industry support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone had any doubt about the feeling that people have about this issue, they should have been outside federal Parliament House at lunchtime today to see thoroughly decent average working Australian men and women, people who are not only involved in the timber industry directly but in others as well, protesting in Canberra about the things that they hold very dear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a fair bit of evidence of the demeaning process that has gone on by the minister. First and foremost&mdash;and there are a number of bits of evidence of this&mdash;at least five coupes or compartments in Victoria do not exist. Originally we were told there were 509 compartments. There are actually 511. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are particular compartments on which the evidence shows that the government did not ever do its work. I give the example of compartment 2329 in the Glenbog state forest. The first half was logged in 1977, a part selectively logged in 1984 and there has been selective logging from the 1920s to the 1970s. It has been thinned twice, part-cleared for highway construction and it has been included as an area that has high conservation value. The only person who could think that would be Senator Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have evidence that 50 coupes were secretly and randomly transferred last week from Tasmania to Victoria. I should put on record that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) apparently thinks that a coupe is approximately 150 square metres. He said that on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> the other day. That area is about the size of his Woollahra house. A coupe actually is about 40 hectares. Minister Faulkner signed a letter to the Victorian minister responsible for forests in which he described&mdash;although with the Latin name&mdash;the shiny gum as being potentially an endangered species. When I heard that, I concluded that the only endangered species are timber workers and their families because Senator Faulkner has been the recipient of incompetent advice from his department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the evidence of Natalie and others who advised on the high conservation value. We had $120,000 of taxpayers' money paid to special interest groups that were favourable to the minister's agenda. We know about Mr Toyne and his agenda. He wishes the whole of the south-east to be declared wilderness and therefore to be closed down and not be available at all for logging. Pretty clearly, the whole evaluation process has been highly political, directed by political forces favourable to the left-wing minister. It really is another whiteboard affair&mdash;a complete pandering to special interest groups. Finally, the government's failure has resulted in the crude use of the export power to manipulate the industry and win the green vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I had the opportunity to go outside today to speak with the families and citizens of Bega, Bombala, Eden and beyond, where schools have been closed and businesses have closed for the day, I met a tugboat operator from Eden, a supermarket manager, a minister of religion&mdash;a whole range of people who are concerned about their towns and communities. This really is a disgraceful, shameful and unAustralian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government backbench knows what should be done. Five members, then six and, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times </EMPHASIS>today, now 14 members, have warned the Prime Minister that the government has to change its course. I guess if they all resigned, as John Devereux has done, we would all be in government this time next week. The caucus resolution was that the 509 coupes should be allowed to be logged until their conservation value is established. Pretty clearly, that is the right decision. But whilst the caucus might talk tough, it did not take a tough decision when given the opportunity in the other place today. The coalition moved a motion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House, recognising the damage to regional economies and jobs, reaffirms its commitment to the national forest policy statement and requests the government to bring about its immediate implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>Those members of the government who were very worried about their electorates and knew what the right decision was, failed to support that motion. It was a motion to make the federal government set out the criteria for the evaluation of high conservation areas. We want that. We saw the government members who had the chance to support their electorates, workers and timber industry communities walk away from their timber workers. This uncertainty is causing a great number of concerns not only amongst timber workers and their communities but amongst the companies involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Harris-Daishowa, a company that Senator Loosley knows a great deal about, has said publicly that its investment program is very much at risk. Hundreds of smaller independent mills have been affected. Whittakers, the second largest sawmiller in Western Australia, has voluntarily had its shares suspended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have become an international laughing stock on this issue, especially as yesterday the current account deficit came out at $2.4 billion. This was the December figure, but it is a record figure&mdash;worse than the September 1991 figure. The current account deficit is moving from the budgeted $18 billion to $26 billion this year. Since this government has been in power, the net foreign debt has gone from $21 billion to $180 billion, which is $10,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating talks admirably about nationalism, our national identity and sovereignty. I put it to him, and to the government, that the two greatest threats to our national identity and sovereignty will be the IMF or his blatant and unacceptable use of the external affairs power, both of which will have much more effect on questions of our independence than his rewriting of history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is not about woodchips; it is about access to public native forests. Senator Faulkner and some Green groups would have us believe that timber workers are clear-felling thousands of hectares of forests, purportedly at high conservation value, for woodchips. Let us look at the facts on a per tonne basis. Woodchips are worth $85 to a sawmiller. This compares with $200 per cubic metre for inferior sawn timber, $800 per cubic metre for dried structural products and $2,500 for furniture quality timber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many excellent recommendations in the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's participation in peacekeeping</EMPHASIS>. The committee has embraced the fundamental importance of involving local non-government agencies to ensure the success of a peacekeeping mission. It has hence made some important recommendations to involve members of non-government organisations in training and post-employment briefings in recognising their function in the field and enhancing cooperation and liaison with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many honourable senators would know, NGOs are usually in a troubled country for a long time working closely with the local people before and after a conflict. They are in it for the long haul, and they often have the local knowledge and experience of the conflict resolution methods of the indigenous people which can be utilised by peacekeeping forces. This cultural and human rights training that NGOs have should be passed on to peacekeeping troops before they set foot in a country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has heralded some policy changes with regard to proper coordination between not only peacekeepers and NGOs but also other civilian participants, such as the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Electoral Commission. Recommendation 23 advocates the establishment of a permanent peacekeeping policy and operations body which would coordinate the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the AEC, the AFP and the NGOs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recognition of civilian functions is also well exemplified in recommendation 3, which seeks to place representative civilians in the United Nations headquarters and in peacekeeping missions. This would be part of our longer term vision of seeing a permanent full-time command and control operations centre and strategic headquarters in the United Nations to coordinate peacekeeping missions between the many different international participants, and that is in recommendations 11 and 15. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has the opportunity to work productively for this proposal during the current debates on restructuring the United Nations in the year of the United Nations' 50th anniversary. This is a critical debate we need to have if the world community is serious about providing quick and even-handed peacekeeping responses to violence, genocide and war in other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present situation is that the limitations on United Nations resources and its accrued debts from the United States have in the past crippled the organisation's effectiveness. This proposal for a strategic peacekeeping headquarters and command and control centre will only cost more. We may have to address some of the United Nations' fundamental funding problems first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some problems in this report, however, which I would like to address. In my opinion this report has not amply demonstrated the inconsistencies between defence policies and practices and our new peacekeeping commitments, nor does it suggest measures to bring them into line. A further concern is how we will go about managing a budget for contributions to peacekeeping operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of our broader defence strategies, peacekeeping has a role in both our third and fourth pillars of Australian defence, which are regional security and international security. Our work in these efforts contributes to preventing a transformation of conflict into war and aims to address the roots of conflict, which are important measures for Australia's immediate defence. It is therefore alarming that our peacekeeping efforts, which embody both the strategies employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence, can be at odds with our current defence department policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current defence policy is centred around defence self-reliance, which is dependent on commercialisation and exporting services and equipment to be self-sustaining. However, the promotion of arms sales in our region has the effect of fuelling internal conflicts or bilateral tensions and actually works to destabilise our region. The idea that somehow our arms sales contribute to others' security and, hence, our own is contradictory in terms. We plan our own defence priorities with regard to immediate defence needs based on capability, not threat, and our arms sales and technology transfer to countries enhance their capabilities, even if they are not yet a defined external threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy has two ramifications for our peacekeeping efforts. It directly works against methods of bringing warring or potentially warring parties into peaceful negotiation. It also displays a large opportunity cost of resources and efforts that could otherwise go into peacekeeping efforts which would enhance regional and international security and, in turn, lessen demands on the defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peacekeeping embodies a range of efforts from preventive deployment to peace enforcement, with the responsibility shared by the departments of foreign affairs and defence. Peacekeeping itself is not just a military activity and has civilian components such as the Australian Federal Police as law enforcers and the Australian Electoral Commission to oversee and help conduct elections, for example. However, the military component is the most expensive of the peacekeeping efforts and accrues many training and equipment testing benefits that defence could not experience, other than being in the field during peacekeeping activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has not adequately addressed how we will go about paying for peacekeeping activities in the future. This is a necessary part of any policy commitment. It is certain that peacekeeping demands are going to be more demanding in the future, and we have to start planning for them now. The current situation of an increasing gap between rich and poor nations, and between the rich and poor in nations, in our current globalisation trade policy means that it is inevitable that many conflicts which come out as ethnic conflicts will have originated as a result of economic conflicts and increasing gaps in opportunity within countries. Therefore, we need to set a realistic budget for peacekeeping and organise an accountable budget management plan for use in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence is the main component of peacekeeping operations and makes the decision whether or not we support international peacekeeping operations, what resources and capabilities we devote to an exercise and how we use them. However, this report concurs with the Department of Defence, which should not have to commit its own resources to it. On the other hand, contributing organisations such as the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Electoral Commission are expected to be responsible for their own resources committed to overseas operations, subject to supplementation, yet they may not have the power to make the decision to commit in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peacekeeping operations are difficult to plan for and when a budget is set for peacekeeping it must take into account the post-deployment assistance that goes with it. This includes a post-military commitment, civilian infrastructure, law and order and de-mining operations, for example. This is one of our recommendations, set out in recommendation 47. The majority report recommends that `the government examine the feasibility of allocating an annual amount for peacekeeping'. That is in recommendation 22. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How that funding is administered will be crucial and accountability must be paramount. It should not be seen as an open cheque providing funding to every activity that could be grouped under peacekeeping, as this would no doubt lead to inefficiency in expenditure, possibly overspending and a lack of government accountability. Department of Finance approval should be required for each request for additional finance. This would be the only way of keeping down expenditure and offering a satisfactory level of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important for Defence to own peacekeeping and to take responsibility for it. It is important for it to plan for peacekeeping missions within its own force structure planning, policy making resources devoted to equipment and training. It is important for the maintenance of readiness for peacekeeping missions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The separate budget account for peacekeeping can then be used to supplement for the extra costs of peacekeeping missions that are unplanned. In terms of policy making, it is important for Defence to accept responsibility for peacekeeping in order to maintain consistency in its policy making and policy operations, and to coordinate this with other aspects of its long-term defence strategy. Without this occurring, the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to work against each other, and defence policies will continue to work against our international and regional interests. We need to work together if we are to instigate peace in other nations and keep the peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a very frightening thing if a de facto world government becomes the World Trade Organisation and the United Nations becomes the enforcing de facto body for that in terms of regional insecurities that come from this economic destabilisation. I hope that Australia does not jump on that bandwagon and that we think very carefully about the implications for peacekeeping and whether or not we are using our resources in the best way as a preventative diplomacy in peacemaking rather than peacekeeping. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this report the committee reflects the evidence given at public hearings and in some of the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to underline that because I believe that this report, as far as it goes, is useful but it does not go far enough. I want to underline the fact that the interim report reflects very much the evidence given by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In fact, I believe that this interim report is weighted far too heavily in the direction of the evidence which they gave. I want to underline the rest of this paragraph which says that most of the submissions lodged with the committee have been critical of the impact of the assets test on farming families. I would hope that the final report reflects far more closely the evidence given by many farming families and peak farming bodies, rather than simply accepting the argument of the Department of Social Security and DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation was concerned yesterday that those farmers who qualify under the drought relief package to have exemptions from the assets test should in fact be taking up that option. There are some who have taken it up, but, along with the National Farmers Federation, I would certainly urge those farmers who do qualify for that limited availability under that drought package to apply. I hope that we will see at least those farmers having the ability to take advantage of what is offered in the drought package. While I welcome this report, I want to place on record the fact that the final report will need to emphasise far more closely the evidence given by many farming families and farming peak bodies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The rural adjustment, rural debt and rural reconstruction report, which was published in December last year, has been widely circulated and widely acclaimed. That is a significant achievement, given the highly charged atmosphere in which many of the hearings were held and under which many submissions were written. The committee received some 300 submissions, which indicates the interest in the issue. It attracted a great deal of interest at the time, and the hardship and heartbreak was brought to our committee. Obviously, these issues continue to attract a lot of concern by people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect in the report that has not received much attention but which needs to be aired is that of rural debt and how the committee approached this issue. It has been suggested that the committee did not address sufficient time to this aspect of RAS. On the contrary, the question of debt pervaded every aspect of the report. The extent and the impact of debt in rural Australia was probably best described in the submission from the Australian Conference of Leaders of Religious Institutes. Representatives from ACLRI also gave evidence in Sydney. They have had extensive experience in dealing with farm families, with banks, with financial counsellors and as mediators with all those groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the submission that best put the question of debt into perspective was from ABARE, which suggested that debt was not of itself necessarily a limiting factor. ABARE stated that the wheat and other crop industries have the highest average debt and the lowest average equity, yet also have recorded the highest rate of return. The key factor to debt is the ability to service that debt. Within the economic framework of the last 10 years, the ability to service that debt has been eroded and that really is the key to the current dilemma facing so many farmers. I know that some farmers have bought additional country next door at too high a price and that sort of thing, but, across-the-board, it is because of those reasons I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation of Western Australia suggested that farmers did not understand debt and that it was not economic conditions but seasonal fluctuations, spiralling costs, unpredictability in commodity prices and the downward spiral in farmers' terms of trade which were the problems. But, of course, everywhere it was the people who did not have the cash flow and fat on their bones who had all the troubles. The Western Australian Rural Adjustment and Finance Corporation suggested that if it were economic conditions&mdash;that is, high interest rates and high inflation&mdash;alone that caused difficulties for farmers, then all farmers would be in similar difficulties, and that, of course, is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elsewhere debt was referred to as a symptom, not a cause. It was also suggested that farmers get into difficulties because they are not profitable enough to service their debt. When you examine the causes of financial difficulties, you find that many of them are beyond the scope of individual farmers to control. So the best they can do is to be aware of them. Such things as fluctuating commodity prices and the escalation in farm costs can be accommodated and managed if the farmer's skills in financial management are enhanced. Costs and low prices are regrettable aspects of any business, but they are inevitable and must be managed if the business is to remain viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Woodley, I too have enormous sympathy with the people who are the victims of the excessive and incompetent economic policies of the Hawke and Keating governments and the consequent high interest rates of the 1980s. I would suggest that, with the news this week of another round of burgeoning foreign debt, we may well see the interest rate roulette wheel brought into play again and more people will be caught by the Labor government's mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While farmers cannot directly control the interest rates and indirect taxation that have crippled the rural sector, they can remove the government that brought them those policies. We have to get the monkey off the back of the workers of this country. Small business, whether it be farm related or non-farm, cannot continue to carry the economic imposts of indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will name a few of the imposts of indirect taxation that are affecting people in the farming sector. Wholesale taxes put a big impost on the freight onto and off a farm. All these people who have lorries that cart product onto and off farms have to pay wholesale taxes on their tyres, their motor vehicles, and the spare parts for repairs and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wholesale taxes have gone from a tax take of about $3 billion 10 years ago to a tax take of something like $13 billion now. That is a heck of a lot of extra money going into the wholesale tax coffers. Fuel taxes are a big impost for people in the farming communities. We all know how fuel excise has burgeoned in the last little while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say, `Capital gains tax is not a worry in one generation.' But the capital gains tax is basically a de facto death duty for people who want to exit the farm by giving it to a son who wants to sell it. The fringe benefits tax is another horrific cost for people in the farming sector. So the farming sector has all those costs which are things that really have to be taken off if that sector is to become very relevant in reducing their debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme report has suggested that, ultimately, education is the key to survival. I reiterate that and urge farmers to strengthen their management skills, streamline their business practices, enhance their skills and utilise the increasing range of business services available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has come to the realisation that, when people do make a dollar or two, they should have the opportunity to put money away. Although the farm management bonds do not come into practice until 1 July next year, they are a step in the right direction for when people make money so they can put it away and look after themselves in bad times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debt is a problem not only in the rural sector but in all sectors. We heard evidence that when some people get down to, say, 40 per cent equity and they have a good cash flow, they can still make a go of it and do reasonably well. However, if other people with a 70 per cent equity in a farm do not have a good cash flow, they will gradually sink down. Notwithstanding all that, I sympathise with all those people in the rural sectors that have had drought. The drought has been so widespread and hard that it has really knocked the stuffing out of many farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People may think of some way of setting aside or writing off debt, but that is not something for the committee to do. Our committee was examining the rural adjustment scheme. We could not be all things to all people and tell banks what they should do&mdash;unless we were thinking of nationalising the banks and I do not think anyone in this chamber now would think of doing that. We cannot actually tell banks to write off debt, set debt aside and set interest payments aside for a certain period of time. Although that was suggested at our inquiry, it was found that it would not be fair to everyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I had a phone call from a person who was very cranky that the people on the property next door were getting a debt write-off. Because this particular person who rang me was not in quite as necessitous circumstances, that family did not get a debt write-off from the bank. That is for the banks to decide. However, again it is not for us as a committee to decide whether it should or should not be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this report, following Senator Brownhill. Perhaps I will reflect on some of the things he said and maybe go beyond those comments. Although the terms of reference for this inquiry were reasonably wide and the evidence we received pointed to some of the fundamental problems with rural industry and communities, the report is basically limited to operating within the existing government framework. That is particularly true in relation to the part of the report which concerns RAS, which is the major part of the report and the bulk of the text. In other words, the report is concentrated on making amendments to the current rural adjustment scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we must consider the overall question of government policy in deciding what can be done about the decline in rural communities and industry and the exodus from the bush, which is so evident to us. I say this because, with the wide scope of the terms of reference for this inquiry, the hopes of many people were raised that we would address those kinds of issues. I suppose it depends on interpretation of the terms of reference. But it was very clear that many of the submissions were about these larger questions. I believe we would be remiss if we did not address those concerns in commenting on the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the recommendations contained within the report, while they would improve the rural adjustment scheme if implemented, do not get to some of these deeper problems facing Australia's farmers and rural communities. I certainly support the committee's recommendations, but to fully comprehend and to begin to rectify the enormous problems in rural Australia today, we really need to go beyond the scope of the inquiry and perhaps begin to address some of the concerns which were at least projected in the terms of reference, if not explicitly spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask ourselves how family farms&mdash;farms that have been viable for generation after generation&mdash;are suddenly so non-viable that the current generation is being forced to sell up and leave the land. I think the answer to that question would expose some far greater problems than the ones we have covered in the report of this inquiry. In many ways, I believe the drought has masked these deeper problems. The drought has certainly pushed a great number of farms to crisis point and beyond and the media has played a useful role in showing to the broader community the desperation that there is in country Australia. Of course, the response of the public has been encouraging. Perhaps I ought to say that it has been magnificent. I believe this response drove the response by the government in delivering its two drought packages to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the problems facing Australia's farmers go far deeper than just the drought. I will outline for the Senate what I see to be some of the deeper problems. The first of those problems is the one referred to by Senator Brownhill&mdash;namely, the epidemic of rural debt. This epidemic has been brought on by high interest rates, by various banking practices, by the advice and encouragement given to farmers to get big or get out and, regrettably, by insufficient scrutiny and monitoring by the farmers of the financial advice given to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of rural debt was touched on very briefly by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. I am afraid I do support some of the criticisms of the report that Senator Brownhill was defending a moment ago. The issue of rural debt needs far greater attention by the Senate. The second problem is land degradation&mdash;degradation that has occurred over a long time&mdash;and its contribution to the loss of income for farmers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third problem is the effect on farmers of the global economic system and the market fundamentalist concepts of the level playing field, user pays, free trade and so on. That is partly illustrated by what GATT has done to our tobacco industry&mdash;and what it may do to our citrus juice industry and perhaps the pork and dairy industries. The fourth problem facing farmers in rural communities is the removal of government resources from rural areas. This is particularly true of state governments. This has been further exacerbated by the competition rhetoric such as that contained in the Hilmer report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth problem relates to the entry into the industry of the large international agribusinesses, which are increasing foreign ownership of Australian resources and subsequently bringing about a reduction in the number of Australia's family farming operations. A sixth problem is the total lack of any government commitment to the maintenance of rural communities and infrastructure. More specifically, there is no policy direction from either government or coalition which is committed to the maintenance of population and industry in inland Australia. The final problem I see is the deliberate walking away from policies of cross-subsidisation on which Australia was built and on which many in our rural and remote regions rely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see these as some of the deeper problems facing rural Australia today. These are the issues that we will have to address if we are serious about rectifying the growing gulf between rural and urban Australia. The government's current rural adjustment scheme has two major foci. One is designed to make viable farms more viable&mdash;that is a worthy objective. The other seeks to remove farmers who are not viable, by definition, from rural industry altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a policy for continuing down the same disastrous track&mdash;disastrous, that is, from my point of view. While some would see that it may produce a viable rural industry, I see it continuing the dramatic exodus from the bush. We need to really ask ourselves whether we want to see the family farm survive in this country or whether we would be happy to stand by and see those farms taken over by investors and foreign owned agribusiness. The Australian Democrats are committed to fighting to protect the family farm as we believe it is an essential part of the fabric that is rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 November last year, Senator Faulkner invoked the provisions of the World Heritage Conservation Act to stop work on the Port Hinchinbrook project near Cardwell in North Queensland. His reason for this decision was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . last week my department received further information about the probable impacts on the seagrass communities of mangrove clearing on the site.</PARA>
<PARA>The project had been fully approved by the Queensland government and had been subjected to rigorous environmental study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner's own department had advised him that a deed of agreement signed by the Queensland government, the Cardwell Shire Council and the developer was a comprehensive document and represented an approach not unlike what might have been expected from a full environmental impact assessment process. The decision came after 95 per cent of the mangroves had been cleared. Senator Faulkner refused to table his new evidence. It was not until I moved a motion forcing him to table this information that he then did so at the Senate's demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called new evidence was mostly outdated letters from unknown academics and scientists from around the place calling for a stop to the project. However, I did find some recent advice which was credible from reputable managers of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the experts on reef and tropical waters. This advice was dated 14 November 1994, the day before Senator Faulkner's decision was made, and it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of regrowth mangroves presents very little threat to the seagrass beds.</PARA>
<PARA>As well, the evidence included an internal memo from Senator Faulkner's own department which stated that the recommendation from the portfolio is not to take immediate action under the World Heritage Conservation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner had known about the effect of the clearing of the mangroves four months before he made his decision. Concerns were reported in the Valentine report on the project, a report which he commissioned. He also knew that the developer had permission to clear mangroves from the tripartite agreement which he had in his hands for many months. Mr Goss delayed signing for three weeks to ensure Senator Faulkner's approval. Following his decision, under pressure from the coalition, an embarrassed Senator Faulkner then commissioned a workshop of experts to sit down and resolve whether world heritage values were infringed by the mangrove clearing. The workshop found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If significant sediment were to erode from the 4 ha mangrove removal area it could have a significant impact on adjacent seagrasses. However, there would be a high probability of recovery (within about 12 months).</PARA>
<PARA>We had a situation where Senator Faulkner had stopped a project which was fully approved by the Queensland government and which had been subject to rigorous environmental studies which were equivalent to an environmental impact assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project had been stopped without any credible evidence and in the face of all advice from the Great Barrier Marine Park Authority and the environment department. This was done after the mangroves, which were central to Senator Faulkner's world heritage concerns, had been cleared. It was also done at a time which ensured that work could not begin until after the wet season, leaving a scarred site to drain into the surrounding channel area, causing environmental degradation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, 40 jobs and over $1 million in revenue were lost. Senator Faulkner was embarrassed by his own workshop experts who argued that the project should go ahead. One would think that Senator Faulkner would have then approved the project&mdash;but he did not and he still has not. All work on the project has stalled. Senator Faulkner will not give an ironclad approval for the project through to completion. He has created a labyrinth of environmental bureaucracy impossible for the developer to travel through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to the Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage, Mrs Molly Robson, on 23 December 1994, Senator Faulkner attached a list of 11 processes involved in various stages of the development which may&mdash;and I emphasise may&mdash;threaten world heritage values in his opinion. These 11 processes include beach and foreshore management, remaining fringe mangroves, site stabilisation, breakwater construction, channel dredging, de-watering of the marina and dredge spoil pool, acid sulphate soils, monitoring and site management, baseline studies and long-term planning for Hinchinbrook Channel. Advice was given on how these processes should be addressed, and this was plagued with management plans and scientific studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has advised the developer that, to commence activity which could damage world heritage values, he must make a request to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories so that the minister can assess whether the activity is likely to damage world heritage values, and that these assessments could take some time. The minister stated in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcomes contained in this document set out a range of issues and processes that are considered relevant to ensuring that World Heritage values are protected. As far as I am concerned the construction can now proceed on this basis, that is subject to these processes being put in place and those outcomes relevant to Port Hinchinbrook development being satisfactory in terms of meeting my concerns about World Heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Faulkner also warned that `should the above processes produce evidence of a threat to world heritage values then clearly action would be needed to protect them'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst giving this half-hearted approval to the project, the minister has made it impossible for the developer to start the project with any certainty that he will be able to finish it. The project could be stopped by the minister at any time. Any time the developer requests an activity it will take days, weeks or even months to be processed, and it then faces possible rejection by the minister. As such, the developer has stated that he will not start on the project until Senator Faulkner gives clear approval for it through to completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you would understand: this is what is wrong with this government; it is a government made up of ex-union bosses, ex-Labor Party officials&mdash;of which Senator Faulkner, I think, is both&mdash;and perhaps a couple of teachers. They have no idea how business works. They have absolutely no appreciation of what you need to do if you are investing millions of dollars in a project that will create a lot of jobs and bring a lot of export income into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving this sort of approval subject to these sorts of conditions is just ridiculous. It is no wonder that the developer has said, `This is not an approval.' This sort of conditional approval, subject to all these things, is really subject to the minister at any time coming along and saying, `I want it stopped' or every time the developer proceeds on a stage he has to refer it to the minister and refer it to his department and they could take days, weeks or months to look at it. You just cannot run an investment or a development like that. It is obvious that the developer just simply will not go ahead on those bases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> exposed seven other projects in North Queensland which had had approval or part-approval from the Queensland government but which were in areas bordering on world heritage areas. There is some concern that many of these also will be stopped by Senator Faulkner. In Townsville, North Queensland, less than an hour south of the Port Hinchinbrook development, we have the same fiasco going again on the Magnetic Keys project on Magnetic Island. That project has been approved by the Queensland government and subjected to environmental assessments. It has been given approval, subject to sensitive environmental conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But again Senator Faulkner has come in over the top and stopped that project which would do so much for Townsville and so much for the economy of North Queensland; it would create jobs and much needed export income. But, yet again, here is this minister&mdash;the minister for stopping things in Australia; the Forrest Gump, we now call him; the minister who has cost all the jobs of all these people with all these trucks around Parliament House, the small businessmen in real problems&mdash;doing it again in Port Hinchinbrook in Far North Queensland and at Magnetic Keys in Townsville. It is just the same sort of thing. This minister, who does not understand business, is doing his best to cost Australia jobs and chase away investment</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All this week my colleagues and I in the coalition have been fighting for the workers, families and communities who have been so shamefully treated by this Labor government's inept and damaging handling of the forest issue. We have had this interfactional dispute between a right wing minister and a left wing minister. Then the left wing of the party organised majority caucus support for Senator Faulkner. Now the same left wing is split and members of caucus are threatening to resign. Senator Devereux has already resigned for the obvious reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is: Labor is in a shambles. It is destroying people's livelihoods, and it has lost direction as a government. Labor is going everywhere at once yet at the same time is going nowhere. We therefore need to ask the question: how did Labor get itself into such a mess? There are the answers: the government is incompetent; it is arrogant; and it engages in sleazy opportunistic deals. They might all be reasons. But this evening I suggest that the major reason is the involvement of one Simon Balderstone, the only survivor from what was the staff of former Prime Minister Hawke who is still with the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Mr Balderstone is the senior environmental adviser to the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In volume 2, No. 12, of the glossy environmentalist magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Simply Living</EMPHASIS>, Simon Balderstone wrote an article entitled `Eco Defence' to bring Australia's attention to the radical organisation known as Earth First. Earth First members pride themselves on being `conservation commandos'. In the editorial part of the article, Balderstone says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Direct action, whether it be lying in front of a bulldozer, or sabotaging environmentally-destructive items such as billboards or logging-plants, has its supporters and opponents, but hardly anyone in the Australian conservation movement denies it has played an important role in the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, while the `Earth First!' movement, led by Dave Foreman (see our interview p.24) in America is acknowledged as the front line for what it calls `ecotage' by `ecoteurs', even that movement cites blockades on the Franklin River . . .</PARA>
<PARA>and elsewhere in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as admirable examples of necessary direct action by the conservation movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Tasmania, Earth First held up a train. You may well recall that incident, Mr Acting Deputy President. The person used the false name of David Rainbow. Earth First spiked trees with metal rods. As a result, a lot of the timber industry now uses metal detectors to determine whether trees are spiked. To overcome that problem, Earth First is now using or threatening to use ceramic rods which will not be detected by these metal detecting devices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is nothing short of terrorism because the workers outside this place would have to consider every single day whether they are going to come home alive. The wives and the children at home would have to ask themselves whether their husbands or fathers will be trying to saw a log that has a metal or ceramic spike in it. This is nothing short of terrorism that Earth First promotes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And the second most powerful man in this government, Simon Balderstone, immediately under the Prime Minister, writes in glowing terms about such an organisation. It is therefore time for Mr Balderstone to come out and say to the Australian people who it is that he serves. Does he serve the Australian government and the Australian people or the extreme green cause. He is paid by Australians&mdash;I would imagine, in excess of $75,000 per annum&mdash;and for that sum he ought to be working in the best interests of the people of Australia and not just for the extreme green movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My suggestion this evening is that he is working for the extreme green movement, and that is what his agenda is. No longer is he concerned about sabotage in the bush when he can do sabotage in the Prime Minister's office and wreak havoc on the industry by getting the Prime Minister and ministers to sign documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence was there today because today in the parliament, in the other place, the Prime Minister said that no state of Australia has invited the Commonwealth to partake in a regional forest agreement. That is untrue. Therefore, the Prime Minister has either misled the House or perchance&mdash;I would suggest this is the more likely&mdash;he was misadvised by Simon Balderstone. Because the truth is that Tasmania did invite the Commonwealth to engage in a regional forest agreement before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy statement refers to states having the possibility of inviting the Commonwealth. This was to be organised through a document which was being drafted to determine the rules and regulations and the way in which these regional forest agreements would be undertaken. The Commonwealth had that task. In February 1994 it had a draft. In August 1994 it promised the final version in September of 1994. That document has never been provided. One asks why, if it was only a week away in August of 1994, it has taken so long to be provided. In fact, it still has not been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it as a result of environmental sabotage in the Prime Minister's office? Is it a deliberate ploy to ensure that regional forest agreements will not take place? And might I add, despite the Commonwealth's tardiness or deliberate sabotage by Mr Balderstone, the Tasmanian government said, `We will enter into one of these arrangements on certain terms.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to ask a lot of questions of Mr Balderstone and the way that this whole issue has been treated. So I ask: prior to yesterday's meeting with the Premier of Tasmania, had the Prime Minister been informed by his adviser Simon Balderstone of all the details of the offer that had been received from Tasmania to become a signatory to the national forest policy statement and to undertake detailed studies leading to a regional forest agreement for Tasmania? Was the Prime Minister advised that Tasmania was not seeking any special deals and was prepared to sign?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he was advised of that by Simon Balderstone, as he should have been, the Prime Minister misled the other place today. Or the Prime Minister was misled by Simon Balderstone, and the Prime Minister and Simon Balderstone can sort that out between themselves. Clearly, one of them has been engaged in a game of misleading the public of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also ask: did Simon Balderstone make a commitment to representatives of the Wilderness Society in September of last year that 500 coupes would be set aside from logging? Did Mr Balderstone release to Bob Burton and Alec Marr a detailed list of 509 coupes to be withdrawn from forestry operations prior to those lists being made available to the relevant action ministers, namely, Beddall and Faulkner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his media release of 27 January 1995, the Minister for Resources, Mr Beddall, was not aware. Yet it is now quite transparent that the Greens knew the list. So the following question has to be asked: if that list was determined in the Prime Minister's office, how did the Greens get it before the Minister for Resources and the states? I suggest that there is a clear link. Somebody in the Prime Minister's office leaked it, and one can ask who that might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that it is quite apparent that a deal was struck with the Greens by Mr Balderstone, and he is now being held to it by the extreme Greens. That is why the government is in such a mess; it realises that, if Mr Balderstone seeks to renege, they will do what Paul Keating did to Bob Hawke on the Kirribilli House agreement.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The recommendation referred to was made in the report of the Australian Delegation to the OECD Chemicals Group and Management Committee Working Group on the Development of a Council Act on Risk Reduction of Lead held in November 1993. The Environment Protection Agency is the lead agency of the Australian delegation. The exact wording was ` . . . including through thorough preparation for the Canadian Workshop in collaboration with environment interests, industry and technical experts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation was not a formal undertaking by or to government, but one of a number of suggested courses of action leading up to the Canadian Workshop. It was made before the scope and nature of the Workshop were fully known. When the OECD Secretariat circulated the Terms of Reference for the Workshop in February 1994 it was clear that it was to be a fact-finding rather than an overall policy-making forum. The Workshop was convened:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to examine transboundary problems associated with some ten categories of products/uses of lead, including lead shot and fishing sinkers, faucets, crystal and ceramic ware, plastics, paint, and gasoline;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to consider practical options to control lead exposure, including the use of lead substitutes; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to evaluate the potential implications of such solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In gathering the required technical information, the EPA and other Commonwealth agencies responsible for briefing the Australian delegation to the Workshop consulted extensively with industry, particularly with lead end-users. NGOs were not consulted at this stage because the overall Australian position on a possible Council Act on lead had not altered since the February 1994 meeting of the OECD Chemicals Group and Management Committee. The EPA did consult with NGOs in reaching consensus on an Australian position before the February meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The EPA fully supports OECD activities which engender international co-operation in reducing health and environmental risks due to exposure to lead, particularly co-operative activities leading to information exchange and technology transfer. One such undertaking has been the publication of the `OECD Risk Reduction Monograph No. 1: Lead'. The EPA co-ordinated the substantial contribution made by Australian governments, industry and environment interests. With respect to an OECD Council Act on lead, Australia does not support prescriptive international pollution control or abatement measures unless there is clear evidence that the pollution being addressed has significant transboundary effects. Australia's view is that lead risk reduction is primarily a national issue due to the differing nature of problems faced by Member countries and differing social, economic and environmental conditions and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only transboundary issues of concern to emerge from the Canadian Workshop were bird shot and fishing sinkers, lead in petrol, and trade in consumer products that pose a direct risk of exposure (ceramic foodware). The latter problem arises largely from articles traded by non OECD countries. The issue of lead shot and fishing sinkers is a regional one, largely between Canada and the USA. Transboundary pollution from lead in petrol is primarily a problem within Europe and, in Australia's view, best dealt with through such forums as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As outlined above, between February and September 1994 the EPA has been engaged in assembling the technical information required as background to the Canadian Workshop. The findings of the Workshop were considered at the November 1994 meeting of the OECD Chemicals Group and Management Committee. As a result, the EPA and relevant Commonwealth agencies will need to consider a range of policy options with respect to an OECD Council Act in the New Year, and will consult with NGOs and industry in recommending to Government Australia's preferred policy approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Consultations between industry, NGOs and the government with respect to lead-related OECD activities fall into three distinct periods. The first, from late 1991 to mid 1992, covered preparation of Australia's input to the OECD Monograph on Lead. The EPA consulted extensively with industry, environment NGOs, and Commonwealth and state government agencies. The Australian Conservation Foundation and the LEAD and NO LEAD groups participated fully in this process. In the second period, from late 1992 to November 1993, the EPA again consulted with governments, industry and NGOs in reaching an Australian position on a possible OECD Council Act on lead. The third and most recent phase is explained above. Immediately following the Canadian Workshop the EPA did attempt to arrange a debriefing meeting with representatives of environment NGOs. This meeting was subsequently cancelled due to invitees' non-availability and/or lack of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider that tabling a full list of the numerous meetings and other communications which have taken place between industry, NGOs and the Government over a three and a half year period is an unwarranted drain on agency resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Since November 1991 approximately thirty Australian representatives have attended OECD meetings at which lead risk reduction activities have been discussed. Only two of these meetings were dedicated to lead risk reduction, and both involved consideration of an OECD Council Act on lead. Delegates included officers from the EPA, the National Registration Authority, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of Human Services and Health, and Worksafe. The cost to the Australian government would be in the order of $240,000, of which only a portion was directly related to lead risk reduction. At no stage has the Australian government funded the attendance of representatives of either industry or non-government environment groups at these meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) I have made available to Senator Coulter a copy of Australia's input to the Canadian Workshop, a paper entitled `The Rationale for OECD Risk Reduction on Lead: Some Issues for Consideration'. Further copies are available from the Senate Table Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) As explained above, the EPA attempted to arrange a debriefing on the Canadian Workshop in October as part of the lead-up to the November 1993 Joint Meeting of OECD's Chemicals Group and Management Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of whether or not to have an OECD Lead Council Act was not resolved at the November meeting. Instead, it was decided to form two Working Groups; one to develop a draft Council Act and the other to develop an alternative strategy. Outcomes of each are to be considered by the OECD at its Joint Meeting in June/July 1995. Appropriate consultation with NGOs will occur prior to the meeting.</PARA>

This represented 57% of all driver deaths which occurred during this period. The remaining drivers were excluded from the study largely due to insufficient information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 December 1994 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 4081) Senator Watson asked me a question without notice concerning the inflation implications for Australia of growth in the money supply, comparing the growth of money supply in Australia with that of comparable countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monetary policy is primarily set with the medium term objective of maintaining low inflation and low inflation expectations. Maintaining low inflation is vital if Australia is to achieve the investment needed to ensure sustained economic and employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1990, both headline and underlying inflation have slowed significantly. Headline inflation has been below 2 per cent in each of the last three financial years. This is the longest period of sustained low inflation since the early 1960s. Underlying inflation has been around 2 per cent in each of the last two financial years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's inflation rate has been at a level comparable to that of our major trading partners for around 3 1/2 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not allow these gains on inflation to be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy the authorities carefully monitor a range of economic and financial indicators in gauging inflationary pressures. These include trends in capacity utilisation and labour market conditions,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">wage agreements, price increases and price setting behaviour by firms, changes in inflation expectations, monetary and credit aggregates, movements in the $A and the current and prospective state of the world economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purposes of considering adjustments to monetary policy, the emphasis is on how the indicators may be foreshadowing future developments in relation to inflation and activity. No one indicator is paramount in this process and no prescriptive relative weightings are placed on the various indicators. Since deregulation of the financial sector in the early 1980s growth in the monetary aggregates has proved to be less reliable as an indicator of economic developments due to continued institutional change and financial innovation. Other countries have had a similar experience. International comparisons of money supply growth are also not necessarily meaningful because of different measures and institutional structures operating in different countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is to be expected, growth in the monetary aggregates has increased since the recession. However, as illustrated in the chart below, growth in the money base, M3 and broad money are still moderate. M1 has been growing strongly for some time, but this appears to be due, to a considerable extent, to a long-term trend towards cheque-linked accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[CHART OMITTED FROM DATABASE - SEE HARD COPY PAGE 479]</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank and the Government are committed to maintaining underlying inflation at around 2 to 3 per cent over the course of the economic cycle. In the light of evidence that the economy is growing very strongly, the Reserve Bank has raised official interest rates in three discrete moves since August 1994. While current underlying inflation remains low, because of the lags involved, official interest rates have been adjusted in a timely manner to moderate economic activity and hence potential future inflationary pressures.</PARA>
