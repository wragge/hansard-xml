And Senator Collins can roll his eyes later if he wants to. We then had a discussion about the various implications of government amendments Nos 4, 11 and 14. We in fact agreed that we should not only defer them until a later hour that day but also subsequently defer them until the following day&mdash;being now&mdash;in order that each of us could have a briefing on the subject.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of the questions and answers in the committee stage yesterday, I indicated to the government in what it might call the briefing&mdash;the scrambled meeting at the back of the chamber&mdash;that I would be attempting to clarify the government's amendment by way of my own amendment.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then I ask that it be circulated as quickly as possible. While that is happening, I will explain what it is about. There have been changes to it in response to certain concerns. Its rationale, as a result of the questions and answers yesterday, was to clarify the situation with regard to the government's amendment No. 14, the amendment that relates to the grandfathering provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question was asked about what the situation would be if the holder of interests in excess of 15 per cent changed their holding in any way, either above or below 15 per cent. Unfortunately, the answers given by the duty minister yesterday seemed to be at odds with what the Australian Democrats, the opposition and the Greens believed to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believed that, while there was controversy about the original provision allowing a holding of more than 15 per cent, the understanding was that the holding would revert to 15 per cent if the interests of the holder were deliberately increased or decreased around that figure yet were still above 15 per cent. Unfortunately, the wording of the government's amendment does not make that clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, whilst the amendment allows a managed trade down from the grandfathered figure to 15 per cent, there is an anomaly by which people would be allowed to deliberately trade up by other means, go back to 17 per cent and yet not be considered to have breached the provisions. Therefore, the grandfathering provision could not be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not think that entrenching privilege is the right way to go, nor that allowing a managed trade down is fair&mdash;despite the controversy about the original holdings of a particular person&mdash;nor that allowing it to be done in stages is fair. Allowing a grandfathering provision might well be considered to be fair. But for a person to deliberately trade up and then be required only to get down to a grandfathered position, and to be able to maintain a position of privilege even if they have deliberately traded up, seems to be ridiculous. We feel that needs to be clarified. That is what my amendment seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, we talked about the relevant person changing his or her company interests in the company referred to. In discussion with Senator Bourne from the Democrats, we have altered our position in response to their concerns to allow a managed trade down. In reality, our position is not much different from that of the government's. Obviously, there are penalties if a person exceeds 15 per cent. By logical extension, those penalties apply to the person who is grandfathered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government's amendment does not clearly say that. There is an assumption that penalties are involved but it would be unwise not to clarify the situation. If the reality is that there is a penalty for trading above that grandfathered position, it would be a lot better to clarify the situation so that it is clear that deliberate trading up in any way will result in losing that privileged position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a copy of Senator Margetts's amendment, and I have one question on a matter which I am not quite sure about. Until the minister's advisers have a copy, I probably cannot ask their opinion of it. Let me make a similar point to the one that Senator Margetts has made. I believe we were all concerned yesterday about the possibility of somebody deliberately increasing their company interests above where they were grandfathered to&mdash;above their privileged position. The minister's response yesterday, if I recall correctly, was to ask why you would do it because you would be in breach. You would only have to go back down and would possibly be fined a great deal of money for every day that you were over that limit. That is a good point. But if you were of the opinion that it would be very stupid for somebody to do it at all they have to have what they consider to be a good reason to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason I can think of would be if you were trying it on; if you wanted to see if you could get away with more. If that is the case, if no-one else can think of a really good reason&mdash;and I cannot imagine that anyone could&mdash;immediately you are in breach. You have deliberately put yourself in breach of the law by buying up. I cannot see why you would not have to immediately go back to where everyone else in Australia is: that is, with 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I support Senator Margetts's amendment but I have one question. The last line of the amendment reads `that grandfathering provided for by this section is taken not to apply to the person'. I am not sure that that line achieves what we are trying to achieve. People sitting with the minister, who I assume are expert in this sort of drafting&mdash;which I am not and which, I suspect, Senator Margetts is not, because it is very difficult&mdash;may be able to tell me if this amendment achieves that. What we want to achieve is that, if a person deliberately puts himself in breach by going over the limit, he should have to go back to 15 per cent. A person can manage his holdings downwards towards the 15 per cent but cannot go back up again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not actually clear to me precisely what the intent of the Greens' amendment is. I have not been able to get any clearer understanding of that from the officers because it is not clear to them either. I will return to that issue, but I would like to clear up the confusion over the point raised by Senator Alston. My advice is that Senator Alston's concern is a valid one. Briefings were, on advice, provided to the Greens and the Democrats. I assumed because Senator Alston is considered to be omniscient that he did not need a briefing. He was in fact entitled to one, and I apologise for that misunderstanding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could I ask for some procedural guidance? I regret that I was away yesterday and was not able to follow what happened in here. Would it be possible for the committee to consider voting on amendments Nos 4 and 11?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The CHAIRMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had that discussion yesterday when we were discussing the three amendments together. I think the idea that everybody agreed with was that we would vote on amendments 4 and 11 and vote on amendment 14 separately.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I address three or four issues at once? I am indebted to Senator Bob Collins for the information that he has provided to the Senate. I do not think there is any dispute from the other side of the chamber that there was an undertaking given to provide briefings to all relevant parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am flattered at the suggestion that the omission might be due to some presumption of knowledge on our part, the more sinister explanation is that someone in the minister's office&mdash;perhaps not the advisers&mdash;took the view that, if the Democrats and the Greens were happy and onside, as prematurely reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today, therefore, the numbers meant that there was no need to brief the opposition. That seems to me to be a more credible explanation, but at the same time a much more disappointing one because it suggests a cavalier attitude on the part of those who must have been aware of the undertaking given to provide a briefing, but who essentially ripped it up when they did not think it was necessary any longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, can I address the other issues that are currently before the Senate. It seems to me that what Senator Margetts has in mind is essentially that, where you deliberately&mdash;`voluntary' really is the term&mdash;breach the current arrangements or go above your floor level, then you ought to pay the penalty of being reduced to the statutory maximum of 15 per cent. Where it is accidental, Senator Margetts would, presumably, accept that the grandfathering arrangements proposed in amendment 14 would allow you to simply come back down to where you were, which is 17.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spirit of that is certainly understandable and coherent. The difficulty in not having had the briefing is that we are not able to canvass whether Senator Margetts's amendment does stack up in achieving that or whether it adds very much to the sum total of what is sought to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I can say from the opposition's position that, because we take the view that all of this is piecemeal, there does not seem to be great merit in us, in effect, tightening or even clarifying the grandfathering provision when we essentially say that the grandfathering position and the new 15 per cent limit ought to be opposed. So, for that reason, I foreshadow that I would be opposed to your amendment, just as I would be opposed to amendment 14. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in the event that amendments 4 and 11 are passed, then I may well take the view that we let amendment 14 through because I do not want a combination to result in any grandfathering being removed. If it is your position that even if your amendment fails you would still want to oppose amendment 14, then I think we would have to support it for all the wrong reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I ought to add some explanation as well. It is very unfortunate that everybody seems to be informed by the media rather than by the people involved here. In the particular case of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that was reported today, it is unfortunate that the journalist involved rang and left a message and then rang back and spoke to someone in my office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, we clearly indicated in the meeting yesterday with the government advisers that there were elements that we were not happy with. I did make a mention in that meeting that I was preparing an amendment. I do not think anyone in the meeting would be unclear about the fact that I had an intention of preparing an amendment. Therefore, if there was any impression made to the media that everything was hunky-dory, it would have been a wrong impression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The journalist himself last night contacted me and said, `I've written up this story and said that you are happy with it.' I said, `That's terrific. It would have been nice to check with me first.' The deadline had already passed. He changed the second edition, but he said, `I have to warn you that the edition that is coming to Canberra has you saying that you agree with it,' which is an interesting way of writing a story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I just thought I would clarify that. I have not been changing my mind every five minutes. It is simply that the journalist in question made an assumption that he was not entitled to make, wrote it in a story and it was too late to amend it by the time he had actually checked whether or not we were in that situation. We did not mean to keep anyone checking. That may well have caused or not caused any urgency to communicate with the opposition. But I would like to apologise and say that it was not of my doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just very briefly, and this will be the last thing I will say on the subject: I am assured that those were the circumstances. I understand Senator Alston's concern. But, as he knows, there is an old axiom in this business which is more often right than wrong, and that is: if it is a choice between a conspiracy and a stuff-up, nine times out of 10 it is a stuff-up. I am assured, Senator Alston, that on this occasion it is one of the nine out of 10; it is not a conspiracy, as Senator Margetts has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In indicating that the government will not be supporting the amendment of the Greens&mdash;and to do this shortly&mdash;I might just briefly say that we simply feel that the proposals which have been put forward by the government deal with this matter effectively but also more equitably than by the Democrats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just a brief point. The reason for our amendment is that we feel that that is, in fact, entrenching privilege. Because of the general principle of not changing something after a decision has been made, despite the controversy about whether or not that decision should ever have been made in the first place, we know that it was not an illegal act because the ABA, after long debate and public discussion, said, `Ah yes, technically it wasn't a problem because somebody else had a higher holding,' et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the original decision was controversial. But to suggest that somebody could then change their interest to increase that and then be still protected by a grandfathering clause if they broke the conditions does seem to be entrenching privilege. That is the reason for this: to clarify the situation to ensure that we are not entrenching privilege, so that we can ensure equity eventually reigns and that any move is moved down so that everybody is treated fairly. I think that is the right thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is preparing now to deal with 4 and 11 first, we would be happy to deal with it in that way. We will go the way the umpire decides. But it is important that people see the rationale by which major decisions on broadcasting are being made and whether or not equity is really the motive behind it. That is of great concern to us. </PARA>

As Senator Alston has said by way of interjection, to quote Gilbert and Sullivan, the punishment fits the crime.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of further clarification, does that mean that if a court finds that a person is in breach the fine will be effective from the moment that person was in breach or from the moment that the court found the person to be in breach? This is quite important. It could involve a complex court case and it could go for a considerable length of time. Is it possible that the person in breach is allowed to keep those holdings and then is fined from the time the court finds a breach or, if it is a long court case, can the person be retrospectively fined from the time they were considered by the court to be in breach? This is quite complex. It is important to see whether what you have decided on is a fair grandfathering clause.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is why I would imagine that the companies involved in this case would be scrupulously careful that they did not deliberately flout the law.

It is not making a person do something right now; it is just giving a signal that, if you do trade up, then you are no longer protected by the grandfathering. Basically, it is giving a general principle that everybody should be treated alike, but that there is a recognition that forcing a person to trade down because it is felt necessary to clarify a situation is retrospective. It simply gives a notice; it does not force anyone to do anything. Therefore, it is not retrospective, but it does give a punitive effect by saying, if you now trade up, there is an outcome. The outcome is that you are treated like everybody else. That is not retrospective; it is punitive. It is not retrospective because it does not force anyone now to do anything.

I point out the obvious: we believe that the way in which the government's amendment is currently constructed is the fairest and most equitable way of dealing with it&mdash;that is, providing a penalty for where that increase in equity is deliberate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to construct a situation which I suppose could occur that is caught up by your amendment. If the ABA initiated legal action and they felt there was a case, obviously, they would take legal advice, and always do, before proceeding with such action. If a court subsequently found that a person had not deliberately done that, the court would behave appropriately. From a government perspective&mdash;that is why I said I think ours is more equitable&mdash;I think that is the correct position. If a person has done this inadvertently&mdash;I am trying to construct in my own head a situation where this could occur and it is very difficult&mdash;and a court, with all of the checks and balances that our courts have, finds that that person has not been directly responsible for this and there has been a temporary fluctuation&mdash;</PARA>

The intent of this amendment is that that person would then have to take their company interests down to 15 per cent.

It is designed to come back to the situation that we all thought we were in yesterday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take up from where I was yesterday on the Airports Bill 1995. I remind the Senate that for people in regional areas in particular this is a very vital bill. We should be very careful not to act in a way that we will regret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Airports Bill, as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, is to establish the regulatory arrangement to apply to the airports currently owned and operated by the FAC and to the Sydney West airport following the leasing of those airports. As we all know, it is meant, first of all, to govern the sale of Sydney and Sydney West airports and the Melbourne and Brisbane airports, but the other FAC owned airports, including the Hobart and Launceston airports, will come into line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that an airport lease will have a term of no longer than 50 years with an option to renew for up to 49 years&mdash;we are talking long-term arrangements&mdash;and that each airport will be operated by a separate company which must not undertake substantial trading or financial activities other than activities related to the development and/or operation of the airport or activities incidental to that purpose. Restrictions will apply to the transfer of airport leases, primarily to ensure the integrity of the public interest regulatory controls set out in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do acknowledge that the government has put its mind to the question of regulatory controls, but the clear principle is whether that will be good for the travelling public&mdash;will it benefit or damage the economy in the areas concerned? Being a senator from the state of Tasmania, I am concerned with the fact that eventually&mdash;by 1997, I think&mdash;the FAC owned airports in Hobart and Launceston will be sold and privatised. My concern of course is that an economy such as Tasmania's, which is largely dependent on sea and air links, could be enormously damaged if travellers or freight were burdened with a quasi tax&mdash;caused by privatisation&mdash;in the form of higher airport charges on flights to and from Tasmania. That is the essence of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a monopoly, and I raised this matter with the minister at an estimates committee early last year. But the minister responded by saying, `No, we are attempting to create competition.' Of course, competition is an essential plank of the micro-economic reform. Does the government mean that there will be competition between Hobart and Launceston airports? That is ludicrous&mdash;competition indeed! Are they suggesting that people are going to drive from Launceston to Hobart, or vice versa&mdash;which is a 2 1/2-hour journey&mdash;and catch a flight because it may be marginally cheaper as some sort of arrangement had been achieved? It is nonsense to suggest that the competitive element is there&mdash;that plank of micro-economic reform just is not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is an inherent conflict between the following two principles: the government's desire to maximise the sale proceeds from the disposal of airports, and the government's objective of economic efficiency&mdash;that is, of providing infrastructure to all comers at marginal cost. Infrastructure such as airports should be governed so as to provide a service to all comers at marginal cost. If that principle is not followed, then this legislation, while it may not be doomed to failure, will mean that the people concerned will carry heavier economic burdens. That is what really worries me. It is something that I have been raising with the minister, as I said, since early last year, and I will continue to raise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the first principle&mdash;the desire on the part of the government to maximise the sale proceeds from the disposal of airports. That is a legitimate desire, because the airports have been paid for by the taxpayers and the travelling public. They have been paid for, so you have to get a reasonable result from the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being asked by the government to pass this piece of legislation which will give the go-ahead, the green light, for the sale of huge, very expensive and crucial tracts of land within Australia to private enterprise. We are being asked to do that without knowing and without being told the results of the scoping studies. I have been asking the government for quite a long time, `Can't we get the scoping studies so that we will be able to see and be able to assess within our offices whether or not the price that is likely to be paid by the bidders for the airports is appropriate and whether it reflects appropriately the input by taxpayers, the travelling public and industry up until this point in time?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not having really been given satisfaction on this particular matter, I wrote to the state government and referred the state government to my questions and letter to Minister Brereton. In that letter of April 1995 I did ask him in the last sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I, therefore, request that full details of the scoping study for the sale of the airports be made publicly available as soon as possible and be presented to parliament at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>I sent a copy of that letter to a number of people, including the Premier of Tasmania, from whom I received a letter which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share your concern for Tasmania and advise that the position, in relation to the State's particular vulnerability, has been clearly articulated in our responses to the Scoping and Regulatory Study Task force.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on and indicates that his government has met on a number of occasions with, and written to, the minister requesting the results of the scoping and regulatory studies. He indicates in the fourth paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the leasehold sale process ensures the Federal Government remains as "ultimate guarantor", its obligations and the wider strategic and regional development policy considerations which impact on the capital investment and operational decisions of the airports, will be removed.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In transferring its airports in Tasmania, the Federal Government must have particular regard to the importance of these facilities to Tasmania in terms of ensuring basic and equitable levels of access. As you know Tasmania's FAC airports are crucial components in the region's transport and economic infrastructure and provide critical passenger and freight links. As such, considerations of regional economic development, social equity, security of access and strategic importance are critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is these considerations that may be removed or seriously jeopardised by the transfer of direct control from the Federal Government. Accordingly, arrangements at the point of airport transfer need to be put in place to ensure that these ongoing responsibilities of the Federal Government are not compromised.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not go on with the rest of the letter, but I would like to indicate to the government my concern that these matters have not been adequately dealt with by it in response to my interventions over a period of time. I would like to know what response the minister has given to the Tasmanian government in relation to the letter of the Tasmanian Premier in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do say this: as I understand it and as the government has stated and restated the matter, micro-economic reform is all about improving efficiency and reducing costs. Quite frankly, I have some doubts about this. I know that there are a fair few people around this place who, if they could have their tongues loosened, would demonstrate that they also have some doubts about it. My doubts about it are directed not only at the activities of the federal government but also at the activities of state governments. State governments tend these days to boast about balanced budgets and that they no longer have the budget deficits they did have. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do understand Senator Harradine's concerns about the continued satisfactory operation of these two airports in Tasmania. I would confirm for Senator Harradine information which is already in the public domain: many of the government's own members have an equal interest&mdash;and I include myself in that category&mdash;in the airports in their own regions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Northern Territory, the key that unlocked the construction of our two superb terminal buildings in Alice Springs and Darwin&mdash;in the case of the Darwin terminal, after about half a century of lobbying to get a new airport terminal&mdash;was getting those airports put on the list of airports controlled by the Federal Airports Corporation when it was first established. If that had not happened, I think we probably would still be waiting for new airport terminals in Darwin and Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, they resulted from a significant concession being made by the then finance minister, Peter Walsh&mdash;not someone who was entirely beloved in the Northern Territory. Nevertheless I have to say, and give public commendation at this point in saying it, that Senator Walsh's agreement to write off a significant portion of the debt from those airports was absolutely instrumental in getting the FAC to agree to construct both of those terminal buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of concern and positive concern from government members as well. If it had not been for those concerns being allayed&mdash;and that is the point I wish to make&mdash;this legislation would never have proceeded. There was, in fact, a very active involvement by the members of the government's caucus in this issue. We have had firm assurances given on behalf of the government to all of those people&mdash;and I give those same assurances again to Senator Harradine&mdash;that the interests of the users of these airports will be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will ensure that Tasmania's strategic interests are protected throughout the entire leasing process. Of course, as Senator Harradine knows, the proposal is that the Hobart and Launceston terminals will be dealt with in the second stage of airport disposals, which is scheduled for 1997-98. Federal and Tasmanian officials are participating already in a steering committee. Consultants have provided financial and technical advice on the infrastructure at Launceston and Hobart&mdash;on the needs of those airports&mdash;and the alternative ownership and management options that will be available for those airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt, knowing the intense interest in airport operations in any community and the vital part that airports play in the life of any community now, that will be a very transparent process at Hobart and Launceston during the time that elapses between now and 1997-98. It may well be&mdash;I cannot know this in advance&mdash;that there will be active interest in the community itself owning the airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason I make that point is that during the period of time when I was transport minister the Commonwealth handed over to local control literally hundreds of airports which had formerly, for reasons that escape me, been administered by the Commonwealth from Canberra&mdash;a fairly unwieldy situation I must say. It has been in many cases a source of great success and, I might say, pride for the local communities where the councils themselves have actually taken on the responsibility of airport ownership and the running of those airports. Indeed, at various times local government in the Northern Territory has expressed a strong interest. You could not at this point in time rule out that that may well be one of the options for these airports or indeed for other local governments. But that is all something for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The steering committee is under way and the consultant reports are being provided. No doubt there will be more. The Commonwealth will continue to consult closely with local interest groups to ensure that all of the alternative options are canvassed fully and the implications of those options are fully understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is well aware of the importance of these airports to Tasmania's infrastructure. Acknowledging Senator Harradine's concern, Tasmania is in a different position from mainland Australia in respect of both air and sea transport in that it does not have the alternatives readily available to mainland Australia in many places of road and rail. Therefore, this is an even more important concern for Tasmanians than perhaps it would be for other places where those alternatives are more readily available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the specific characteristics of each airport, as well as regional and local community interests, will be taken into account when evaluating the leasing strategy and bids for these airports. As well as that positive and proactive involvement in the Commonwealth in this exercise, personally I, knowing the number of community groups with a direct active involvement in the impacts of an airport on any community, have no doubt that airport operators will have a considerable gauntlet to run, a very practical gauntlet to run, at each and every level of the community if they did for some reason intend to be unscrupulous or monopolistic in their behaviour to airport charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, that would go upwards and would include the body that keeps surveillance on prices. From a practical perspective, from my knowledge of airport operations and from the interest shown in them from tourist associations, local councils and everyone else, there would be a significant gauntlet for any airport operator, as a responsible member of that community, to run in respect of airport charges. I conclude my remarks on that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Minister, even as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was making its ruling on the ACTU/Weipa dispute this morning, the Australian Workers Union and other unions were extending the strike to the Boyne Island alumina smelter at Gladstone. A union spokesman actually boasted, `No-one is crossing the picket line and the smelter is effectively closed.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the opposition wanting a diversionary tactic because, on the evidence so far, their argument is not going very far in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This morning, while the commission has not yet delivered a final ruling, it did issue a statement saying that, in deliberately seeking to eliminate the role of unions, CRA's actions were inconsistent with the Industrial Relations Act. That is a basic endorsement of the government's and the union's position on the centrality of collective bargaining in the Australian industrial relations system and it is a ringing endorsement of the legitimacy of the role of unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, of course, need to look at each of these industrial disputes in their own terms. I am not sure of the circumstances of the particular matter that Senator Macdonald refers to and I am not going to comment on it until I do know the circumstances of it. But if it is an example of trade unions furthering their rights to collective bargaining and asserting a position as to the centrality of collective bargaining and a determination to resist that role of the unions being pushed aside or crushed by the response of particular companies, then there is a right for the trade union movement to protect itself. I don't comment on the circumstances of that particular dispute and wouldn't do so until I had more information about it.</PARA>

We had a spectacular demonstration of that leadership at work last week when the Prime Minister intervened with the parties, persuaded them to go down the path of negotiation, and persuaded them to take the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission, where it now resides and where decisions are now emerging that you find equally alarming because they reassert the primacy of the principle of collective bargaining and because they reassert the role of the trade unions in the industrial and corporate life of this country.

The government has before it the issue of the IC's report on hardware, software and related service industries. It will respond to that report in the innovation statement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of things that could be said about a suggestion to abolish the computer bounty. Firstly, the computer bounty is costed into budget projections to the end of this year&mdash;that is, to the end of December 1995. If the bounty were not extended there would be no savings because there are no forward estimates to provide for it. This S&amp;T policy of the opposition proposes to take the savings that do not exist and fund a raft of other proposals in the science and technology area. These are not rubbery figures; they are imaginary figures. This is not just simply fiddling the books; this is in fact spending money that does not exist.

The question that was asked was whether the government intended to extend the computer bounty after it expires at the end of this year. After 13 years in government and with this particular bounty about to expire, I would have thought it is about time you told us whether or not you are going to extend it. That is a reasonable question to ask and we should be pleased that it has been asked. Why won't the minister simply answer that question rather than get into a debate?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Yesterday in response to a question from me about the likely size of the budget deficit for 1995-96, in the light of the government's planned expenditure increases since the budget in May and its actual and likely further shortfalls in its asset sales program, the minister chastised the opposition for forcing his government to adhere to its own 1993 election promise of no new taxes when the proposed new builders hardware tax was voted down in the Senate. So I now give him the opportunity, following his failure in the last question, to tell us something today about his government's policy. I ask: will he indicate today what he refused to do yesterday, that is, whether the Labor Party, as part of its 1996 election platform, will rule out the introduction of any new taxes, or can purchasers of builders' hardware expect the same again in the unlikely event that you are given another opportunity? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

What I said in answer to the particular question you put to me yesterday&mdash;this is a different question to the particular question put to me yesterday&mdash;was that the government had got the budget into surplus this budgetary year, and the opposition, combined with the Australian Democrats, voted down some of the bills that guaranteed that surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of such claims which are being made by a Mr Warren Entsch, the Liberal candidate for the seat of Leichhardt in northern Queensland. He makes a number of claims in the press&mdash;none directed to me as the responsible minister, so the Senate can draw its own conclusions as to his motives&mdash;but then says that, because I have not rebuked him, his claims cannot be wrong. As he continues to make these false and misleading assertions, I will now use this opportunity to certainly put him straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His claims are wrong and they show either an unwillingness to take into account information I have already put on the public record on this matter or, more disturbingly, I presume he wishes to push these misinterpretations for his own political purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Islander plane used in the current contract in the Torres Strait certainly is not as fast and does not have the range of the Shrike in the previous contract. We do not have any argument with that. The inference that Mr Entsch then draws that it cannot meet the terms of the contract is totally incorrect. As conveyed to Senator MacGibbon on 28 August this year in response to his question on notice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Request for Proposal (RFP) process was used for the surveillance contracts because it was the best method of letting a complex contract. In the RFP process no specification is detailed as an essential premise is an ability to measure proposals against a requirement, then pick the one which best meets the overall needs. Performance requirements which must be met by the contractor are then written into the final contract. This is a different process from that found in the Request for Tender situation where a specification is published in the expectation that tenderers will fully comply with that specification.</PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Entsch's arguments about the capabilities of components in the integrated contract, in isolation from the total outcome, are misleading at best and deliberately mischievous at worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, and particularly for Senator Macdonald, the performance differential in the Torres Strait sector with the previous contract is that, firstly, surveillance aircraft will fly 3,300 hours a year with the two Islander aircraft and slightly more crew, which is an eight per cent increase after the speed differential between the Islander aircraft and the Shrike used in the previous contract is taken into account. Secondly, at 400 hours a year there is a 27 per cent increase in helicopter flights, including flights now with night vision. Thirdly, in addition there will be 520 hours a year of flights by the Reims F406 aircraft, capable of night-time and electronic surveillance&mdash;a capability that was not in the previous contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration of surveillance as an integrated system and the improvement to this system that the new contracts will bring will result in an increase of visual surveillance coverage of around 26 per cent for the Torres Strait, which is the most intensively patrolled area in terms of Coastwatch activity. In addition, there will be a very substantial increase in electronic surveillance. This Coastwatch contract is certainly an increase in capability, especially for the Torres Strait. But, of course, we have the opposition, including Senator Macdonald, going around saying it is declining when in fact it has been increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that in early October this year I inspected the Coastwatch operation in Torres Strait. I spoke to the officers from Coastwatch and asked them about Senator Macdonald's last effort in saying we should try to find a man in a red hat.

The date of 2020 is one that Dr Mahathir has persistently articulated as, in his vision of the future of Malaysia, the date by which Malaysia will become a developed country in every sense of that term. Certainly, Malaysia is the second freest of the ASEAN economies at the moment after Singapore, and is eminently well equipped in terms of the nature and shape and pace of development of its economy to meet these sorts of targets. It is a precaution that Malaysia has insisted on articulating at all stages of this process, that they are not going to regard themselves as bound.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in a sense, there are no sanctions, there is no knee on the neck of anybody in terms of meeting these objectives.

That is the context in which that particular statement should be seen. I do not think that anybody participating in the APEC meeting had any doubt but that Malaysia was serious about continuing to be an effective contributing player in this exercise as it has been right from the outset.</PARA>

It has certainly been the practice of Western Australia and it is the practice of Western Australia in its payments, less than generous though they may be, that they are applying in this particular case. They are still significantly, as I understand it, above legal aid rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As to the question of unfairness involved in all of this, of course it might well be thought to be unfair if legal aid funds were in fact being reduced by meeting these sorts of costs on a basis that is more generous than that available under legal aid, but the truth of the matter, of course, is that this comes out of totally separate pools and there is no question of competing for scarce funds in a single legal aid pool. If there was, there would be some more point, I think, to your question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> You have referred to people in similar circumstances receiving legal aid. I think the final point to be made is it is very hard to envisage anyone being caught up in similar circumstances to that which Dr Lawrence is here in a legal aid context because the situations are hardly comparable. Dr Lawrence find herself in this situation not as a result of any criminal or civil action being taken against her, the normal context, of course, in which legal aid issues arise. Rather, she finds herself being the subject of a manifestly politically inspired witch hunt which is made against her solely on the basis that she is a federal minister, and a highly effective, competent and honest one at that. That is the circumstance that makes her case very different from that which might be thought to arise in any legal aid situation anywhere in the country, and that adds further point, I think, to the wisdom of the position that has been taken on this matter from the outset by the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for that answer, but I wonder if the minister could advise the Senate whether an ordinary citizen finding herself or himself before a commission inquiry of that type and seeking legal aid, because she or he is at risk, would be paid at legal aid rates or would be paid at the rate that, as the minister says, are commercial practice? Is he aware that there is a 20 per cent reduction of commercial practice rates for legal aid?  Finally, would he be prepared to submit the invoices to an independent taxing authority to establish whether they are fair and reasonable, rather than the Government Solicitor?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That supplementary question is really based on a false premise. There is no situation of which I am aware that a witness before a royal commission or someone the subject of a royal commission inquiry who might be thought to be at risk as a result of royal commission proceedings has been thrown on the mercy of legal aid or would need to have recourse to the legal aid commissions in various states or the Commonwealth, as the case may be. I am simply not aware of that situation arising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens in those situations&mdash;and royal commission budgets are geared accordingly when they are set in train&mdash;is that people thought to be at risk, usually subject to some certification procedure by the royal commissioner, are entitled to access to the legal assistance funds made available as part of the funding of the costs of the particular royal commission in question and, when that happens, those funds are made payable in accordance with a formula with bears much more relationship to the fair and reasonable formula by reference to normal commercial standards than normal legal aid standards. We might lament, as we all do, the extraordinary cost of legal assistance in this country and the paucity of funds for legal aid, but the situations are not comparable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>I today gave Senator Cook, on behalf of the government, the clearest possible invitation&mdash;and, indeed, I gave it to him yesterday also&mdash;to ease the concerns that millions of Australians have that Labor, if re-elected at the next election, will not increase taxes or introduce any new taxes. Yesterday and again today the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) refused to give that assurance to the Australian people. The best he could do was say that the government did not intend to introduce any new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not good enough. We have heard those statements time and time again in the past only to have them completely abrogated in terms of action when the election is out of the way. The government then raised taxes. The last election was perhaps the best example we have seen in the 12 years that this government has been in office of its duplicity on taxation policy and what it says before an election and what it does after an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in the clearest terms that the government would not introduce any new taxes after the election. He went to great pains to point out very rudely to those who questioned him on the proposed personal income tax cuts that had been promised before the election that they would be honoured because they were enshrined in l-a-w, law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It subsequently emerged the very week after the election that the Prime Minister entered into discussions with the then Treasurer John Dawkins to dishonour the promise in relation to the second huge tranche of tax cuts&mdash;the $8 billion or so in tax cuts. That is precisely what happened. The government dishonoured that promise. As a result, the taxpayer expectation of a $5 1/2 billion tax cut to take effect from 1 January 1996 was thrown out the window as if it had never existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a promise that quite arguably won the election for Mr Keating in 1993. It was an election campaign based on lies and more lies. The Australian public is extremely concerned that the same is going to happen again next time. What happened after the 1993 election apart from the dishonouring of the major promise for personal income tax cuts? We had, contrary to all the promises before the election, a raft of sales tax increases across all items to which sales tax applies&mdash;that is, from motor vehicles down to many foodstuffs; all those items to which that discriminatory sales tax applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, though; the government then sought to impose sales tax for the first time on a whole raft of new items&mdash;the most notorious one of which was the builders hardware items. We saw the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, representing the Treasurer, chastise me and chastise the coalition in the last two days for drawing attention to the fact that the government had broken its promises in that regard, by putting the imposition of the tax on, and chastise us for trying to keep them honest and adhering to their election promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that there is an insatiable demand by this government for increased expenditure. It is now going for another net $1 billion of expenditure over and above what was budgeted for. That coupled with a shortfall in its asset sales is going to make it absolutely certain that, after the next election, taxes would be increased if this government were returned. If this government had any sense of decency and propriety, it would get up now and state its tax policies and its tax intentions. The Australian people demand to know what the Labor Party's policy is in the area of taxation and all those areas that are of great concern to the Australian people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I must inform honourable senators that I mean it genuinely, because I do generally try to uphold the standards of this chamber, but there are times when one is confronted with&mdash;and I dare not use the word `hypocritical'&mdash;quite incredible propositions from this man who purports to be a minister of the Crown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have school children up in the gallery watching this debate today, and they probably watched the minister tell them how fantastic this nation is, and for young people that is most important. I say to those young people: just be very careful of what these ministers in this government say to you. They will tell you that the economy is all hunky-dory and their policies have delivered us this absolute nirvana of economic good news. They say, `Everything will be fantastic. Don't worry, you'll get a job.' That is what Minister Cook will tell you in his answers in this place and in his speeches around this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to those students and perhaps their economics teacher at their school, if they have one, or another teacher, that they get any copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist </EMPHASIS>magazine, available at newsstands and probably in most school libraries, which will show them in the back two or three pages the situation Australia is in in relation to the rest of the world. For example, you only need to look at what the minister says about our state of economic nirvana, how we have achieved this sustainable economic growth and how this will help everybody find jobs and find a sustainable economic future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer all Australian citizens and honourable senators to the latest edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist </EMPHASIS>where it looks at consumer price rises, known in the community as inflation&mdash;the increase in prices. In the last quarter Australia was ranked as having the highest inflation in the Western world, yet this minister and this government will have us believe that we are a low inflation sustainable growth nation. The reality is entirely the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In international terms we are not in the middle of the field in inflation rates, as we were during the previous coalition government under Malcolm Fraser and John Howard, where we were around middle ranking for most of the government and low inflation for much of it. We are the nation with the highest inflation in the Western world. That is an absolutely appalling statistic, yet we all tend to ignore it. Why do people ignore it? Because all of these government ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), come in here and say that everything is okay and that we are a low inflation nation. They say that their great achievement of this second Keating government is to have low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In black and white and in the most respected international economic magazine we are actually the nation with the highest inflation. What does the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist </EMPHASIS>poll of international forecasters predict for Australia next year, 1996? Again, they are saying that we will have the second highest rate of inflation for 1996 and the highest rate for this year, but we will be amongst the highest inflation nations in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the highest interest rates in the world. We should look statistically at where home mortgage rates were. In his answer today Senator Cook was talking about how Australian citizens have to battle with high interest rates and how this government has helped to keep them down. The cold hard fact is that our real home interest rates&mdash;that is, when you get the base rate of interest, which you will see written in paint on the bank window trying to sell you a mortgage and have that deflated by people's expectations of inflation, that is, the price rises&mdash;under this government are actually five times higher than when they came into power in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other sad thing about this is that the government will not show the people any policy solutions to the malaise they have caused to the Australian nation. They keep telling us that they are going to have this innovation statement, which I understand will be called `Innovating nation', already dubbed by Labor backbenchers as the bronze medal strategy of Senator Cook. Yet they will not tell us what is in it, they will not tell us how they will pay for it and they will not rule out new taxes to pay for it. This government is in turmoil. The Australian people deserve some policy answers. We deserve to see what policy solutions they have for the problems that they have very uniquely created. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) made great play out of the fact that people appearing either as witnesses or as subjects of inquiry before royal commissions or similar tribunals do not as a rule get legal aid. That is not really the point. The point I was making is that, in principle, the same situation applies. Here we have a minister asking for assistance from public funds to cover her legal costs before a tribunal. On the other hand, we have hundreds and thousands of Australian citizens approaching public funds for assistance to cover their legal costs in court proceedings which affect them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the minister that this is entirely analogous. The question that needs to be asked is: should the same principle apply, or do we say to a minister appearing before a tribunal that whatever it takes may go ahead? Was it really carte blanche? Did the government at any stage cap the fees that were to be charged, the costs that were to be incurred? Did the government at any stage participate in the decisions that were made in terms of the strategy of the court cases and challenges that the minister undertook which inevitably would result in higher costs to be met out of the public purse? The questions relate to government accountability. Has the government simply written a blank cheque? Is the government now asking the Senate to co-sign that blank cheque, or has the government put in provisos, protections or monitoring devices to ensure that the public purse is not taken to the cleaners?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects of my supplementary question that the minister did not have time to answer, and I wonder whether he could do so now. One of them is whether the government is prepared to have the bills that are provided through Dr Lawrence taxed by an independent costing authority rather than the Australian Government Solicitor. Secondly, since the minister mentioned normal commercial practice, is he aware that in cases where legal aid is providing the funds it is normal practice for the fees to be reduced by 20 per cent before they are paid by legal aid?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to canvass again the issues that were travelled in question time itself but, as to the further questions that Senator Spindler just then asked, I am of course aware that there is a cost reduction factor normally applied in legal aid payments. What that figure is from jurisdiction to jurisdiction I cannot confirm, but I have no doubt that there is a discount factor involved. But the point here is that, for reasons I have already spelt out, we do not regard that as a strictly comparable or relevant criterion to apply in making the calculation as to what payment ought to be made here. That has not been the practice in the past in the Commonwealth or at any state level in comparable situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other question about whether we would be prepared to have the bills taxed by an independent costing authority, I will see whether the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has anything more to say on that particular subject. My understanding is that the Australian Government Solicitor is quite familiar with the principles to be applied in the taxing of costs. We have a natural instinct to reduce the call upon Treasury funds, consolidated revenue, as much as is humanly possible. </PARA>

The question relates to the public concern in the aviation industry about the awarding of the latest Coastwatch contract. There are a lot of answers to be made. I have put a number of questions on notice over the last year and they have never been satisfactorily answered by the minister for customs, who is the minister responsible. This will probably end up as a Senate inquiry because there is such a degree of concern about the process that was followed in awarding the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer that was given by Senator Schacht today related to the selection of an aircraft known as the Pilatus Britten-Norman Islander, which is universally recognised as being quite unsuitable for the task that Customs wishes to use it for. It is an aeroplane that is very slow, it has a very limited payload and it has a limited range. It is very hard to see out of&mdash;and it is being used for a visual task&mdash;and it is very noisy. It is not a habitable aircraft at all for long periods of crew duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht is arguing that, instead of a contract being let, they used an RFP this time&mdash;a request for proposal. When the request for proposal was issued there were certain base parameters laid down. Senator Schacht is arguing, in an attempt to justify this odd decision, that because it was an RFP and not a request for a tender, the government or Customs has the ability to then sit down with the tenderer and agree to different standards. What happened in this situation was that they agreed to standards that were considerably lower than they were asking for in their RFP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very inadequate aircraft, as I said. It is very slow. It is range-limited. It is an aircraft that is going to operate in the northern part of Australia. This time of the year onwards, for the next three or four months, it will be operating in the wet season. It cannot take off under instrument flight rules with the load that it can under the visual flight rules. I am advised that it has to fly for something like 90 minutes before it can go IFR in conditions which will apply for a large part of the year. Because of its limited capabilities, there are increases in the cost of operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are allegations that the company sought to get an increase in the maximum all-up weight of the aircraft which was denied by CASA, or the Civil Aviation Authority as it was known at the time. The aircraft does not possess any effective airconditioning. Airconditioning in the tropics at low level, at which this aircraft operates, is not a luxury; it is essential for the minimisation of crew fatigue and for the electronic equipment that is on board. The humidity can be in the high 90s to 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is alleged that, in relation to the Australian Customs Service, in May 1994 two officers came up from Canberra, chartered a Britten-Norman Islander in Cairns, flight tested it and found that it was completely unsuited to the Customs role. The request for the RFP that went out called for a minimal speed of 130 knots. This aircraft is flat out making 115 knots on the cruise. The concern in Queensland is that with an inadequate aircraft like that, and with the gateway to the north, which is vitally important from a migration point of view, as is the papaya fruit fly from a Customs and quarantine point of view, those standards are not going to be met. Nothing that Senator Schacht said today in any way dispelled the concerns that exist about how the aircraft was selected, how the contract was awarded and how the quarantine and customs duties are going to be dispensed in the north under this new contract. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Entsch has been approached by quite a large number of people with concerns, some of which have been raised by my colleague Senator MacGibbon in his questions on notice some time ago. We are fortunate to have someone like Senator MacGibbon, who does understand the technicalities of these answers that are given. Senator Schacht, in response to Senator MacGibbon's questions, did try to go on with some technicalities. I am pleased that Senator MacGibbon has been able today to indicate just how poor those answers were and how lacking in any substance they really were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great concern about the way this contract has been let. Many honourable senators may remember that there was a lot of concern about the previous Coastwatch contract and the way that it had been let. One would have thought the government would have been extra careful this time in the way the contract was let. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of concern about the type and the suitability of the aircraft being used. There is a lot of concern about the amount of equipment that is available to the Customs officers to do their surveillance. There is a lot of concern about the placement of those aircraft and the equipment. All of this has been quite clearly and properly raised by Mr Warren Entsch, the Liberal candidate for Leichhardt, in his role as having a concern for the people of Cairns and all parts of Far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht used the opportunity of a dorothy dix question simply to attack genuine Far North Queenslanders who are interested in their area. He carried on in his childish way and attacked me over an issue I raised here in the same vein many months ago&mdash;now an issue which really involves the bringing of drugs into this country through the Torres Strait. All Senator Schacht can do is laugh about it and laugh about the man with the red hat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not so long after I raised these issues and concerns with Senator Schacht that indeed the Customs Service did have a major drug catch on the mainland in Bamaga, Far North Queensland. But it was not the surveillance of Customs that found that. As I said in the parliament the other day, some people in Mackay had reported that someone had come along and paid cash to buy an aircraft. It was as a result of that information that Customs eventually made the apprehension. But the concern was that the aircraft went all through the Torres Strait and on to the mainland of Australia, past all the surveillance safeguards we supposedly have up in the Torres Strait area and landed at Bamaga before it was apprehended following this tip-off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Clerk of the Senate subsequently wrote to the committee on 31 October 1995 expressing concern about subclause 48(5). The main concerns of the clerk were, firstly, that there was no useful purpose to statutory provisions, such as these, which sought to recognise a parliamentary procedure which other statutory provisions and its own practices already allow. The clerk also suggested that the drafting of the amendments was vague and uncertain and, in any event, attempted to deal with concepts which could not be enacted satisfactorily. For instance, the government amendments provided for a rule-maker to hold discussions with a house, which is not possible. Also, the amendments could be used to prevent a senator from raising an issue. Debate on a motion could be avoided, which would be a dangerous precedent. Finally, the amendments do not advance parliamentary control over delegated legislation, because it is still the Senate which is the ultimate arbiter of whether an instrument is disallowed.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1994 REVISED SUBSTITUTE GOVERNMENT AMENDMENTS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week a set of government amendments to the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, designated as revised substitute amendments, were circulated. One of the provisions in these amendments is of concern and I wish to draw it to the attention of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment no. 78 would insert into clause 48 of the bill a new subclause (5). The Senate Department was asked to comment on this provision before the amendments were circulated, but subject to a very severe deadline for the printing and circulation of the amendments. In the short time available I suggested a change of wording to the new subclause 48(5), but was not able to undertake a proper analysis of the proposed provision. I indicated that I could see problems with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed new subclause (5) provides that, if a disallowance motion is deferred by a House and a new instrument is made amending, repealing or replacing the instrument which is the subject of the disallowance motion, the House may discharge the disallowance motion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The supplementary explanatory memorandum accompanying the amendments does not explain the rationale of this proposed provision, but merely restates its terms, as is usual with explanatory memoranda in recent times. It does not appear to arise from the recommendations of the committee or any previous consideration of the bill. Remarks made during the brief consultation to which I have referred suggested that the purpose of the proposed provision is to formalise the practice whereby a disallowance motion in the Senate is withdrawn when an amending instrument is made which overcomes the objection to the original instrument which was the subject of the disallowance motion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are several difficulties with the proposed provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first place, there would appear to be no particular reason for formalising the practice whereby disallowance motions are disposed of when a satisfactory amending instrument is made. The proposed provision merely indicates that the Senate may do that which other statutory provisions and its own practices already allow. Unless there is some useful purpose to be served by enacting statutory provisions which merely recognise parliamentary procedures, they should be avoided because they may unintentionally restrict those procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, in attempting to give statutory expression to the practice which is particularly associated with the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, a practice which cannot be statutory codified, the proposed provision creates vagueness and uncertainty. It refers to the making of a new instrument after discussion with a House. It is not indicated how a rule-maker can discuss anything with a House; discussions can be held with the chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee when the committee has come to a view about an instrument, but discussions cannot be held with the Senate, particularly as the Senate may not have any agreed view about an instrument. The proposed provision does not say that the new instrument is to overcome the objections to the original instrument which are the basis of the disallowance motion, obviously because this concept cannot be statutory enacted, but the concept is absolutely central to the practice which the provision attempts to codify. Under that practice, disallowance motions are not withdrawn unless a new instrument or an undertaking overcomes the objections to the original instrument of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee or of the senator who has given the notice. The proposed subclause (5), in conjunction with proposed new subclause (6), would give a special status to an instrument which is not required by the terms of the provision to achieve the goal of overcoming the objection to the original instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the proposed provision refers to a House discharging a motion to disallow the original instrument. The draft provision as originally shown to me provided for a House to "move a motion to rescind the motion to disallow". I pointed out that Houses do not move motions, that moving a motion is not the same as passing a motion, and that it is impossible to rescind a motion, as only a resolution, that is, a motion which has been passed, can be rescinded. I suggested the wording which now appears in the proposed subclause, but indicated that there was still a serious problem with it. The procedures of the Senate follow the principle that a notice of motion, before it has been moved and has become the property of the Senate, is entirely in the control of the senator who has given the notice. It is for that senator to determine whether the notice will be proceeded with. This is an important principle because, if the Senate could dispose of a senator's notice of motion before it is actually moved, this would open up enormous scope for a majority to interfere with a senator's right to initiate business; such a process could be used to prevent matters even being raised. The proposed provision would thus introduce a dangerous procedural novelty, a resolution by the Senate to discharge a notice of motion. If the subclause were enacted there would be a statutory provision for a procedure in relation to disallowance motions which is alien to the procedure applying to all other motions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourthly, by attempting in this inadequate way to codify a parliamentary practice, the proposed subclause would open up an avenue for possible abuse. If a government thought that it had the support of a majority of the Senate to dispose of an embarrassing disallowance motion without being forced to debate or vote on it, a new instrument could be made without overcoming the objection to the original instrument which is the subject of a deferred disallowance motion, and a motion could then be moved to discharge the disallowance motion, thereby preventing the senator concerned from moving the motion, and avoiding the necessity of debating the motion and voting against it directly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifthly, having unnecessarily created these difficulties, the proposed provision would not advance parliamentary control over delegated legislation in the slightest degree. If a notice of motion for disallowance has reached the time for determination, whether or not it is deferred under the proposed provisions of clause 48, the Senate must decide whether to proceed with the disallowance of the instrument, either by agreeing to the motion or by allowing the statutory period to expire, or to allow the withdrawal of the notice of motion. In making that decision the Senate may have regard to either ministerial undertakings in relation to the instrument in question or a new instrument which may have been made. In making its decision and in having regard to those matters, the Senate would not be assisted in any way by the proposed new subclause (5).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I therefore suggest that the proposed new subclause should not be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the committee so wishes I would be pleased to elaborate on or clarify this submission.</PARA>

The committee is grateful for their assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that, while it would not oppose the amendments, it was desirable for them to be amended in light of the difficulties noted by the clerk and discussed at the special meeting. This would involve deletion of all references to a house in proposed new subclause 48(5), which would instead merely refer to the existing practice, most often associated with the committee, where a notice of disallowance has been given in respect of an instrument and where a new instrument is made to overcome parliamentary concerns about the original instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also concluded that drafting changes were necessary to proposed new subclauses 48(6) and (7), which provide that a rule-maker is not required to enter into further consultation about a new instrument although, with several exceptions, the new instrument will be subject to the other provisions of the bill. Here also the committee concluded that an inappropriate reference to a house should be removed, while more safeguards for the public should be included. These safeguards were to make it clear that, while further consultation was not mandatory for new instruments, it was to be encouraged where appropriate that the explanatory statement should indicate whether such consultation had taken place and, if so, the nature of the consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of the suggested changes to the government amendments is that consultation procedures for instruments made to overcome parliamentary concerns about earlier instruments will be less restrictive than the far from onerous consultation requirements for other instruments. These new consultation procedures would, however, include appropriate safeguards for the public which are lacking in the present government amendments.</PARA>

<PARA>This was a good idea, the teleservice centres. It meant that people&mdash;I think the new word is `clients'&mdash;could ring up the Department of Social Security and seek to have their problems resolved, where they could, over the phone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it does not seem to have worked as well as it should have. For example, the cost was supposed to be $40 million a year in 1992-93 prices. In fact, it has blown out by 40 per cent to $56 million. It does not provide anything like the service that it was supposed to provide. It is grossly inadequate. The Auditor-General has noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Teleservice operations have had difficulty in meeting performance standards relating to the key client service objectives set for the initiative.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a polite Auditor-General's remark for saying it has not worked properly. Not only has not it worked properly; it has cost far more than it should have and the Department of Social Security has to do something about it. The audit finding was that:</PARA>

<PARA>It adds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teleservice Centres can be better integrated into DSS operations for better overall performance.</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSS has largely accepted the ANAO recommendations . . . As a result, management of the Teleservice function has improved.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say some of the figures quoted in the audit report do not suggest they have improved at all. They seem to suggest, in fact, that some of the services are getting worse. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the ANAO considers that the extent of the problems are such that more fundamental changes along the lines outlined in this report should be considered by DSS management to deliver administratively effective and efficient Teleservice operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSS has indicated that many of the fundamental changes required are constrained by the APS industrial relations and budgeting environment.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While acknowledging such difficulties, the ANAO suggests that management has to set priorities and achieve the balance necessary between resourcing and other operational concerns and he achievement of program objectives, of which quality client service delivery is acknowledged to be an important element.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, performance has fallen short of the standards and expectations set initially with respect to both client service and operating efficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA>The report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Difficulties with resourcing models, staffing arrangements, client service, quality control and assurance, integration and configuration have continued to hamper Teleservice operations. Action in train and proposed by DSS should do much to overcome such difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, it is a fairly damning report, as is evident from that summary. However, when you go to the report in detail, you find that these problems have resulted in a degree of frustration with the teleservice centre operations amongst people who use them, that is, what is now called the DSS client base. There has been disaffection with teleservice centre operations within the Department of Social Security regional office network itself and insufficient priority has been given to resolving the fundamental problems facing teleservice centre operations. A good deal of frustration and pressure is being felt by teleservice centre operators, supervisors and management. That is bad enough. The service, in other words, is grossly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the service being grossly inadequate, a table on page 35 of the report reveals the target service levels set by the Department of Social Security for the percentage of calls answered by an operator within one minute of the client making the call. The original target set by the department was that 98 per cent of calls were going to be answered within one minute. It became obvious that they would never reach that sort of target so they changed it to 85 per cent, and it remains at 85 per cent. That is just ludicrous, because not one teleservice centre has met anything like that 85 per cent target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Sydney, for example, only 23 per cent of calls were answered within one minute. That is all&mdash;only 23 per cent. That means that 77 per cent of calls involved people hanging on for longer than one minute. We do not know how much longer than one minute because they have not measured how long people have to hang on before they receive attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney situation is continually worsening. When the program started in July-December 1993&mdash;that is when 98 per cent was the target&mdash;only 52 per cent of calls were answered within one minute. In January-June 1994 it deteriorated from 52 per cent to 32 per cent. In July-December 1994 it worsened to 31 per cent. In the later six months to June this year it has fallen to 23 per cent. A constant worsening of the situation; a constantly worse service being provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney is not the only example. There are some other areas where the service is pretty terrible too. In Brisbane, which is separated into A and B centres, the percentage of calls being answered within one minute is now down to 27 per cent for Brisbane A and 29 per cent for Brisbane B. Most other centres are well under half of their target level of 85 per cent. The current operational arrangements for teleservice centres, as the Auditor-General says, have failed to deliver on this aspect of access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, not only does it take so long to answer the calls, the hours in which the services are available are grossly inadequate in comparison with what the target initially was. Extended hours of access were intended when the service was launched, as reflected in the minister's statement of March 1992, which envisaged teleservice centres offering extended service to Social Security clients through the transfer of calls between the teleservice centres in different time zones. There were to be wider hours of access, either through call shedding or extended operational hours, which were, according to the minister, to be of particular benefit to those clients with families, clients working or seeking work and those who are full-time carers enabling them to obtain access at more convenient times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it just has not happened. Current operational arrangements for teleservice centres have failed to deliver on this aspect of access. Teleservice centres operate from Monday to Friday only between 8.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m.&mdash;essentially, the traditional opening times for the existing regional office network&mdash;and there is no call shedding between teleservice centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have an inadequate service and a much more expensive service. As I said, it went up by 40 per cent from the forecast of $40 million to $56 million. This increase in running costs occurred even though current call volumes were close to those estimated in 1992 and they did not have the expenses of having extended hours. Those components of costs that have contributed most to the higher ongoing resourcing requirements for teleservice operations have been labour costs and call costs. Wage costs have remained high as a result of the inability to achieve the staffing economies expected from teleservice centres. There is an immense amount of work to be done yet to make this either an efficient or an effective service. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)a proposal that satisfactory arrangements are in place has been approved as specified in subsection 7(2).".</PARA>
<PARA>The reasons behind these amendments in the committee stage are as follows. Amendment No. 1 would make it clear that it is the parliament's intention that Sydney and Sydney West airports should not be leased until the aircraft noise burden is spread more equitably. Amendment No. 2 would remove Sydney airport and Sydney West airport from the list of core regulated airports in clause 7 of the Airports Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is structured so the government can add additional airports to the list of core regulated airports by regulation. So coalition amendment No. 3 would prevent the government from adding Sydney airport and Sydney West airport to the list by regulation. Coalition amendment No. 3 makes it clear that new airports can only be added to the list subject to a new subsection 7(2). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition amendment No. 4 would enact the first of our two conditions that I set out in my speech in the second reading debate yesterday. It would add a new subsection 7(2) which would prevent the government from leasing Sydney and Sydney West airports unless it first developed a strategy for increasing the use of the east-west runway. The strategy would have to be endorsed by parliament. Amendment No. 5 is simply a machinery measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Airports (Transitional) Bill are similar to the amendments to the Airports Bill. Amendment No. 1 would make it clear that it is parliament's intention that Sydney and Sydney West airports should not be leased until the aircraft noise burden is spread more equitably. Amendment No. 2 would remove Sydney and Sydney West from the list of leaseable airports in section 19 of the bill. The section currently allows the government to add airports to the list of leaseable airports by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments Nos 4 and 5 would prevent the government from putting Sydney and Sydney West back onto the list by regulation unless it first developed a strategy for increasing the use of the east-west runway. Finally, coalition amendment No. 3 would add Adelaide airport to the list of leaseable airports, thus carrying out the second condition that I raised in my speech in the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the government's hands as to whether these bills are passed. I think the Democrats and the Greens have made it quite clear they do not believe in privatisation of any sort, so they do not intend to support these bills. We have moved two sets of amendments as a result of government policy decisions. These decisions had nothing to do with safety at the time, which has been thrown around this place ad nauseam. The two major policy decisions of this government were, first of all, to close the east-west runway and then to narrow the flight corridors north and south of the airport. This has been made very clear to me in my capacity on the select committee that is looking at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's policy decision to narrow the corridors has meant that they, the government, have determined the flight corridors, the flight paths. I would have thought of that as being an extremely silly thing, a stupid thing. Under this government 13 months ago we had two runways at Sydney, both of which were active. On 4 November 1994, the new runway was completed. It was opened ahead of time&mdash;again, resulting from a policy decision by Minister Brereton. No-one is too sure as to why that was done, because the control tower was not operational. But the effect of that was to send something like double or triple the number of aircraft north of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of that, of course, was that we had blockades led, I might say, by Labor Party stalwarts like Barry Cotter, the Mayor of Marrickville, in what Senator Forshaw in his speech on the second reading referred to as the over-Labor electorates. I might say that I was somewhat amazed by that comment from Senator Forshaw. He was sort of congratulating the government because they had directed aircraft over Labor-run electorates, and he spoke of Sydney, Grayndler and Lowe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about that is that it just shows the utter disregard by this Labor government for constituents in electorates it does not think it can lose&mdash;and did not think it could lose. We had ministers in the other place saying that the reason we were requesting this was for a handful of votes in the seat of Bennelong. Anyone knows darn well that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, is not going to lose his seat in Bennelong under any circumstances; no way in the world is that going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have the curious situation of the coalition being concerned about the fact that people, the so-called `true believers', have been let down and abused by their own party which they have supported for many years. So it is a curious situation in that here it is the coalition&mdash;and this, I suppose, reflects the broad nature of the coalition: a party which is not subject to a particular single interest vested group, in the way in which the Labor Party is&mdash;which is prepared to show some concern for the people on whom one of the great disasters of Sydney has been inflicted. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does; that is right, Senator Forshaw. That is a good interjection. The reason that a minority on that committee supported the new runway was simply so that there would be more aircraft going to or coming from the south. That would have, in effect, lowered the burden of the people who had traditionally been affected by aircraft noise, whether they were on the east, the west or the north.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage, with the proposal made by the Federal Airports Corporation, it was never suggested that instead of going from two active runways 13 months ago and ending up with three we would then have a position where only 1 7/8 were active. How stupid can you get; how absolutely stupid can you get. This is the sort of stupidity that comes out of this government because it makes political decisions. It was a straight political decision in 1989; everyone is aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that our first amendment suggests is pretty much the same as we suggested in the previous bill on curfews. We do not want to direct the experts on how to run an airport&mdash;not like Mr Brereton, Mr Keating or Senator Collins. That is what they have done. We want to say to the experts, `You go out and we will give you three active runways; you then make a determination on how to best use that airport, bearing in mind the three competing ends.' And the three competing ends are noise, capacity and safety&mdash;not in any particular order, although safety is paramount, particularly with airports. That is the purpose for the first amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment is to include Adelaide in the sale of the first group of airports. There is a reason for that. The reason is that the people of South Australia wanted it included in that group. The reason for them wanting the Adelaide airport in the first group was to enable them to get on with the job of extending their runway. They believe that by doing so their tourism and trade prospects will be increased. That is a fair request by a state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did we get? We got the minister coming out with another phoney statement&mdash;absolutely phoney. He said, `Don't you realise that, if you go down the opposition line, your extension to Adelaide airport will be delayed.' We were putting it in to bring it forward! When I checked with prospective buyers and all the major financial institutions around the country, they indicated that they saw no problem with Adelaide being included in the first group; in fact, it was said to me by quite a number, `We don't know why it wasn't included in the first place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brereton said that it was going to be delayed. That is interesting, because he had previously given a commitment to the South Australian government that the extension to the Adelaide airport would be provided for in the 1996-97 federal budget. It had nothing whatsoever to do with Sydney airports&mdash;Kingsford Smith or Sydney West. But that is what he said. Mr Brereton is one of the group which goes along with the Graham Richardson book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS>. He will say anything, thinking that people will swallow it. People will not swallow what Minister Brereton says. In fact, he has lost the faith and the trust of everyone in the Sydney area. Hence, the reason for the first amendment. And he is not believed on this particular one either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to be a financial wizard or an accounting expert to recognise that a number of options are open in regard to funding the extension of the Adelaide airport. One is to do what Mr Brereton told South Australian Minister Laidlaw that he would do&mdash;and that is to fund it from the budget. The other one is that, when it is put up for sale, a requirement can be made of the purchaser to provide the extension for the airport. It is one or the other. You either get the taxpayer to do it, or you get the purchaser to do it&mdash;in which case the sale price of the airport will be decreased. It is the old pea and thimble trick: it does not matter which way you do it, it will still be either an increased revenue to the Commonwealth government having extended the runway, or it will be a lower revenue to the government requiring the purchaser to carry out that work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine made a remark in his address about airports. He said that one of the difficulties from the coalition side, and from his as well, is that we do not know what is in the scoping study&mdash;and presumably in there those two items are addressed. It is also interesting to note the reason why the South Australians want this airport brought forward: they believe that by doing so it will speed up the process and achieve the extension to the runway that they should have had, in their view, quite some time ago. They believe that, with private ownership, they will be able to achieve that. I found it interesting to compare that with the views expressed by Senator Harradine, who felt there might be some negatives involved, when in fact the people of South Australia are very keen for it to proceed at a faster rate because they see positives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To recapitulate, there are good reasons as to why our amendments should be supported by the government. It is an opportunity for the government to redress the tragedy that it imposed upon thousands and thousands of residents of Sydney simply because of a political decision. It is an opportunity for the sale process of the airports to go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, the minor parties in this place have indicated they do not like privatisation anyway. The coalition has always supported it on the basis of efficiency, the lowering of costs to consumers and the benefits that come with it. I think the government must admit that it made an awful mistake when it went down the road it did. We are giving it, yet again, the opportunity to correct that mistake and to get this legislation through.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again that, as the minister who was in this portfolio during the EIS process and as the minister who was subjected to constant lobbying from members of the coalition both publicly and privately to get that third runway completed on the basis that the EIS was being carried out&mdash;and this is what Senator Parer chooses to ignore&mdash;the entire EIS was predicated on a lessened use of the east-west runway at Sydney airport right from day one. That is precisely the basis on which the EIS went ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, it is a moot point indeed, post-Sackville particularly, that if these opposition amendments were to be agreed to&mdash;to the horror, I think, of Senator Parer if they were&mdash;a question would be raised as to whether the environmental impact process would have to be completely done again. As Senator Parer knows full well, despite all the dodging, weaving and opportunism he is engaged in at the moment with his party in Sydney, the most strident advocate for the construction of that runway on the basis it is now operating was the coalition. That entire EIS, which took years to complete&mdash;and I think, from memory, cost $7 million to complete&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was $9 million&mdash;thank you, Senator Parer; I knew it was a lot of millions&mdash;was predicated from day one on substantially reduced use of the east-west runway. Indeed all of the global noise projections of the EIS were all based on a redistribution of the noise patterns around Sydney airport with, as there always are in these things, people affected to a greater extent and a substantial number of people affected to a lesser extent.

The opposition says that it gives lip-service to its support for the leasing of the airports. However, if the opposition amendments as proposed were accepted, it would simply stop the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know how this chamber works. We can all see the absolutely transparent attempt that is being made here to subvert the government's program and the government's budget process by paying lip-service to the privatisation of the airports and the leasing of the airports whilst, at the same time, putting up amendments which, so far as Senator Parer is concerned, would secure support here to defeat the process. It is a fairly duplicitous and fairly transparent exercise that is being engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition says that it does not believe the airports can be leased without addressing the noise problems at KSA. Of course that is an utterly spurious position to take&mdash;always has been. To link this situation with Sydney's east-west runway is just absolutely absurd, and Senator Parer knows it. The operation of airport runways at any particular airport has got nothing whatever to do with the regulatory provisions in the Airports Bill&mdash;nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to waste the Senate's time again, as I have said, explaining how poorly the opposition at least pretends not to understand runway operations at Kingsford Smith airport, although, as I suspect, some of them, including Senator Parer, understand it full well. I am also appalled that those opposite chose to ignore the evidence that has been given to the Senate committee that does not suit their case, which is fundamentally all of it. Those opposite have completely ignored the advice they have been given by the people who actually do understand air traffic control and run air traffic control at Sydney airport and also the people who are internationally renowned in Australia for carrying out investigations into the accidents that occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note in this regard the new role that BASI has had for some years. BASI gained this new role when I was minister&mdash;that is, instead of having a reactive role in investigating each and every accident, as it once had to, BASI now has a pro-active role in investigating those accidents that it determines require investigation, particularly those where deaths or serious injury occur, and those accidents that would shed light on safer airways operations. BASI does have that pro-active role. On this occasion, its evidence is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for everyone to see. It indicates just how spurious this position is that the opposition is adopting. Yet where that evidence does not suit the coalition's case it simply ignores it and brushes it aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, though, in respect of that issue that it was with some interest I noted the legislation which the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, has just introduced into the House of Representatives. I made a point in here the last  time we debated this legislation that I thought the most inappropriate&mdash;certainly one of the most, if not the most, inappropriate&mdash;body in Australia to run air traffic control at Sydney airport is the Senate or the federal parliament. I do not know that that would be seriously argued by any reasonable person. It is apparently argued by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of calling game, set and match on that proposition, I simply refer all honourable senators to Mr Howard's legislation. If the legislation that the Leader of the Opposition has introduced into the House of Representatives for the operations of Sydney airport were enacted, it would have the effect of not only reopening the east-west runway for operations of large jet aircraft again but also allowing the east-west runway at Sydney airport to operate 24-hours a day with large jet aircraft operating all the way through the curfew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the legal advice that has been given to me in regard to that piece of legislation. Having read it, I think it is soundly based. As I said, that gives you an absolutely unarguable case, I would have thought, for the point I was making here last week&mdash;that is, this is the most inappropriate forum in which to run air traffic control at Sydney airport, by introducing legislation into this parliament. John Howard has just proven that in spades, I would have thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that this government would prefer to rely on the expert advice that it has received, and continues to receive, from the safety and aviation authorities in this country rather than rely on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition in determining what is the most safe and efficient operation for an airport. I know what Senator Parer's corporate credentials are and I know the philosophical positions he has previously taken in this chamber in relation to many of these issues. I know that Senator Parer knows that to attempt to link the fundamental question of leasing airports in Australia to the operation of the east-west runway at Sydney or any other airport is a spurious argument indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's leasing strategy, which involves the simultaneous sale of the four major airports with cross-ownership restrictions on Sydney and Brisbane as well as Sydney and Melbourne, is absolutely vital to the airport proposal. Acceptance of the opposition's amendments to exclude Sydney and Sydney West would destroy this strategy, cut the level of bidder interest in each of the major airports and significantly reduce budget revenues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the FAC's most valuable and attractive asset, Sydney is the key element in a leasing strategy which reflects expert financial and commercial advice to the government. With the cross-ownership restrictions in place, bidders will not want to bid for other airports, acquisition of which could restrict their ability to bid for Sydney. They would be unable to settle their bidding strategy for the major airports if Sydney were excluded. The exclusion of Sydney and Sydney West will simply sabotage the sale process and unnecessarily delay the vital development of Sydney West. That is precisely the end that the opposition is aiming to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has carefully negotiated with the South Australian government vital runway upgrade works at Adelaide airport as part of its commitment to transport developments in South Australia. The Adelaide community has been pushing for the extension of that runway for many years. The opposition amendments are simply a stunt to divert attention from the priority which should be given to that runway development. The opposition's amendments jeopardise plans for improvements to Adelaide airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to include only the four largest airports and not Adelaide in the first phase of the sale reflects the outcome of the market testing program. That program showed that the focus of investor interest was on the three largest east coast airports and Perth. Frankly, I do not think that will come as a major surprise to anybody. The preference of most potential investors is to secure one of these airports before entertaining a bid for airports such as Adelaide. The government also took account of commercial advice that offering airports such as Adelaide in the first phase could result in a paucity of investor interest in those airports when the focus of investors would be on bidding for the majors. This would not serve South Australia's regional interests well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne has taken the view in this debate&mdash;a view with which I respectfully disagree with&mdash;that the leasing of the airports will automatically lead to worse environmental outcomes due to unfettered private airport development. The Airports Bill strengthens environmental protection from airport operators. At the outset, it should be made clear that the development of airport regulatory arrangements post leasing does not affect the operation of existing legislation and regulations which cover curfews, runway operations, flight path and noise issues and the acquisition and insulation programs for housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bills, as is currently the case, where proposed developments would have a significant environmental impact, the requirement for environmental impact assessments will apply to the airport lessees. The Commonwealth Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act will continue to apply to federal airport developments. However, in addition to these requirements, airport lessees will, under the Airports Bill, be required to develop and implement environmental strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These strategies will include specific measures to be carried out by lessees for preventing, controlling or reducing environmental impacts. The bill requires lessees to take all reasonable steps to comply with environmental strategies and provides ministerial powers to seek injunctions to this effect. These new environmental provisions will help achieve progressive and sustainable improvements in the environmental outcomes at airports post leasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point to Senator Parer that there is no logical connection, and he knows it, between the leasing of airports in Australia and the use of runways at each or any one of those airports. The two things are completely separate. This is simply a stunt and a political strategy to subvert these sales and a bit of grandstanding in Sydney to highlight this wonderful about face that the coalition has engaged in on the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by responding briefly to a point raised by the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Kernot, who questioned the importance of the passage of this legislation at this time. The leasing of airports is a vital element of the government's future budgetary objectives which it will seek to protect. There is still a great deal to be done in the development of regulations which contain the fine detail to major interested parties, including state, territory and local governments. As I mentioned earlier today, that may well be an outcome. Delays to the bills will only create unnecessary uncertainty for all of the parties concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Airports Bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill, backed by pricing and quality of service oversight by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, are an essential part of the establishment of an appropriate framework for the leasing and regulation of federal airports. The bill provides for the separation of the operation of the airports from government regulation of airports in the public interest. I say again to Senator Bourne that leasing of the airports does not impact on existing environmental legislation, regulations or arrangements and airport lessees will not be able to avoid their environmental obligations. </PARA>

Therefore, what we are saying to all the other people who thought they were not going to be dealt with yet is that we are leaving open the ability for an open cheque&mdash;Adelaide or any other airport.

So I am wondering where the wording came from and whether you are actually wanting full support from the Senate for it, because there are a number of problems. There is no mention of any cap on Sydney airport, so what we might be doing here is allowing untrammelled increased use of Sydney airport. I do not think anyone in their right mind, least of all the people in Sydney who are suffering, actually wants there to be a direction which says there will be uncapped use of Sydney airport, and that is basically what you are saying here. </PARA>

We have concerns that we are being asked to sign an open cheque with no consultation at all about any of those people that could be covered under section 19(f).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just rise to make a few comments in respect of these airport bills, particularly the amendment from the opposition with respect to the re-opening of the east-west runway. As Senator Parer said, and I think Senator Collins said too, it has all been said before many times in other debates. So I am not so sure that if people do go and read some of the speeches they will not necessarily have read the report in advance, which is one of the unfortunate aspects of this amendment. That is, Senator Parer and the opposition have very well and truly gazumped their own report by taking one of the key issues of debate before the Senate committee and essentially, having adopted a view very early in those Senate committee deliberations, are now seeking to have it imposed through legislation, even before the report is written.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer continues to run this false argument that the closure or the downgrading of the east-west runway was a political decision. Indeed, they have constantly run this line of argument that the decision to downgrade the east-west runway, when the third runway, the parallel runway, was opened, was politically motivated. We have had the very disgusting argument constantly put that it was done in the interests of protecting Labor members. Of course nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has pointed out, the decision that the east-west runway would be downgraded upon the opening of the new runway was an integral feature of the entire decision to construct the third runway and, indeed, the EIS process. The minister, Senator Collins, once again pointed it out. It has been pointed out on numerous occasions, but the opposition seeks to either deliberately distort the situation or ignore it. Indeed, in many cases they do both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I once again take you back, Senator Parer, to 1988, to the minority report by the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Adequacy of International Terminal and Aircraft handling facilities at Sydney Airport</EMPHASIS>. In that report, the opposition, the minority senators, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important justification for a parallel runway is the dramatic improvement it would provide in bad weather.</PARA>
<PARA>You went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would also halve the number of noise affected residents.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what has happened. The number of residents who are affected by aircraft noise in Sydney now is approximately half the number that were affected when we had cross-runways&mdash;or intersecting runways, as they are otherwise termed&mdash;operating at Sydney; that is, when the east-west runway and the north-south main runway were fully operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So your own statements in that report of 1988 have been borne out in respect of the current operations of the parallel runways; that is, the number of noise affected residents has halved. That has meant that those residents living under the flight path of the east-west runway are no longer as severely affected, if affected at all, by aircraft noise, because of the significant downgrading of the east-west runway. Of course, the east-west runway is only operational these days when prevailing wind conditions do not allow for the normal operation of the parallel runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also recognised and has been constantly recognised that, whilst the number of residents has been halved or significantly reduced, the level of noise has increased. That is conceded and that is recognised and things are being done to alleviate that suffering as much as possible. Short of getting rid of aircraft altogether out of Sydney or closing KSA, which nobody in their right mind suggests, there are unfortunately going to be people living under the flight path of the current runways on the north-south axis who will continue to be affected by noise. What this bill and the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill and the various other arrangements such as the noise abatement scheme are about is to reduce the impact of that noise as far as is humanly possible, as we also endeavour to get Sydney West&mdash;Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek&mdash;operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Collins said, your opposition leader has acknowledged that he was aware that the decision would be to downgrade or close for all intents and purposes the east-west runway. So it is a complete distortion to come in here and argue that Sydney now has only 1 1/2 runways when you thought you were getting a third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more important to look at the impact that this proposal would have. Not only does this hold up the leasing of Kingsford Smith airport, with all of the consequential impacts that we addressed in the second reading debate, but the opposition's proposal, if implemented, would place a huge further economic burden in respect of the number of additional houses that would require insulation. During the Senate inquiry I asked a question on notice of the Department of Transport. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many residences would be eligible for insulation from aircraft noise if the east-west runway were reopened to regular operations and how many would lie within the 20 and 30 ANEF zones?</PARA>
<PARA>The written response has come back from the Department of Transport, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the approximately 6,000 residences within the 30 ANEF under the cross-runway scenario, some 3,700 are on the alignment of the east-west runway. In the event of a return to regular cross-runway operations, there would therefore be some 8,000 residences eligible for insulation if it is assumed that all residences currently eligible for insulation maintain their eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA>That means that there are currently identified some 4,300 homes which are eligible for the insulation, airconditioning and other alterations that are needed to reduce the level of noise. If this proposal were to be implemented and we bring back into full operation the east-west runway, that will add another 3,700 homes that will once again become severely affected by aircraft noise and increase to 8,000 in total the number of residents who, quite rightly, would be eligible to put their hand up and say, `We are entitled to the benefits of this insulation program.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer is already aware of the huge cost of that program and the complexities involved. His so-called `sharing the load' solution is to add another 3,700 residences in Sydney to the number to be put through not only increased noise but also the inconvenience and the other disturbances brought about because of the necessity for insulation, airconditioning and so on. On top of that, whilst you are strangling the process of the leasing of Kingsford Smith airport and depriving the process of the revenue from that sale, which is, in turn, a fundamental part of the proposal for the construction of Badgerys Creek, you are also adding another huge cost burden to this issue. But you do not seem to care about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called economic rationalists are those who are so concerned about ensuring that government expenditure is reigned in&mdash;this Thatcherite approach that has been long followed by the Leader of the Opposition and his party. When it comes to this issue, for the basest of political motives you are prepared to say, `Let's hold up this bill, let's delay the leasing of Kingsford Smith airport, let's throw the whole program regarding solving Sydney's aircraft noise problems and Sydney's airport needs in the long term into chaos and also add another huge financial burden and an unnecessary burden in respect of those additional residences which would once again be affected by aircraft noise from the east-west runway if it was to be reopened.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer referred to my comments regarding the Labor electorates. This is another distortion, as the opposition is wont to do. Firstly, you distort the evidence with regard to safety. You and other spokespersons such as the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) have constantly said that we have said that reopening the east-west runway is unsafe. It has never been said that it is unsafe. It has been said that it is inherently safer to continue with the current operation and it would be a reduction in safety. But that does not seem to matter. Apparently, truth goes out the window when it comes to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I was making and I will make again is that in respect of the arguments put about so-called political decision making and the so-called political expediency that you have alleged, it is a funny sort of political expediency to be producing the result where the electorates that continue to receive aircraft noise happen to be Labor electorates. We cannot avoid that. If we all had our way, none of the people living in those electorates of Sydney would have to suffer this problem, but unfortunately some do. It just so happens that it has generally been Labor electorates that have suffered from it. That continues to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue to work to try to address those problems, not because they are Labor electorates but because they are citizens of Sydney who are entitled to live in some peace and quiet. It is really hypocritical to hear those comments from the opposition, particularly from spokespersons who have never experienced aircraft noise and never had to live in the areas or electorates of St George, Kogarah, Marrickville, Lowe or Grayndler to be coming in here and lecturing us about sharing the load when they can return to the comfort of their electorates up in Palm Beach and not worry about aircraft noise. They can just travel back down to the airport, jump on a plane, fly around the country and annoy a lot of other people. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Forshaw intervenes on the stub. I am not proposing the operation. This government determined the operation at Sydney airport, not the Civil Aviation Authority. If you look at the recommendations of the people who said, `Why don't you have three runways to give you that flexibility?' you are talking about domestic pilots; international pilots; flight transportation; those advisers to the FAC; Bill Pollard, the CEO designate for Air Services until he was nobbled; the regional airlines; and, of course, pilots who have come and spoken to us privately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I thought it was important that I respond to those particular issues. If Senator Collins is correct in what he says, what is he worried about? Why don't the authorities get that opportunity to have three active runways to address three problems that are competing with one another?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comments made were in regard to the bidding process. There is no doubt that the prospective bidders for the various airports are still carrying on with their due diligence. There are arguments about it and there are comments made by certain financial institutions that the program set by the government is too short. It does not matter what happens with this particular bill because the investigatory process by those interested in buying those airports will go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins also said that if Sydney airport, KSA, was extracted from this bill until the government was prepared to address the problems which it created, it would cause delay at other places. That is not correct. He also said that, if a buyer purchased one of the airports which is not one of the pairs, it may affect their ability to `be able to bid for either Sydney-Melbourne or Sydney-Brisbane'. That is not correct because the airports that are not included with the pairs are Perth and Adelaide. I thought I would make those points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins also had a cheap shot at Mr Howard.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, that is exactly the point I am making. You are the people who have been running the air traffic control. What we are proposing is giving the experts in the field the ability to be able to determine the best way of operating an airport with expert advice. You have not done that. You have restricted them. You have cut three active runways back to 1 7/8. No wonder there is a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to quickly touch again on Adelaide airport, because I think Senator Bourne came in at the latter stage of this. The reason we included Adelaide airport is that that is what the South Australians wanted. They felt that over the years they have been neglected somewhat and that, if they could have an extension to the runway at Adelaide, it would improve their tourism and trade potential because the runway could be lengthened to the extent where it could take long-haul aircraft. So we are simply responding to what was a request from the South Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adelaide airport is not one of the pairs, so it could be sold independently. There are ways of funding that extension. The government apparently promised the Minister for Transport in South Australia, Ms Laidlaw, that the extension would be provided in the 1996-97 budget. It has subsequently come back and said that, if we delay the sale of Sydney, that will not happen. It is hard to see what the correlation is, but there are other ways of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my earlier address, if the taxpayer pays for the extension, the price of Adelaide will go up; if the taxpayer does not&mdash;in other words, if we say to the prospective buyer, `If you want to buy this, you have got to extend the airport,'&mdash;obviously there will be a reduction in the price. But it really does not make a lot of difference. There are numerous permutations and combinations that can be used when buying these facilities. In view of the fact that a senator raised that issue, I thought I would outline the reason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, there are lots of ways of killing a bill, and one of them is to vote it down in the Senate. If it is voted down in the Senate, it cannot immediately come back in the same wording. Therefore, I guess we might all be working in various ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that, if we support a wording that will be problematical in the future, it will continue to be problematical. Also, we do not necessarily know that if it bounces back the various parties&mdash;perhaps the opposition&mdash;will stick to the position they are in now. If the bill, as the opposition has suggested, gets killed now on the spot as a result of not being supportable in its current form, that really means that within three months nothing can be immediately done that will be problematical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we can get down and work out how it would work&mdash;if it ever was to work. Then the communities who might, by regulation, suddenly find themselves with something for which there is no democratic process to resist might be very grateful. Probably the best course of action is to make judgments on the merits of amendments and on safety and other factors and vote the bill down on this occasion. Therefore, we would all have, I would think, what we are working for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask a question of the minister, if I could. In the second reading speech, and Senator Bourne referred to this, the government said quite categorically&mdash;it was said by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in the other place and by the minister who introduced the Airports Bill here&mdash;that the Commonwealth has undertaken extensive consultation with a range of interested parties, including states, territories and local government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that on this matter there was correspondence directly to the local government associations in each state. This mayoral council, which of course I am familiar with, apparently objected that they were not contacted directly. They are of course simply an association. I will not venture to test my memory on the background of the establishment of this group, but they were a collection of councils that were associated with airports. That was considered to be a sufficient reason for setting up a separate organisation from local government.</PARA></TALK.START>

So local government was in fact contacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I do not see much point in wasting any more of the time of this chamber on this utterly cynical exercise. I thank Senator Bourne for her confirmation of the success of these, I have to say, very stock standard and easily recognisable Senate tactics with the minor parties. I have seen it done in here a hundred times over the last seven years and certainly recognise it when I see it. It might be fooling some people&mdash;and Senator Parer knows this&mdash;but it is not fooling any of the institutions that have a serious intent to do some serious investment in some serious airports around Australia. They know that the opposition are acting like a bunch of anarchists, and they are, and are a very irresponsible bunch indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne did not need to confirm what she has just confirmed for me, but I thank her for doing so in any case. This is a transparent strategy to allow the opposition to get up and pay lip-service to and mouth off about their philosophical commitment to selling airports. Senator Parer knows full well there is no logical connection whatsoever between the leasing of any airport in Australia and the use of particular runways of any of those airports in Australia. The two things are absolutely unconnected. This is a piece of illogical, anarchistic nonsense that is simply designed to kill the Airports Bill by getting the support of the minor parties here, who in fact oppose the coalition's philosophy of selling these airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition want to cause, by using this chamber, maximum havoc for the government of this country, for the budget and for the budget process by wringing their hands and saying, `Oh, isn't it terrible. We actually do support leasing these airports, but we just had to link in the use of the east-west runway at Sydney airport as being conditional on it.' No-one is fooled by that, Senator Parer. You might be able to say it with a straight face, but that is because you have a hide six inches thick and you have been here a long time. Senator Bourne is not fooled by it; neither is Senator Margetts or anyone here in this chamber. Everybody knows that it is a cynical exercise which is designed to get the support of the minor parties in here for killing this bill and for in fact completely torpedoing the leasing of these airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this has not been lost&mdash;not that we would think it would be&mdash;in the investment community in Australia, who recognise these tactics for precisely what they are: absolutely designed to kill the bill and an attempt to destroy the government's budget strategy by getting support. As Senator Bourne says, we know what you are doing, but it suits their end to support the amendment to kill off this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not inflict any more of this duplicitous nonsense on the Senate that you are supporting the sale. You have linked the sale to this completely illogical matter of the use of a runway at an airport in order to get the minor parties' support for killing this legislation in the Senate and sending it back. This decision is consistent with everything else the opposition is doing. </PARA>

This cynical exercise is more along the same lines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating two bills cognately: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995. Originally these bills were to be debated separately. However, given the time now available for debate in this place, it is necessary to take these bills together and, in so doing, assist the government out of its legislative logjam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I was intending to make extensive comments on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), I now find it necessary to limit my remarks. To this end I simply note that the bill has eight major features, none of which is likely to ignite the imagination of the broad community. The revenue implications of the individual items in this bill are not large. Notwithstanding the significance of these measures for the government's taxation system, many of these measures are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As time is limited today, I would like to highlight just one of these measures. The government's moves to reduce the PAYE early remitter threshold from $5 million to $1 million in annual remittances is anticipated to increase the government's revenue this year, and this year alone, by some $275 million. As a result of this amendment, group employers who have annual PAYE remittances in excess of $1 million per year will be required to remit instalment deductions in the first 14 days of the month to the Commissioner of Taxation by the 21st day of the month. Deductions made in the balance of the month must be paid for by the seventh day of the following month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, employers with annual remittances below $5 million remit tax instalments for a month in a single payment on the seventh day of the following month. This change will take effect in respect of instalments deducted on or after 1 December 1995. For employers whose PAYE remittances are between $5 million and $1 million per annum there will be an additional cost in complying with these changes, as they will need to adjust their operations to take account of the fact that they will now be early remitters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the additional cost will probably be absorbed by all employers and will be a one-off cost. Nevertheless, it is worth asking: why has the government introduced this measure if it will merely increase compliance costs, will have no more than a one-year effect and only brings forward revenue which the government will otherwise gain in the course of time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the answer to the question lies in the priorities of the Labor government. At a time when Australia has over 700,000 of its people on the unemployment queues, why does the government increase costs for the businesses which must ultimately provide many of these people with work? Sadly, it is because this Labor government has introduced this petty measure for the sole and wholly unsatisfactory reason that it has failed the test of economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It wanted in May of this year to have the Australian people believe that it could construct a budget surplus. This measure is solely about cooking the books. Sadly for the government and for Australia, the Labor Party's failure to run this country's affairs has been long recognised. For within hours of the budget in May, the truth of that budget was revealed. The truth of the budget balance was obvious: there was no surplus, as generally understood. The budget balance was constructed without foundation and was premised on faulty fiscal materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the surplus has long ago evaporated, now might be a reasonable time for the government to admit that this specific measure is for balance sheet purposes only, concede it will have no net economic benefit to our nation and withdraw the provision. I recognise that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Sherry), who is at the table, does not have the authority to act on this measure today. However, I ask him to explain to the Australian people, in his response to this debate, how this measure will improve economic efficiency, how it might increase employment, how it will create the environment for a sustained reduction in interest rates, or how it will improve our taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that the measure is already set in concrete and that, in this government, once the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made his mind up, Labor's mind is made up. The coalition will not oppose the measure, as it relates to the administration of the taxation system and not to the principles underlying it. It is, however, a measure of madness and a measure of this government's madness. As I stated earlier, I do not intend to concentrate on this bill at length. The coalition will not oppose the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995. This is a very important bill for this parliament, as it represents one of the few times that this Labor government has actually admitted that it could get things wrong. The bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act in order to implement the results of a review of FBT compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation compliance costs refer to those costs which a taxpayer encounters in complying with the law&mdash;the law as created by this government and enacted in this parliament. Compliance costs in our taxation system make the system less efficient. Some may say they make the system positively defective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compliance costs for taxpayers was a matter addressed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts during its inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office between 1991 and 1993. The committee's report No. 326 summarises the issue neatly and I would like to quote from it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, it has not been a requirement that the cost of compliance be calculated or estimated prior to a legislative change being enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the law has been adjusted on a piecemeal basis, compliance costs have not been viewed as a necessary concern for the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the extent that the Commonwealth does not pay tax, compliance costs have not been a major consideration in making legislative change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, compliance costs do affect the capacity of business to function profitably.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the greater the cost of compliance the greater the incentive for taxpayers not to comply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compliance costs can therefore be considered to include the additional costs arising from obscure, complex or uncertain laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is difficult to calculate the cost of complying to any given law for any given taxpayer, it is reasonable to consider compliance costs as a factor in the efficiency of an economy&mdash;though not necessarily one which is of itself critical.</PARA>
<PARA>I thoroughly support these comments. It was because of concern that the costs of the FBT system had become both administratively defective and economically destructive that the government instigated a review of its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the inception of the system, the government has been warned that there would be significant costs in administering the FBT legislation. The government was told that the costs of the system would substantially reduce its economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was demonstrated to the government that while FBT was, in the language of taxation economics, equitable, it was also administratively complex and therefore costly to administer and operate. Nevertheless, this government has relied upon the FBT because of its heavy reliance on revenue to fund its extravagant expenditure priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review of FBT compliance costs was long overdue. Nevertheless, the commitment of this government to reducing compliance costs can only be judged by what it has included in this legislation. On that score, we look to the words of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) during his announcement of the results of the costs review in February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In releasing the review's finding, the Treasurer announced that the government would increase the rate of tax payable on car fringe benefits. The end result in this instance is quite remarkable. At the end of the day, when this legislation is passed, it will result in the government actually raising more revenue from the FBT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the Labor Party has recognised that the costs of complying with the FBT legislation are too great. But instead of finding fundamental ways of reducing compliance costs, it has restructured the system in a manner that maintains its revenue base. The government's priorities in this legislation are clear. The government is saying to the Australian people: `Yes, the law is too complicated; yes, the law imposes too great a cost on individuals and businesses; yes, we will restructure some components of the law. But, no, we will not, cannot and shall not alter the taxation system if it means less revenue for government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians should understand now, more clearly than ever, that the Labor Party views the taxation system merely as the means by which revenue is raised for expenditure by government. When the Labor Party talks tax, it is talking about how to take more money from people's pockets. It is not talking about what is right or equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the point of the compliance costs review if the outcome was to raise more revenue from taxpayers? Several representatives of the business and professional communities have expressed their opinion on this matter. Mr Bob Jeffery, the National President of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the so-called review of FBT has turned out to be just a thinly veiled exercise to appease genuine business concerns while still slugging business to raise the same amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA>The Executive Director of the Corporate Tax Association, Mr Bob Bryant, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Treasurer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">handed down in our view was not a serious attempt to come to grips with the inadequacies of the FBT regime. He has really let us down.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition agrees with these views. We believe this legislation is fundamentally flawed in principle and is therefore of dubious value. After so much effort and so much discussion, the fact that there is so much dissatisfaction with this legislation leads to the conclusion that the government really has little, if any, interest in reforming the law to reduce the costs of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn briefly to a number of the substantive measures of this bill. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the FBT Assessment Act in respect of meal entertainment. These amendments highlight the bureaucracy of the FBT system. The methods are a 50-50 split and a 12-week register. Many employers who adopt the 50-50 split method may actually pay more FBT than if they were to base their calculations on actual expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Economics Legislation Committee heard evidence on this proposed amendment. While the coalition recognises the arguments that have been made in respect of the efficacy of the amendments, it is inclined to support this change. Nevertheless, as the minority report of the committee makes clear, it would be preferable either to have a three-way split rather than the proposed 50-50 split or to return to the original non-deductible, non-FBT regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 of the bill was to have introduced some certainty in relation to living away from home allowances. I understand that the government has now proposed to drop these reforms. While the coalition welcomes the government's belated decision&mdash;almost a near death conversion&mdash;it is appropriate to recognise just what this government was proposing to do and what we could reasonably expect it to do were it to be returned at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had intended that an allowance would be a living away from home allowance fringe benefit only where the total period for which the employee had lived, or was required to live, away from his or her home was less than 12 months, where Australian residents were posted within Australia, or two years if the employee were posted to a remote location. The maximum residence period for employees working in Australia on temporary work permits and Australian residents posted overseas was four years. These changes would have been discriminatory and would have increased compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was the subject of significant investigation by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and it was thoroughly analysed and criticised in the minority report of that committee. The government has since had time to reflect upon the wisdom and astuteness of the views contained in that committee's minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much as I welcome the government's decision to omit schedule 2, I commend and congratulate the members who put their signatures to the minority report. In particular, I believe that the strength and wisdom of the words penned by my colleague Senator Watson should further enhance his standing in this place as a practical scholar of taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will support the government's amendment. I note, however, that the explanatory memorandum does not explain why, after so arrogantly and persistently defending the changes, the government has made this move. I look forward to the minister's explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 of the bill deals with the FBT on car parking benefits. Under these amendments, FBT will no longer apply to car parking benefits unless a commercial station within a one-kilometre radius of employer provided car parking facilities charges at least $5 per day on the first day of the FBT year. The $5 threshold, without indexation, may result in the exemption for car parking in regional centres being short-lived. Accordingly, while the coalition will be supporting this measure, it will be moving an amendment to index the $5 figure in line with CPI rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill, employers are given two ways to calculate the total taxable value of car parking benefits provided in a year. Under the first of these, the statutory formula method, the taxable value for each space is calculated by multiplying a statutory number of days&mdash;240&mdash;by the daily rate. Unfortunately, in setting the statutory number of days at 240, the government has ignored public holidays. The coalition will be moving an amendment to reduce the statutory number of days to 228 to take account of 12 national public holidays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government may claim that it is inappropriate to take holidays into account because the car park may be used by a third party, another employee, on these days. However, all the coalition amendment seeks to do is remove national public holidays from the calculation. It assumes that on these days no worker will use the car park. I look forward to hearing the minister's response on this matter in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also finally restores some sense to the FBT rules by excluding a number of items that should never have had the FBT applied to them as they do not have the characteristic of a fringe benefit. Unfortunately, a number of items are not included in the list of exempt items. Why this should be so is not clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final measure I wish to touch on today relates to taxi travel provided to employees for travel directly between work and home between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. and taxi travel provided for sick or injured employees to travel from work to their usual place of residence. There is a great deal of merit in these proposals. However, the limits the government has placed on the exemption just do not reflect reality. The coalition will be moving an amendment to modify the hours of exemption, such that they will be between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. These hours not only reflect commercial reality but also reflect more closely the hours of daylight in the majority of Australia for most of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition believes that there remains an urgent need to review the fundamentals of the FBT legislation to ensure that the policy works in practice. We accept the economic justification for the tax. However, its value depends critically on how it is administered, and presently it is not, in its totality, administered efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is committed to reform of the FBT. I cannot bring myself to honestly say to the Australian people that what we have here today is reform. It is a move in the right direction, but it is not reform. Only a coalition government will act to reform the FBT legislation. Only the coalition can and will provide a taxation system that is equitable, just and efficient to administer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats think the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995 is the damp squib of finality&mdash;the end of a process which started with a promise to make the incomprehensible FBT system more user friendly. It is true that the review of compliance cost was announced in the 1994 budget. Almost immediately though, I think the review went off the rails because the government announced that the outcome had to be revenue neutral.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This overriding policy objective meant that it would be almost impossible to reverse the trend of the fringe benefits tax encroaching more and more onto items which it should never have been applied to. It is an interesting strategy from the government, but it is one that they have adopted and are sticking to. The strategy basically is, `We don't want to have any discussion about how to broaden the revenue base. We don't want to talk about the fairest ways of raising revenue. What we will do is just apply existing taxes and test them against every nook and cranny we can find.' I suppose that, electorally, that is a bit more palatable, because the government can say, `This isn't a new tax. This is an existing tax, and we are just widening its application.' I understand the politics of that, but it really has led to some ludicrous situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me restate for the record that, when we had the first fringe benefits tax debates in this place&mdash;and they were very divisive&mdash;the Democrats supported them. We still do. The existence of the fringe benefits tax legislation has had the effect of closing a whole string of loopholes. It has been a very effective revenue collector, adding this year in gross terms about $2.8 billion to the revenue. The opposition is on the record now as saying that they are not going to go backwards and get rid of the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax creates massive compliance costs for business. I know the government is aware of that and that this is its response. However, a study by the Australian Tax Research Foundation has found that the smaller the business the more onerous the FBT liability. We are a bit disappointed to have to say that this final result which we are debating at the moment does not go far enough in our view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the package provides for more use of statutory formulas, the restrictions on using these formulas remain quite high. The Democrats think more use could be made of statutory formulas and statutory amounts to reduce compliance costs. Several businesses over the past year have told us&mdash;although I guess when it comes to the test they might change their mind&mdash;that they would be prepared to pay more fringe benefits tax if compliance costs were dramatically reduced. I think we should be about providing more options to business. Surely it is not just a lack of imagination on the part of the government and the tax office that is precluding reforms in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the application of an existing tax to every existing nook and cranny has led to the income tax system being stretched to the absolute extreme of crackdowns on small taxpayers so that two-thirds of people audited on their returns have been found to have made mistakes. We have had fringe benefits tax extended to inappropriate things such as employee share plans, late night taxis and mobile phones. We had the really absurd situation of four people sitting down to a business lunch being subject to four different tax formulas. This has led to confusion and I suppose a certain amount of frustration and anger across the business community, as more attempts have been made to eke out every possible dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, this legislation contains a few welcome reforms. It is made cost neutral by the $121 million in extra taxes on motor vehicles&mdash;still the biggest single contributor to fringe benefits tax collections. The bill will exempt from fringe benefits tax a range of products primarily used for business. This is a good thing. It includes protective clothing, calculators, tools of trade, computers and mobile phones. The bill exempts late night taxi travel. It reduces the number of declarations required to be made by employers&mdash;although we think this concession might yet prove to be of dubious value. The key changes are to entertainment and car parking expenses. On entertainment, the bill provides a further two options for determining the taxable benefit: a statutory 50 cent of cost method and a 12-week register method. On car parking, fringe benefits tax will be restricted  to employers within one kilometre of commercial parking stations charging $5 or more. This avoids the ludicrous situation of parking metres resulting in fringe benefits tax liabilities for nearby employers. It is good to see that the bill will give employers several options on how to calculate their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also proposes to change the taxation of living away from home allowances. It has emerged in evidence to the Senate committee that the result of these changes would be to increase revenue and compliance costs rather than reduce them. I am glad that the government has since dropped those provisions from this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. As others have said, it contains mostly uncontroversial provisions. The key provisions include changes to the taxation of the income of controlled foreign companies; changes to dividend franking rules to exclude from franking dividend debited to share capital or share premium accounts; an increase in the deduction on infrastructure borrowings from 33c to 36c; and a reduction in the threshold for early remittance of PAYE taxes from $5 million to $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us focus on the infrastructure concession for a moment. The infrastructure borrowings concession will cost over $200 million a year by 1997-98. I think the jury is still out on whether this tax concession is needed or whether the targeting of this tax concession is proper. It sounds like a good idea, but I think we should look at its immediate effect. I see that it has dramatically increased the profitability and attractiveness of tollways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Suddenly consortiums are falling all over themselves across the country to get on to the tollways gravy train. The recent Citylink agreement between the Victorian government and Transurban, underpinned by this concession, is probably the worst example. Under the contractual agreements with the builder-operator, Transurban, residents, businesses and local authorities will be restricted in their ability to claim compensation for road closures, land acquisition or the obstruction of the Yarra River. State planning laws will not apply and rights to appeal and protest yet again are restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this is a state government responsibility, but the fact is the federal tax regime is encouraging this. We ought to take a look at that. Victoria will be able to amend any suburban planning scheme to facilitate Citylink. Local authorities will be left watching on the sidelines. What is more, major thoroughfares will be closed and clearways removed from a number of major roads. Despite Premier Kennett's assertions to the contrary, this will effectively leave many residents with little choice but to use the tollway. As the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> said in its editorial last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Victorians will draw the conclusion that these measures have been taken because the State Government had to make certain that Transurban was assured of a profit before it would undertake the risk.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an astonishing deal from so many angles: the environment, public transport, local democracy, freedom of speech, urban planning, community consultation and so on. I would like to sound a warning. I think we find ourselves being asked to get used to it. Direct deals with private sector developers which override planning laws, which ignore communities and which aim to maximise private returns are unfortunately likely to be an increasing component of urban development in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just because of this. It is thanks to competition policy, but also thanks to the tax concessions on infrastructure borrowings. I can understand why it might have seemed like a great idea in theory, but I wonder if you made allowances for state premiers like Premier Kennett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The final aspect of this bill I want to address is the reduction in the threshold on early remittance on PAYE tax from $5 million to $1 million. The effect of this amendment is to force thousands of small and medium sized businesses to remit PAYE tax instalments to the tax office fortnightly rather than annually, increasing compliance costs and creating unexpected cash flow problems. The measure, though, will bring forward $275 million from 1996-97 to 1995-96. Quite a clever little measure! It was a major budget measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have to say the Democrats are extremely reluctant to support this measure because it does represent yet another tax impost on small business. It is being done in the absence of the wider context of urgently needed reform to small business taxation. Really, I am getting sick and tired of being asked to vote for legislation in here before the government bothers to respond to wide ranging inquiries which would mean that we might put in place some kind of cohesive response rather than bits and pieces as we go along. It is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end we are being asked to do this before the government has agreed to reduce the uplift factor on provisional tax. In hearings before the Senate Economics Committee, the tax office tabled documents showing that the result of the excessively high uplift factor is that each year small business is forced to pay about $300 million more in provisional tax than it should, tax on income it never earned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate inquiry into small business taxation, which Senator Gibson has referred to and which I moved to set up after the 1994 budget, did report in June. It is a good report. It recommends reform of provisional tax, a reduction in the uplift factor and a wide range of other recommendations designed to reduce small business tax compliance costs. But the government has not yet responded to that report. It should have. It should have responded by the end of September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have preferred to see the measure in this bill considered in the context of an overall review of small business taxation which looked at the incidence of tax being collected before the income is earned and looked at the incidence of compliance costs. It would make sense in terms of cohesive, coherent policy. But the government has refused to do this, and the government wonders why the small business community wonder whether it is committed to giving them a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to give some priority to responding to and endorsing the sensible and moderate proposals of the Senate committee, which have widespread support among the small business community and professions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support my colleague Senator Gibson in offering some comments on the two bills being debated cognately: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995. Senator Gibson has foreshadowed in some detail the concerns we have with the legislation and the amendments that we as a coalition will be moving to the bills. I will not go into those in any detail. They will be dealt with in considerable detail in the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) was introduced into the House of Representatives on 29 June of this year. It is an omnibus bill. It has a wide range of amendments to the taxation laws. It includes four measures that were announced in the 1995-96 budget relating to rebateable and frankable dividends, to infrastructure borrowings, to the reduction of the PAYE early remitter threshold and to the issue of depreciation on trading ships. It also deals with changes to the superannuation arrangements that were announced by the government on 28 June. It also encompasses changes to give effect to the announcement made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 26 February of this year of the government's initiative and intention to strengthen and extend the provisions of the law that deny deductions for losses where debts are released under bankruptcy law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill, was introduced a day earlier, on 28 June 1995. It implements the results of the government's review of FBT compliance costs that was announced by the Treasurer on 24 February 1995. That review, which culminated in that report of February 1995, was announced in the May 1994 budget. At that time the government anticipated announcing the results just a couple of months later, in July 1994. But the results were not announced until some seven months later, as I said, in February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that highlights the complexity of the fringe benefits tax as it has grown like Topsy under this government. It also highlights the inevitable consequential resultant very high compliance costs that are imposed on persons, particularly in the small business sector. I share the concern of my colleague Senator Gibson about the great cost that fringe benefits tax impacts upon small business, given the complexity that it covers today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think small business has been very harshly treated under the fringe benefits tax because of the growth of the tax and the complexity that is involved. If you ask many small businesses about it, they will tell you that the actual cost of complying with the law is costing them more than the government is raising in revenue. If you have a situation where that is the case, particularly if it is widespread, as it appears to be, then I think you have some very severe problems with the legislation as drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax in its original intention was very understandable and accepted because it was part of the necessity of bringing additional equity into the tax laws. But I do think the application of the tax and the growth of the tax&mdash;tentacles out everywhere&mdash;since then has moved the many parts of the FBT well away from that original understandable and acceptable intention. As a result of that, you have great uncertainty and great cost involved in the compliance with it. One of the commitments of an incoming coalition government is to take the necessary measures to reduce the inordinate compliance costs of FBT, particularly so far as small business is concerned, wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that concerns me about the bills in a general sense is the fact that we are debating them in the second last week of what is a quite frantic session. We have a situation where the government has absolutely lost control of its legislative program. We still have something like not far short of 100 bills, when you add them all up, to deal with in the remaining few days of this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills we are considering were introduced first into the House of Representatives at the end of June of this year. Some of the elements that they relate to were announced by the government much earlier than that. It is just really another indictment of the government's inability, for whatever reasons, to conduct its legislative program and to program that through the parliament in appropriate and proper due process ways, which is causing a huge backlog here and means that legislation cannot be considered as carefully as it should. It is legislation that affects every taxpayer in Australia in one way or another. It is an indictment of the government that we are being forced to consider not just this legislation but&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we have a problem with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. That is certainly so, Senator O'Chee, but I think the problems are more deep-rooted than that. I think the real problem is a basic incompetence on the part of the government in terms of managing its legislative program through its own necessary processes, and that culminates in the problems that we have got here. But, of course, the management of the business here is also a compounding factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general problem we have in the area of taxation&mdash;and these bills reflect part of it&mdash;is the huge and inexorable increase in taxation that goes on year in year out under Labor governments. We really ought to be concerned about not just the complexity of the legislation that we are looking at&mdash;and that complexity refers to much more than just the fringe benefits tax, to which I have referred. We now have two bills before the house which add pages and pages and pages to the mountain of taxation legislation of this country, which is virtually impossible even for the most exemplary practitioner to come to grips with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in the taxation laws since this government came to power 12 years ago, almost 13 long hard years ago, is almost inconceivable. It is no wonder that all in the community are labouring, particularly business and especially small business, under the great burden of compliance with government dictate&mdash;not only taxation and other laws, but also the whole plethora of regulations and other items of government action that really are a very deadening hand on what ought to be a much more vital growth-oriented economy than the one we have. And it is because of the approach of this government that we do not have that improved economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overriding all of that, as I say, are the inexorable increases we have seen in total government revenue. Of course, those increases have arisen because of the government's seemingly insatiable demand for more and more spending. The government has an appetite for spending which it seems incapable of satisfying. If you are going to increase government spending continually, inevitably you will have to increase the burden on taxpayers to meet the costs associated with that expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the great increases in taxation that we have seen occurring have not been sufficient to meet the government's spending appetite resulting from which we have had enormous budget deficits for many years. Of course, those budget deficits have added to the national debt which, in turn, has caused a major run-down in the national savings. It was said that this year we would have a budget surplus&mdash;it was announced in the budget&mdash;of about $700 million. That, of course, was after massive sales&mdash;</PARA>

Anyway, that is what he says he is going to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the inevitable consequence of what you have done as a government, in terms of your inability to control your own spending, has been to force taxes up every year in a way that is a great burden to the economy, to every individual and, particularly, to every family in Australia, but more particularly lower and middle income families. As a result of that, you have, as I say, blown out the foreign debt to levels that would have been absolutely unbelievable as recently as 10 years ago, let alone when you first came to power in 1983. At that time the total foreign debt was $23 billion; it is now at about $180 billion, eight times higher than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of all of those things, you have pushed interest rates to amongst those which are at the highest in the whole of the industrialised world. You have imposed burdens on business, on the private sector, on the ability for Australians to be competitive and productive in the way we all know that not only do they want to be but also they need to be if we are even to be able to maintain, let alone increase, our living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the living standards of many Australians have declined in real terms since this government came to office. That applies particularly and most sadly to those who are more in need in our community, particularly the lower income families and those families with children who are trying to get by on a single income. You have imposed the cruelest hardship on those families, I think, of any government in Australia's history. </PARA>

Perhaps, Senator Crowley, you might be good enough to tell the Senate what your taxation policy is and precisely which taxes you will increase.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately two bills&mdash;the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill 1995 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. Had these bills not been introduced so late into the parliamentary session, each of these pieces of legislation would have been dealt with separately. So there is pressure, as usual, towards the end of the year, and in such a pressure cooker environment there is always the problem of not properly attending to each of the specific items because they are substantial in themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking initially on the cost of compliance legislation and then on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), it is with a great deal of relief that the government, under overwhelming opposition from those affected, has withdrawn schedule 2 from the bill. Schedule 2 covered those most iniquitous living away from home allowance proposals. Fortunately, they are now out. This result is due to the proper use of the Senate committee system whereby certain legislation is referred to a review committee, which gives those affected by the legislation a great opportunity to present their views, under cross-examination, to the parliament. It is an important segment of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original proposal, we believe on this side of politics&mdash;and I am glad the government has now acceded to this particular view&mdash;was impractical because it set some very arbitrary limits and it really did not reflect commercial practice. There was also a greatly increased cost to employers, falling principally on contractors, who could have been up for an additional $50 million had those LIFA provisions not been amended, and also the mining industry. Furthermore, the original proposal would have caused general disharmony in industrial relations right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think today is an appropriate opportunity to acknowledge some of the very fine presentations that obviously persuaded the government to change its mind. I thank Senator Short and Senator Gibson for their comments. The title of the bill, I remind the Senate, includes the words `cost of compliance' because the cost of compliance weighs very heavily on all taxpayers across Australia not only for income tax but increasingly for fringe benefit tax. This is indeed a serious issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this increasing cost of compliance is something that this government is going to have to live with. It is fairly unique to Australia. While perhaps some other countries might be getting their costs of compliance down, ours is escalating at a most unacceptable rate. In addition to paying our tax, we are paying effectively a secondary tax in the form of having to devote all those resources just to comply with taxes. Fringe benefit is not a good example because in a number of areas, particularly in car parking, the costs of compliance for some firms actually exceed the taxes they pay to government. That is indeed a very bad tax. The government stands condemned on its track record in terms of increasing the cost of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I drew to the attention of the Senate a speech by Richard Buchanan, a distinguished former president of the Tax Institute of Australia. Throughout that address he frequently drew attention to the burden on taxpayers, particularly business, in having to comply with tax legislation, particularly the FBT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has actually sought a great deal of mileage from this particular piece of legislation, particularly from its decision to remove lap-top computers and mobile phones when those phones are used principally for business or employment and also certain after-hours taxi costs. But those concessions are offset by an increase in the statutory rate for calculating car benefits provided to employees. What are regarded as minor benefits have also been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I wish to make is that those concessions should never in the first place have been subject to the fringe benefit tax regime. This government set out to tax fringe benefits on remuneration packages, but it has grown to be a tax on a lot more than just remuneration packages. The other concessions include&mdash;and I give the government its due&mdash;portable computers, protective clothing required for employment, briefcases, calculators, tools of trade, subscriptions to trade and professional journals, airport lounge membership, business related software, electronic diaries and corporate card membership fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to give you some idea of the ludicrous extent to which the fringe benefit tax regime extended, when a boss provided sunscreens and sun hats to protect his employees working in the sun, he was required to pay fringe benefits tax on those sorts of expenditures. That was absolutely outrageous. It was not conducive to employers providing these sorts of things. That is what I mean by the ludicrous nature, unhealthy nature, of some of these fringe benefit applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of fringe benefits were so unreal and so un-Australian that the government eventually was forced to change its mind in relation to, say, protective clothing, taking that out as a fringe benefit. In other words, if a council provides a council worker with sunscreen and hats, no longer does the employer have to pay a fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note&mdash;and I think I should share this with the Senate&mdash;that the Tourism Council of Australia raised three significant issues in relation to fringe benefits: firstly, the income tax and the fringe benefit treatment of the benefits not between employer and employee but with third parties is increasingly complex. When a benefit is provided to an employee by a third party it really should be taken out of the fringe benefit tax regime, as a simple solution, and transferred to income tax so the person who gets the benefit from a third party pays income tax. That would certainly ease the fringe benefits tax on tourism greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Tourism Council mentioned having the normal accounting year, which is 1 July through to 30 June, as an option in addition to the already prescribed fringe benefits year, which, as you know, is different from the financial year because the fringe benefit year runs from 1 April through to 31 March. It should not be mandatory but optional. In such a case, it could have a great deal of merit for some firms in reducing compliance costs. I think it should be noted and picked up by the government. Thirdly, the time for lodgment of the fringe benefit tax return is just too tight given the range of benefits that are now subject to fringe benefit tax plus the sheer complexity of the legislation that ordinary businessmen, who are not necessarily accountants, have to adhere to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of criticism of where the fringe benefits tax is going, I draw on what Corporate Tax Australia's respected tax spokesman Bob Bryant said. He believes that there was a lost opportunity in the cost of compliance review that the government undertook. It resulted in the removal of those so-called minor fringe benefits from the fringe benefit tax regime. He believes that the government really did not tackle such issues as business entertainment. The government has failed to correct the underlying FBT policy which has increasingly strayed into the non-remunerative area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government made these minor concessions it sought to neutralise the effect of the loss. In effect it is going to collect a lot more money because it is going to increase the statutory rate for calculating car benefits provided to employees. The cost of providing those benefits, according to the Taxpayers Association, is on average 10 per cent and, in some cases, as high as 17 per cent. It is quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would be aware that nine years ago the government introduced the fringe benefits tax concept where the responsibility for payment fell not on the person who got the benefit but on the employer who provided the benefit or an association or third party that provided a benefit. We are really getting into an unreal situation. Nine years ago we had this significant change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was introduced with all the ulterior equity motives of improving tax equity. Since that time it has been revenue driven. It has become a major revenue earner estimated to yield over $3.23 billion in the current financial year. At the same time it is going to add hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit that the amendments before the Senate already add to the corporate problems associated with the provision of entertainment. The new provisions apply only to meal entertainment&mdash;that is, food and drink. This is going to add further to this compliance difficulty. You have to excise the cost of the drink and food from, for example, the taxi cost involved in getting to the place and also if there was any deemed recreation part of that function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposals, an employer may choose one of three methods where meal entertainment is provided: firstly, a ratio based on a 12-week record keeping log book style; secondly, a 50/50 split; or, thirdly, the actual expenditure. There is a real problem with the 50/50 split because the FBT is payable on all employees' meal entertainment regardless of whether it is deductible or non-deductible for income tax purposes. You have the ludicrous situation of a non-deductible item which you have to pay fringe benefits tax on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxpayers Association of Australia warns that  taxpayers should be very wary of these new rules as it is possible that they may result in high FBT costs if the wrong method is chosen. You are really forcing ordinary businessmen to go out and seek the best professional advice on choosing the most appropriate method of accounting for their fringe benefits tax&mdash;that is, choosing between option one, two or three. These sorts of criticisms should not be made in a clever society. These sorts of taxation systems are quite foreign for a clever society that is trying to get into international trade and make Australia more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a submission, charter accountants Coopers and Lybrand stated that the definition of `meal entertainment' provided in section 37AC will add to the cost of employers identifying what is really entertainment, whether the entertainment involves food and drink or some other entertainment activity and the costs, such as accommodation or travel, associated with food and drink entertainment. We know about all the variations that can apply when the employer provides it on the factory premises or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does nothing to overcome the existing problem employers face in identifying situations where meals and other types of entertainment have been provided to employees by associates or third parties under an `arrangement'. That is an expression broadly defined in the fringe benefits tax law. Ample evidence of the difficulty employers have in identifying meal entertainment under current fringe benefit law is contained in the recently released taxation draft ruling TR95/D13. In addition to the laws that are passed by this parliament, we also have to comply with these rulings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 50/50 split method of valuing meal entertainment ignores the fact that successful businesses spend more time and money entertaining clients rather than their employees. The proposed 50/50 split is so skewed in favour of revenue that it is unlikely to be used by the majority of taxpaying employers. There has not been enough thought put into this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot adequately deal with the whole of the legislation. In my remaining five minutes I will try to look at the whole of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3). There is a retrospective element in this bill which I believe is abhorrent. It relates to controlled foreign companies. People might say that they can look after themselves, but the fact is that we should not allow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment effects the accounting period ending 30 June 1995. All we really need to do is substitute that with the words `commencing 30 June 1995'. If it ends on 30 June 1995 it relates to the previous 12 months. What was good law in July, August, September or October is now made a penalty under this decision. I think that is quite reprehensible. Let us hope that we can pass through this place a simple amendment to replace `effecting the accounting period ending 30 June 1995' with `as from 30 June 1995'. I hope that this is an unintended consequence and will be fixed up very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that I wish to address relates to dividends passed between companies. The Income Tax Assessment Act generally allows a rebate equal to the amount of the dividend for the receiving company so that the dividends are taxed in the hands of the final recipient rather than at each step as they are passed through the various companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was announced in the 1995-96 year that the inter-corporate dividend would not apply when the dividend was paid out of a capital amount of the company rather than from profits. The philosophy was right but the wording was wrong. In a press release on 9 May 1995, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will put an end to tax avoidance schemes that rely on the characterisation of such distributions by a company as a rebatable dividend.</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of such an amendment is to prevent the transfer of franking credits from companies paying dividends out of unrealised and untaxed profits by means of directly or indirectly debiting these dividends to share capital, share premium accounts or revaluation reserves. It can also be used to take moneys from profits into the reserve and then out of the reserve back into profits. There are no elements in some of these transactions of using the reserve as a tax avoiding technique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again we say that by a simple amendment you could excise what is legitimate from that which is not legitimate. You will not transfer amounts out of profits into the reserves because of the tax implications. What about those that have already been used like this? You will not be able to get the moneys out under the legislation as it stands at the present time. I think the government tried to recognise this problem by a further amendment during the debate in the House of Representatives, but the amendment did not go far enough; it was much too narrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While transfers from revaluation reserves which are directly charged against the relevant asset account will be excluded transfers, transfers from the revaluation reserves to the profit and loss account, for the same reason and to the same effect, will not be excluded transfers. So we have a major problem. I believe that while the government has come up with a number of amendments, more are required to ensure that this legislation is a lot fairer than what some of the narrow definitions currently provide. I call upon the government to acknowledge these issues and agree to the amendments, and I hope that the minor parties will agree with us. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will first of all deal with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. The Greens have no real problem with this bill as written but, as this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act, it is an appropriate bill for an amendment of ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment is designed to guarantee, by explicit inclusion, that the application of lime to reduce soil acidity is fully deductible as a landcare expense. It should not be contentious since we are assured that it should now be covered under section 75D(1B)(c). I have a letter from the Assistant Commissioner of Taxation to that effect, and I have just asked for it to be circulated to the duty minister and to the opposition so that you can have a look at it. I will be seeking leave at the end of this speech to table a copy of this. I hope I can get a statement from the minister as to whether the inclusion of liming to reduce acidity as deductible under 75D is and was the intention of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of agricultural lime to fields has an important function in reducing the acidity of soil. Soil acidity is a major problem in Australia, particularly since the increased use of subclovers, which increase soil acidity. Around 35 million hectares are affected by acidification each year, and over 55 million hectares of moderately acidic soil are at risk of becoming highly acidic, with a pH of less than 4.8. At this level, plant growth and farm yield begin to decline dramatically. Reduced crop cover can contribute to erosion, further damaging soils. New South Wales already has 13.5 million hectares of highly acidic soil; Queensland, 8.4 million hectares; and WA, 4.7 million hectares of highly acidic soil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soils can be rehabilitated, although it becomes far more difficult and expensive once soils become really degraded. A major means of ameliorating acidification is through the application of agricultural lime, which is nothing other than crushed limestone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this amendment is that there appears to be some problem with the drafting of a booklet put out by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income tax deductions for landcare related activities</EMPHASIS>. The problem arises because section 51(1), which is the section which relates to soil improvement, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the application of gypsum, lime, fertiliser, etc to improve soils can be deducted (100%) under section 51(1) is dependent on the expenditure being classified as an operating expense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the application of gypsum or lime to improve soil structure may normally be deductible under section 51(1) if it is done on an annual basis. If it is done every five years it may not be deductible as this would generally be regarded as a capital expense.</PARA>
<PARA>This excludes the application of lime for amelioration of acid soils, since this use usually involves application of lime every five to 10 years. So, liming fields to combat acidity is a capital expense. But on page 4 of the same general guidelines, under the heading `Capital or operating expenditure', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital expenditures are money spent to produce or acquire a fixed, long-term or long-lasting asset. These are usually made on a `once and for all' basis. An example of capital expenditure is a shearing shed or tractor used to produce income from the land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Operating or recurring expenditures are made in the course of trade to produce business revenue. These are payments usually made on a regular basis. An example is the cost of fertiliser used to improve a crop or pasture.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a correct definition of capital expenditure, but the problem is that it appears to exclude such things as periodic five- to 10-year applications of lime to fields. Taken with a restriction under operating expenses, it seems to exclude liming for acidification completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office has this explanation. They were asked for piecemeal definitions by staff at Primary Industries and Energy. The result is a document that might be technically correct but is not complete and is highly misleading in relation to lime. The Assistant Commissioner of the ATO who worked on the booklet said that, from an ATO perspective, the application of lime for reducing acidity is a once and for all basis. It just is a once and for all cost that occurs over and over regularly. I think the ATO will have to fight this definition out with academic linguists, but the important thing is that they appear willing to have lime to reduce soil acidity included under 75D(1B)(c). </PARA>

<PARA>The Companies and Securities Advisory Committee provided considerable input into the new and simplified arrangements for company reporting. This matter has been recently debated in this chamber, and it will hopefully lead to an improvement in the capacity of the ASC to deal with proprietary company accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as would be evident to those people who have been listening to some notices of motion I have given in recent days, there still are many serious matters in this area of proprietary company reporting that, it seems to me, the Securities Commission itself has to address and I hope the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee addresses. For example, there is a matter which I intend to raise shortly&mdash;in fact, it is a matter I raised earlier today&mdash;involving the failure of one of the companies in the Keating-Constantinidis piggery group, at a time when Mr Keating was its half-owner, to adequately report what had been going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter in which the sale of Mr Keating's half-interest, which took place in March of last year, is still not recorded in the annual return of the major holding company. As I noted earlier today, the latest annual return for Euphron Pty Ltd was filed with the Australian Securities Commission by Mr Constantinidis, who was Mr Keating's business partner in this piggery. This report was filed in January of this year, which is 10 months after Mr Keating sold his half-ownership of this piggery group to Indonesian interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that this annual return for the year to 30 June 1994&mdash;in other words, three months after the sale&mdash;fails to record this transfer of ownership. Instead, it falsely reports that on 30 June 1994 the owners of Mr Keating's half-equity in the piggery were Mr Achilles Constantinidis and his family company, Sephrenia Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advise the Senate that Mr Achilles Constantinidis and his family company, Sephrenia, held on to Mr Keating's half ownership of that piggery for only 10 days. Yet 20 months after the event it is still shown on the official Australian Securities Commission records as being held by Sephrenia and Mr Constantinidis. The reason is simple: it means that anyone looking up those records would not be aware of the fact that Mr Keating had effectively disposed of his half-ownership in the piggery to Indonesian hands. I do not care what foreign country it was sold to. All that bothers me is that a device was used. This device was to interpose Mr Constantinidis and Sephrenia for 10 days so that Mr Keating's disposal to the Indonesians would not be seen as such and he would not have to be in an apparent conflict of interest in seeking FIRB approval from his own Treasurer for the sale of his ownership of the piggery going overseas. That is improper enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incredible that the ASC rules apparently allow&mdash;I say allow because no action has been taken&mdash;this kind of totally false report to continue to stand in the ASC records showing that a company that held this ownership for only 10 days in March was not recorded in the latest annual return as having disposed of it to an Indonesian company. If it is not illegal, the rules should be changed to ensure that it is made illegal. </PARA>

<PARA>I regret the fact that the time allotted for the consideration of all these documents is but five minutes. I would like to talk about some of the exciting things that are happening at the Anglo-Australian Observatory at Siding Spring Mountain. One of those that some people may be aware of from reports in the media is the commissioning of the two-degree field project, which is a special wide angle prime lens arrangement for the Anglo-Australian telescope. It will allow observers at the observatory to take very large field-of-view examinations of the sky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this two-degree field will be focused on finding new galaxies and accurately measuring the Doppler shift of those galaxies. That is very important because by measuring the Doppler shift it is possible to estimate the distance that galaxy is from us. Having estimated the distance and where it lies in line of site, it is possible for the observatory to construct a 3-D model of galaxies surrounding ours. That is very important because it will then allow astronomers after a period of time to form some conclusions as to the shape of the universe. That in itself is also very exciting. One of the things it will lead to is a re-examination of the age of the universe because we have the situation at the moment where if current observational examination of the universe is correct, there are stars that are older than the universe itself. Obviously, that is a highly improbable situation and it will require cosmologists to re-examine some of the views that they hold on the nature of the universe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total expenditure by the Commonwealth on the Anglo-Australian observatory is just a tad over $3 million. A similar amount is provided by the UK government. That is extremely good value for money. I draw the attention of honourable senators to some of the work which has been done by scientists at the observatory. For example, there has been some work done by the astronomers Chapman and Habing who have been doing investigation for hydroxyl maser emission in stars. Hydroxyl masers are basically stars that emit highly concentrated emissions of radiation along the 18 centimetre wavelength. That corresponds to the absorption line for hydroxyl radicals floating around in space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other work, for example, included the study of quasars behind nearby galaxies. Most interestingly, there has been work to discover a gravitational lens. It has been possible to find the effect of gravity bending light from a quasar so that the light is being bent so much that it is possible for the observer to see two images of the same quasar with exactly the same red shift, which indicates that it is the same object. The reason why we see two images of the same object is that the light is bent as it travels around an item of large mass in the intervening part of space. It is believed that this may be some large item of dark matter. In other words, there is an enormous dark object out there which has been in this light. It could be all sorts of things. It could be just a concentration of dark matter, which is not luminescent. There are other suggestions&mdash;for example, a black hole that lies along that way, which would be bending the light.

<PARA>I am interested to see that this is one of those occasions where the Senate, once again, has had to wait in breathless anticipation for quite some time before this report actually got to us. I note from the report itself that it was signed by Mr B.W. Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, on 21 September 1995. It is now before us on 21 November 1995. Obviously, the equal employment opportunity annual report was a promptly done report. I wonder why it has taken so long to get to us, particularly, according to the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, since it was supplied to the department and to the minister on 26 September 1995, just five days after Mr Fraser signed it off, yet it has not come here until today. We have sat for quite a few days. I am mentioning this because I mention it whenever there has been any slip-up like this in reports coming forward. I think the people who are delaying the presentation of these reports need to be reminded consistently that they have an obligation to provide the Senate with them as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should mention that the only point of substance that did strike me in this report was the disclaimer, in effect, on page 5 which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the past year, staff numbers throughout the Bank continued to decline as a result of natural attrition and a voluntary redundancy program to manage the exit of surplus staff.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose one can wonder why the Reserve Bank has suddenly discovered they have surplus staff. Greater efficiency, more automation and so on may be the reason. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes continue to complicate analysis of some of the underlying trends and make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of some EEO initiatives. Nevertheless, they have not deterred the continued active implication of the Bank's EEO program.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot remember from the bank's annual report the extent to which it plans further reductions in employment but obviously the bank, like various other instrumentalities, is playing its role in diminishing employment opportunities&mdash;just as Telstra is. We discovered last Friday at a Senate committee hearing that Telstra is also cutting back dramatically on its employment of particularly university graduates. It says it is not going to take them on unless there is some extraordinary pressure to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May be one of the reasons the government finds its employment policies faltering and unemployment rising again is that many of its own operations are employing fewer people&mdash;perhaps to the benefit of taxpayers but perhaps not to the benefit of the employment figures. Obviously, the opposition would not be seeking to discourage government instrumentalities from becoming more efficient, but the fact is that the government's much vaunted capacity to encourage the private sector to employ people has faltered, just as its own record as an employer is being diminished. Because of this government's economic policies, there are now simply no opportunities available to the many people who went into particularly the tertiary sector or stayed at school because they could not readily get jobs but who are now coming into the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I should also mention that a couple of other documents seem to have taken a fair while to get to us. The annual report from the Prices Surveillance Authority, dated 19 October 1995, has only just got to us. We have certainly had a week of sittings where it was possible that it could and should have come to us. The Civil Aviation Authority report on the equity and diversity program, dated 27  September, got to us only today. I think some of these bodies could smarten themselves up. </PARA>

<PARA>I want to address a few brief remarks to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission annual report for 1994-95, which was tabled today. This document was not available during the normal estimates process. This is a large document, with in excess of 300 pages in it. It is a very important document for those of us who follow matters under the jurisdiction of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This has occurred for the second year running. On both times in my brief period in this place that I have wanted to ask about the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission at Senate estimates hearings I have not been provided with their annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, last year we were given their annual report at the hearing with a stamp on it that it was only a draft and it was still subject to the minister's approval. So here we were supposedly trying to have accountability after being given the document on the morning of the hearing&mdash;clearly unacceptable. This year it was even worse. Only one draft copy was made available for the whole committee during the Senate estimates process. I sought an assurance from the staff at the table that it would not become a trifecta, that this would not happen three years in a row, because that sort of lack of accountability to the parliament is not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with some interest that Sir Ronald Wilson, the president, wrote to the Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, on 5 October 1995. I would have thought it was within the minister's capacity to have approved this and allowed it to be ready for the Senate estimates process by the time we held the hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, we have this Attorney-General continually beating his chest saying how committed he is to human rights and against all forms of discrimination, but one thing that he did do was discriminate against those of us in the parliament who would seek to have the opportunity to question and also ascertain how certain projects are going under the jurisdiction of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. If the Attorney-General is to be believed about his commitment to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the legislation that it operates under, and if there is to be accountability, the Attorney-General has a duty to make sure that these documents are tabled on a timely basis and provided to the parliament so that we can ask appropriate questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter I pursued on the last occasion that estimates hearings were held was the Filipino women's project. I now note that that has been given to the Institute of Criminology at Sydney University. The reason for that is that Philippines-born women are 5.6 times more likely to be killed by their husbands or partners than any other Australian woman. Of course, those sorts of statistics are alarming and it is appropriate for us to ascertain the reasons for that and then overcome that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which continues to concern me about the functioning of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is that the legislation under which it operates does not allow for the awarding of costs to those who are taken to the commission and have cases against them dismissed. A lot of small businesses are having to incur substantial legal costs to defend spurious claims and then be confronted with a legal bill after having won the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, many of these small businesses say to a complainant who is clearly vexatious and has no basis to make a complaint that they will give them $2,000 because they will have to pay that in legal bills anyway. The complainant accepts that, runs away and rubs his or her hands in glee. I think that really is a shortfall in the legislation which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ought to examine in some detail and come back to the government with recommendations so that commissioners do have the power in certain circumstances to award costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join Senator Abetz in expressing concern that the provisions that currently govern the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission do not allow the granting of legal expenses in cases where people have been taken to the commission and have subsequently won. It is a very basic principle of the legal system in this country that people should not be of a disadvantage when they are innocent. In just about any court of law it is normal occurrence that somebody who is a defendant in a case and is exonerated receives their costs. It is extraordinary that they would not receive their costs. I can think of a couple of situations where they might not, but it is generally extraordinary that they do not receive their costs&mdash;yet the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission legislation is such that that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is exactly what is happening. Senator Abetz was 100 per cent accurate when he said that it creates a situation where many small businesses are at the mercy of potentially vexatious litigants; and that people can threaten to sue and the small business in question knows it will have a $2,000 legal bill at the bare minimum if it attempts to defend itself and wins.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in the adjournment debate I want to discuss three areas of genuine concern to the people of Tasmania where they have been neglected or dealt a bitter blow by the Labor Party. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would know, and most Australians would know, that Tasmania is a small state which has a very good track record in relation to its agriculture, forestry and aquaculture industries. Unfortunately, all of these three large and growth areas for employment are being hit very savagely by the current federal Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer firstly to the aquaculture industry which is still reeling from the draft risk analysis prepared by AQIS and so vehemently supported by Senator Sherry, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The draft risk analysis has been dealt with on occasions in this place by me, Senator Calvert and others from Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three matters that I want to deal with tonight indicate how AQIS got it so very wrong in those three areas and clearly defy any explanation. Firstly, AQIS, in its draft risk analysis, said that there was no coincidence between the distribution of salmonid populations and human populations; that basically they were not very close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second largest producer in the industry is located at Margate, a township where I grew up. I know the place relatively well. Margate is a township on the outer fringes of Hobart, within one of the fastest growing municipalities in my home state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that AQIS did not even get that aspect of its report right is astonishing. That a Tasmanian Labor senator could go into bat on behalf of AQIS, not knowing the geography of his own state, as Senator Sherry did, is an abysmal failure by that parliamentary secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, AQIS's draft risk analysis said that fish processing plants likely to process salmon were located away from salmonid populations. Once again, that is absolutely and utterly wrong. Senator Bell is laughing. As a Tasmanian, he would know there are three fish processing plants within line of sight of the farms at Margate. That is the township I grew up in. I know the place extremely well. If AQIS had taken time, a physical examination would have told them that they are wrong, wrong, wrong on that count.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the question that, if they can get it so wrong on something that any person could do, how on earth are we to believe them in their scientific analysis? If they cannot do an on-ground search and reconnoitre the situation, how on earth can we believe them and give them any credibility on their other assessments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS, in their draft risk analysis, discounted the risks posed by rubbish disposal. Within Margate there is a municipal tip. It has been the recipient of fish waste, namely orange roughie waste, which became a matter of some public disquiet. With a factory at Margate, it is quite likely that remnants would find their way to the tip. Anybody who has visited the municipal tip at Margate would know there are a lot of seafaring birds, namely seagulls, that go between the sea water, where the fish farms are, and the tip. The likelihood of contamination from that source is very high. That AQIS could get it so wrong and that the parliamentary secretary could have gone in so hard on behalf of AQIS does defy explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of concern is that the Labor government is now saying that it is going to put off the decision, first, for three months, then for an extra six months and now even further to pass it by the next election, whenever that might be, so that it will not have to make a decision or announce publicly a decision which many Tasmanians fear has already been made. Of course, during all this period no sector of this industry is going to expand or create further employment, although the opportunities are there, because they could literally be dealt a death blow if the draft risk analysis were to be implemented, as was so strongly supported by the parliamentary secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aquiculture industry, both directly and indirectly, is responsible for about 2,000 employment opportunities within Tasmania, and in particular in some areas where there are very high unemployment levels. Another area where there are very high unemployment levels is the Huon Valley of Tasmania. The Huon valley is well known for its apple industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in recent times the federal government has announced another body blow to a burgeoning Tasmanian industry. Tasmania used to pride itself on its apple industry. It went through a considerable lull. But now in my home state over 50 per cent of apple trees are under the age of five years and have yet to come into bearing age. Even without further plantings, production is expected to exceed four million 20-kilo cartons by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apple industry is a major employer in the Tamar and Mersey valley in northern Tasmania and is recognised by the Tasmanian government as the largest employer of labour in the Huon region south of Hobart. I note that the Liberal candidate for Franklin, Mr Les Glover, is very much aware of that. That is why last Saturday he was at the Huon show with a petition asking for support to oppose the Labor government's newly announced cider tax on apple cider. This tax will deal a very real blow to another new and developing industry within my home state of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apple industry is vitally important, as shown by the statistics that I have just read out. The current farm gate value of the Tasmanian apple industry is around $60 million, with an estimated flow-on value of $97 million to the state. The cider tax was announced as a result of the inquiry into the wine industry, where long and detailed assessment was made as to whether or not a wine tax ought be introduced. The result of that was anti there should not be such a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did the federal government do? Without any consultation with the apple growers or with the cider industry and none of the courtesies extended to the wine industry, they simply made the decision that there would be a tax on cider. Why was there no consultation? Why were the people, especially in Tasmania, ignored by the Labor government? The basis of their decision defies all logic, because one would have thought that a fruit wine, be it from grapes or apples, ought be treated in the same manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly the Labor Party has read some of the polling and is of the view that a lot of the Tasmanian seats will fall anyway and they therefore might as well try to bolster the wine industry and some grape growing areas in South Australia and elsewhere and write off some Tasmanian seats. But that is not the way you ought to govern this country. The apple industry clearly deserves better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Liberal candidate for Franklin, Les Glover, on the initiative that he took last weekend and for the very real input that he has had into my party processes. I note that he issued a media release today indicating that the Liberal Party is opposed to new taxes and increasing taxes. Therefore I have every hope that, once the legislation is introduced by Labor and we see the fine print of it, it will be opposed not only as being a discriminatory tax but also as being one that could deal a very real blow to further employment opportunities, especially in my home state of Tasmania and in particular in the electorate of Franklin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week honourable senators will recall that I read to the Senate a statement by Mr Paul Berry of Moonah in Tasmania and indicated that I would provide further information with regard to an accusation that Mr Berry is making about the case of Sydney Sparkes Orr, a case which is notorious in the history of Tasmania. I continue Mr Berry's accusation with a verbatim reading of an accusation which he has published in the state of Tasmania and I bring it to the Senate tonight. I quote directly from a document provided to me by Mr Berry. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accusation</EMPHASIS>, and it reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I, Christopher Paul Berry, of 45 Sixth Avenue, Moonah West in Tasmania, do make Oath and say:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. THAT in the case of Sydney Sparkes Orr v. University of Tasmania, No. 278 of 1956, the said Professor Orr was denied justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. THAT he was denied justice by wilful and calculated disregard of certain evidence or of the import of such evidence, by the trial Judge in the Supreme Court of Tasmania, Mr. Justice (later Sir,) Richard Kenneth Green.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. THAT upon Professor Orr's Appeal, heard in the high Court of Australia in May of 1957, the Judges of the High Court hearing that Appeal, did likewise knowingly and deliberately disregard that same evidence or the import of that same evidence. They had, however, acknowledged that the issues were mainly not issues of law but of fact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. THAT by their refusal to follow normal processes of ratiocination, justice was thereby further and finally denied to Professor Orr, even at this, the highest level to which he had access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. THAT Professor Orr's original summary dismissal resulted from a process of so-called inquiry, but in which proper inquiry in a manner appropriate to a matter of such acknowledged gravity, was not pursued. In finding as he did, that neither the Kemp Committee inquiry nor the Vice-Chancellor's inquiry into the Milanov, Townsley and Tanner allegations was conducted according to the Statutes of the University, I claim support from Judge Green.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. THAT Professor Orr, in the Kemp Committee inquiry was denied natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. THAT the true purpose of this Inquiry would appear to have been, less the ascertaining of the truth than the contrived rationalisation of frame-up. This was under the guidance of Solicitor-General Stanley Burbury and the Chancellor of the University, Mr. H. S. (Later Sir Henry) Baker, M.L.C.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. THAT there would appear to have been conspiracy against Professor Orr.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. THAT Stanley Charles Burbury, (later to be made K.B.E., K.C.V.O. &amp; K.C.M.G.) who at the time of the Kemp Committee inquiry was Solicitor-General for Tasmania, would appear to have been involved in such conspiracy as alleged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. THAT the said Stanley Burbury could appear to have been involved in the furtherance of such conspiracy as alleged, by other criminal means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. THAT Reginald Kemp, Suzanne Kemp and Geoffrey Allison would appear to have been manipulated in the bringing forward of allegations against Professor Orr to the University inquiry; and that such manipulation would appear to have been by means akin to blackmail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. THAT similarly, they would appear to have been under duress in the giving of sworn evidence in the Supreme Court in support of the University defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. THAT Suzanne Kemp, both at the University inquiry and later in her sworn evidence, did endeavour to indicate that her purported allegations against Professor Orr did not in fact apply to Professor Orr at all. In this, I say, she was steadfastly ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. THAT the said Suzanne Kemp endeavoured to show, and to show in a manner which could not be controverted, that her evidence did in fact relate to a real person other than Professor Orr, and with whom, her sworn evidence suggested, she had some kind of relationship. I do not refer to Geoffrey Allison. In this too, she was apparently wilfully disbelieved, despite the judicial pretence that she was believed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. THAT, had Suzanne Kemp's efforts been acknowledged for what they signified, a finding against Professor Orr that he seduced Miss Kemp would have been impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. THAT, whilst Professor Orr's case against the University lay sub judice, a certain `Diary' or purported diary of Suzanne Kemp for 1955, was altered and thereby falsified. This was between the month of March 1956 and October 1956, when Professor Orr's case came on for trial, or so it would appear. It could, however, have been altered even after the trial commenced. It would appear that such alteration was not made upon the initiative of Miss Kemp, and was therefore without fault on her part. By means of such falsification, vital evidence in Professor Orr's favour was suppressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. THAT Stanley Burbury would appear to have had knowledge of such suppression of evidence. He was on the Committee advising and instructing the lawyers involved in the preparation of the University defence. I say that it is inconceivable that such alteration and suppression would have been made without his knowledge and approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. THAT in addition, and during the same period in 1956, the so-called diary for 1955 was altered in such a manner as to amount to the fabrication of evidence, capable of being interpreted to Professor Orr's disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. THAT Stanley Burbury should be presumed to have had knowledge of such fabrication of evidence and to have been party to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. THAT Judge Green chose to ignore the obvious suppression of vital evidence, and that in addition he chose to misinterpret the fabricated evidence to Professor Orr's disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. THAT he unreasonably yet deliberately accepted the so-called diary as affording that confirmation which he acknowledged as being essential to the acceptance of viva voce evidence given by Miss Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. THAT during the period when Orr's case lay sub judice, Stanley Burbury was appointed to and accepted the position of Chief Justice of Tasmania; and that it must be concluded that such appointment could have affected both the conduct and outcome of Professor Orr's case against the University of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. THAT Judge Green suspended reason and abandoned impartiality towards Orr, in that he knowingly and deliberately ignored those clues in Miss Kemp's evidence by which she gave indication that an incident on the beach at Bellerive in August of 1955, did not involve Professor Orr, but, instead, involved another person whose existence had been obscured by the suppression of evidence in the alteration of the diary. I state that Miss Kemp, in the giving of her evidence would appear to have been in effect, blackmailed over this other person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. THAT by reason of blatant disregard by Judge Green of the date established by the unchallenged evidence of one, Noel Edward Gathercole, Judge Green took the liberty of finding that the said incident had involved Professor Orr, the obvious impossibility of its having done so notwithstanding</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. THAT, having regard to apparent conspiracy, blackmail, suppression of and fabrication of evidence as heretofore alleged, all other unsupported allegations in Miss Kemp's evidence as to incidents elsewhere than at Bellerive, should be regarded as no more than thistledown; apparently supplied on demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26. THAT the Judges of the High Court of Australia: Dixon C.J., together with Williams and Taylor J.J., did likewise resort to wilful disregard of certain of Miss Kemp's 7 evidence, in such a manner and to such effect as to lead them to support and affirm Judge Green's absurd mishandling of the materials before him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27. THAT the High Court Judgement therefore contained and re-inforced the same absurdity with regard to Bellerive, such as had been a feature of the original Judgement of Green J.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. THAT the Judges of the High Court would appear to have been aware of this; inasmuch as they even pretended that this same obvious absurdity amounted to an incident especially damning of Professor Orr. That they concurred in such absurdity, I allege tends to support belief in conspiracy, even on their part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. THAT it must appear that they did this with the intention of lending their authority; the authority of the High Court of Australia, to the cover-up of crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. THAT, in the ultimate, it must appear that the High Court judges were deliberately choosing to cover-up for Chief Justice Burbury of Tasmania, even though this had to be by way of denying justice to Professor Orr: the new Chief Justice of Tasmania being at considerable risk were the matter to have been decided in Professor Orr's favour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31. THAT various arms of Government in Tasmania would appear to have been engaged in cover-up; by attempt either to discredit or to frame such critics as the Deponent hereof, by means of a shooting incident in December 1959, at the home of Professor Orr.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32. THAT I express my willingness to appear before any inquiry such as a Royal Commission, in order that I might adduce evidence and argument in support of the allegations contained herein.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then there is reference to `Stanley Burbury, KBE, KCVO, KCMG, Solicitor-General, Chief Justice, and, ultimately, Governor of the State of Tasmania'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lest it be thought that the above allegations be utterly beyond belief, I make further allegation regarding the conduct, and by implication, the character of Stanley Burbury. In doing so, I claim liberty under the provisions of Sec. 206. l.(d) of the Tasmanian Criminal Code Act, 1924, relating to Fair Comment; and I claim this liberty also with regard to comment concerning legal practitioner John Bruce Piggott.</PARA>
<PARA>I will conclude there for this evening, Mr President, but I indicate that there is a little more that I will bring to the attention of the Senate at the next available opportunity. It is important to read this in its entirety.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I rise on this debate on the adjournment to highlight a major deficiency in a vital public service to this country. The weather bureau is in serious trouble and senior officers have revealed this in spades in the annual report this year. This document reveals that the ALP government is making financial cuts to the services of the weather bureau which are having very dangerous effects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner was fully questioned about this in the estimates process last week but all he could say was, `We are going to have an inquiry into it.' He does not need an inquiry because the annual report lays the record bare for everyone to see. It reveals an appalling state of affairs with the Bureau of Meteorology complaining about systematic cuts to its budget over many years. A desperate bureau is increasingly critical of this government. It is virtually without precedent in annual reports that a government department would be so desperate to be so critical. Let's see why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureau can no longer guarantee that dangerous weather warnings will be issued. I remind the Senate and the Australian people that we are talking about storm warnings, wind warnings, hailstorm warnings, fire risk warnings. Given the nature of this country and its extremes in weather, it is not too hard to see that if this situation were to continue, not only would it put people's livelihoods in jeopardy, it would put lives in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weather bureau's report does reveal the extent of the cuts. The report said that, from the 1993-94 budget to the 1995-96 budget, funding was decreased from $117 million to $112 million, a cut of $5 million. This cut was not just a one-off. It has been going on systematically over the years through what the government calls its efficiency dividend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fine for government departments to be efficient&mdash;that is laudable&mdash;and sometimes funding needs to be cut for them to become more efficient. They sometimes need to cut the fat out. But, in this case, what the government has done is cut the effectiveness of the organisation, and that is something a government should never do, particularly when it affects a service as vital to Australia as the weather bureau. Let us look at what the bureau's own annual report said the effects of all this were. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the impacts of staff and operational funding reductions began to cut deeply into the quality . . . and the reliability of the basic data collection.</PARA>
<PARA>The quality and reliability were affected. Isn't that a damning statement? And it came from the bureau itself. The government's $5 million efficiency dividend this year is ripping the guts out of an essential, life-preserving service to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cut in funding&mdash;apart from affecting the day-to-day services that people in Australia need&mdash;is also drastically affecting long-term weather and climate predictions. In a country which has one of the driest climates in the world, and probably one of the most vulnerable climates in the world, this is an act of administrative vandalism. The government is compromising the standard of data collection, and the ongoing climate record will actually have gaps. We have international obligations to provide accurate data that will form part of a world pattern of data collection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supposed to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world but, because of what this government has done to the country over the last 13 years, we find that we have a vital public service that is not funded properly, so it cannot fulfil its full role. As I indicated earlier, all that Minister Faulkner could say at the estimates hearing was, `We are going to review it.' That is not acceptable. That review is not needed because the review is already in the annual report and it points the government in the direction it should be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weather bureau has the function of maintaining reliable and high quality data, both in terms of immediate weather records and long-term climate records. This government is now placing Australians at risk by not allowing this department to function effectively. Dr Zillman, from the bureau, is obviously appalled, given the tone of his own annual report. It is the responsibility of us in the Senate to make the public aware that this government is not performing yet again in another area. This is yet another reason for a change at the next election. </PARA>

I look, for example, at the Australian Workers Union&mdash;a union which is very large in Queensland, where the present industrial chaos seems to be emanating from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After looking at the internal factional disputes within such large unions, and according to the allegations made by unionists themselves, the unions appear to be not only not democratic but also incompetent and are certainly not doing their jobs. One document put out at a recent AWU election reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For anyone who has ever read the history of the Australian Workers Union, you'll know that we were the Union who led this nation in industrial relations achievements for our members by delivering the goods to the working men and women of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have forgotten the workers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not from the employers, that is not from the Liberal Party; that is from a how to vote ticket put out at the last election for that union. I noticed it mentioned payments and misused hard-earned funds. I have here a photocopy of a cheque made out by the Australian Workers Union, Members Welfare Association No. 1 Account, to Mr Bob Kernohan, who I understand ran on a ticket with Mr Bob Smith as the AWU-FIME's unity team. The cheque is made out for $6,500 and is dated 6 April 1995. The signatures here look something like J. Collins&mdash;and I cannot work out the other signature. Perhaps Minister Schacht, after looking at this document, might give me leave to table it. I ask him, with the normal courtesies, whether he would give me approval to table the document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On an earlier occasion I mentioned this union and spoke of a Mr Bob Smith, who was the Victorian union secretary from 1990 to 1992. He has since been described as being discredited and is certainly not the same Bob Smith who is presently involved in the union. Another election dodger dated June 1992 from this union states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal President Bill Ludwig and Federal Secretary Mike Forshaw put the situation under wraps&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the development from the Bob Smith episode&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and Executive Council places the finances of the Victorian Branch under Forshaw's control. With some heavy-handed persuasion, the Branch Executive is persuaded to "invite" WA Branch Secretary Bruce Wilson across as Acting Secretary . . . Bruce Wilson has had an amazing career. He was defeated by the rank-and-file in his 1989 challenge to Errol Hodder for general secretary, but then appointed as WA Branch Secretary two years later. Good career move!!! Then a year later, he was appointed as Acting Secretary of the Victorian Branch. After Bob Smith is away on leave over six months (!!!), Wilson was finally appointed as fully legal Victorian Secretary in February last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Branch members in either Victoria OR Western Australia haven't had a chance to pass judgement on these extraordinary happenings in Perth and Melbourne. The last time Victorian AWU members had a chance to judge Bruce, in electing Annual Convention delegates, his team of candidates were clearly rejected. Over the past two years, the sackings and cutbacks have continued&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in the branch office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at an alarming pace. No accurate figures are available, but informed guesses have Branch membership at less than half the 1990 membership (i.e. less than 8,750 financial). On top of this, AWU-FIME National Executive have attempted to merge the Western Australian and Victorian Branches of the AWU&mdash;and unify control in a small Divisional Executive. For Victorian members, the situation is farcical.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not from the Liberal Party; it is from one of the factions in the AWU. Another faction in the AWU states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The History of AWU&mdash;FIME 1995 Election started with the AWU Executive Council hijacking of the NSW AWU Federal Branch. The NSW AWU Branch had over a million dollars in investment, it owned properties including it's own office building and had a healthy membership, giving the trend of the size of Unions these days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Branch Executives was made up of some paid officials and a fixed proportion of Rank and File members which ensured that the Union did not become directed by professional officers to the detriment of members. The members were receiving a good level of service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the treachery of the `National Secretaries', Steve Harrison and Michael Forshaw, the amalgamation was completed without the NSW AWU Federal Branch being fully consulted on the final issue of the amalgamation or the `Rules' of the amalgamated Unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This led to a set of Rules being drawn up mainly by FIME's legal council and a member of the `Executive Council' without the protection of advice from the AWU Solicitors, Carroll and O'Dea which was a requirement that the NSW AWU Branch Executive had made a condition of the negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Rank and File representation on the Branch Executive being `swamped' by paid officers and organisers. This gave the `Branch Secretary' unlimited influence as he has control over the employed Branch Executive Committee members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The amalgamated Branch Executive of the AWU&mdash;FIME had a voting bias of 32 to 14 in favour of FIME.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Manipulation of Union Elections resulted in the fact that FIME Office Holders would stay in the office until 1997, yet the AWU office holders had to go to election in 1995, with FIME members entitled to nominate and vote in the ballot for positions on the AWU Executive. This led to FIME being able to force a deal that `blackmailed' the existing NSW AWU Federal Branch Executive Members from nominating in the Elections now being conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incumbent AWU Branch Executives were to be replaced by a team of candidates endorsed by FIME which included Farley and Innis, who were not members of either the AWU or FIME, and are in fact members of the Clerks Union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Commonwealth `Electoral Officer' ruled that Farley and Innis should supply further proof of membership, one or both of the Joint Secretaries `falsified' evidence of membership to support Farley and Innis' return to the Ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What was further disturbing was when Innis failed to prove her eligibility she then claimed membership of TAP. At this stage there is evidence that the ticket dated April 1992 was issued this year, 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why Farley and Innis withdrew from the Ballot after being challenged by Ernie Ecob in the Court to prove their membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a report that there are some `irate' Rank and File members who wished to nominate in the Union Election but were talked out of it by Eddie and Olsen, who were telling members they would not have a chance of winning. These two organisers however, were supporting non-members Farley and Innis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Steve Harrison has already bankrupted four good unions and now the AWU is on his list. Forshaw is wallowing in the Senate unperturbed of what his treachery bought to a once proud and secure union, the AWU.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the Liberal Party saying that; it is union faction fighting. We are being told that the unions are there to protect the rank and file and to protect people in this situation. It is no wonder that so many workers at CRA would prefer to look after their own arrangements when they get a better deal out of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a letter here signed by T.J. Murphy, who protests that he was prepared to be blackmailed out of standing for office in the union that he had served for over 40 years in order to keep some semblance of AWU identity in the amalgamated New South Wales federal branch. I might be able to deal with that letter on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is that here we have a situation where the union movement, particularly this very large and very important union, is rent by factional divisions and where the internecine fighting is more in the interests of the executives of the union than of the workers. One can understand why so many Australian workers are now deciding that unions are there not to protect their interests but to protect the interests of the union executives and why they are seeking to do workplace agreements or individual agreements with employers like CRA. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief minute I have left I want to make two brief points. It was raised before about Senator Bell's remarks under privilege about the history of the Orr case. Senator Calvert commented about using privilege. Senator Calvert, I just want to say that Senator Bell will be judged accordingly about whether people believe he has used privilege in the wrong or the right way. I am a strong believer in parliamentary privilege. I think Senator Bell or any senator has to make the judgment about how they use it. I think it was quite relevant for him, if he wanted to, to make those comments tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comment I want to make is about Senator Baume's remarks and use of material from a union election. It is well known, Senator Baume, that union elections are very robustly fought in Australia across the board and lots of material is distributed, just as in recent times in Coles-Myer there has been a very robust discussion about accusations and investigations about misuse of shareholders' funds and so on in that particular company. So before we point the finger at unions, we also should understand that there are many companies in Australia which have brought disgrace on this country by their performance and the way the directors have acted in the last 10 years. </PARA>
