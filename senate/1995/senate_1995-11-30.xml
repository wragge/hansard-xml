<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) The farmer milk suppliers to King Island Dairy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BECAUSE of the actions of the accounting firm Touche Ross and Company acting under direction from The State of Tasmania the following occurred:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In October 1986 the King Island Dairy properties were sold for $300,000. Three weeks prior to the sale the accountants Touche Ross and Co, who were acting as receivers for the secured creditor The Tasmanian Development Authority (as agent for the Minister), had declared in a signed declaration to the state Corporate Affairs office the properties were worth approximately $1.7 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The sale price excluded valuation and payment for the Trade Marks and Brands owned by King Island Dairy, which were a valuable asset of King Island Dairy, then, as they are now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The decision by the State of Tasmania to seize the King Island Dairy and, through the receivers, direct its sale to Transequity Ltd, impacted on the small dairy farming community of King Island. There was no `safety net' arranged by the Tasmanian government to prevent abuse by Transequity Ltd of its dominant milk purchasing position above the milk suppliers. In the nine years since the sale it is estimated the King Island dairy farmers have received $2 million less for their milk than farmers producing milk for equivalent purposes in Victoria. This is an estimated price underpayment of approximately $100,000 per average King Island family dairy farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) When the Kirk Family tried to publish the story of the injustice, action was taken by the former Premier of Tasmania, Mr R.T. Gray and an associate Mr P.G. Morgan, to institute defamation proceedings against W.J. Kirk and Australia Post. Messrs Morgan and Gray obtained injunctions in early 1989 restraining W.J. Kirk and Australia Post from publishing and distributing material concerning the sale of the King Island Dairy. At the date of this petition neither Mr Gray or Mr Morgan, have taken their defamation proceedings to trial. The injunctions remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a separate action Agricorp Ltd and Butterfields Cheese Factors Pty Ltd succeeded in obtaining judgment from Master Wheeler in the Supreme Court of Victoria against W.J. and R.E. Kirk, for defamation. Master Wheeler entered judgment against the Kirks after declining an application by the Kirks to enter a late defence. The Kirks declined to pay the judgment debt and were made bankrupt on the petition of Agricorp and Ors in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">WE the undersigned, humbly request honourable members to deal with our grievance in the matter of sale of King Island Dairy as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee scrutinised the usual large number of disallowable legislative instruments tabled in the Senate, made under the authority of scores of parent Acts administered through virtually every Department of State. Almost every legislative scheme relies on delegated legislation to provide the administrative details of programs set out in broad policy in parent Acts which authorise such delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure that they conform to the high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties which the Senate applies to Acts. If the Committee detects any breach of these standards it writes to the Minister or other law-maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives notice of a motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual, by the end of the sittings Ministers have given the Committee undertakings to amend many provisions in different instruments or parent Acts to meet its concerns, reflecting a continuing high level of cooperation from Ministers in its non-partisan operations. The Committee is grateful for this cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee scrutinised 879 instruments, which is an historically high number. Of these, 199 were statutory rules, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series of delegated legislation. The other 680 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the 879 instruments was scrutinised by the Committee under its four principles, or terms of reference, which are included in the Standing Orders. There were 96 prima facie defects or matters worthy of comment in those 879 instruments. The defects are described below under each of the four principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle is interpreted broadly by the Committee to include not only technical invalidity, but also every other aspect of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under s.48(2) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS> an instrument to which that provision applies is void if it prejudicially affects any person apart from the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. The Explanatory Statement for one instrument advised that it operated retrospectively to 1 July 1995 to provide continuity for agreements in respect of gambling activities which expired on 30 June 1995. The Committee asked whether any person was disadvantaged by this, whether any activities were conducted without legal authority after 30 June, whether there was a legal hiatus after that date, and whether any person could have avoided a contract after that date. Another instrument, which was made on 26 September 1995, purported to forbid specified activities from 1 January 1995. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that it did not operate retrospectively. This would have been the case if s.48(2) applied from the date of making an instrument, but it applies from the date of gazettal, which was 14 days later. Two other instruments did not notify the date of gazettal, although both provided for this to be done. On the other hand, the Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that its retrospectivity was not prejudicial, although no retrospectivity was evident on its face, while another instrument was made on a date later than it was gazetted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under s.49A of the Acts Interpretation Act an instrument to which that provision applies may incorporate provisions of an Act or delegated legislation in force from time to time, but may only incorporate other material as in force when the instrument takes effect. The Committee ascertains that such incorporations are valid. One instrument incorporated an instrument made under a specified provision of an Act, with no indication of date of making, heading, or any other identifying reference. Another instrument incorporated a Schedule published by the Department, again with no reference to a date. Another incorporated a government strategy and other packages and initiatives, with no indication of the effect of changes to those programs. Another provided for a list of superannuation schemes and incorporated any future changes to the names of the schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised other aspects of validity. For instance, subdelegation of legislative power without express statutory authority is generally invalid. Two instruments subdelegated authority to determine conditions of service. It was not clear whether provisions in another instrument were intended to be legislative, in which case they would have been invalid, or administrative. Another instrument may not have complied with mandatory conditions required by the enabling Act. Another was made under the wrong provision, with the Explanatory Statement also advising that it was made under the same wrong provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drafting of delegated legislation should be of the same standard as that of Acts. The Committee raised a number of apparent drafting defects. One instrument included obsolete expressions such as laundryman and kitchenman. Another may have been unnecessarily complex. Another provided for an offence but did not provide for a penalty. Another was numbered incorrectly. Another provided for the continuation of a provision which was a legal nullity. An Explanatory Statement included wrong references to legislative requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other instruments may have affected parliamentary propriety. One provided for the Minister to act in a dual capacity as Minister and as the Lotteries Commission, a number of provisions giving the Minister power to approve his or her own decisions. In another case there was an apparent delay of some years in a statutory requirement to make an instrument as soon as practicable. Another instrument did not provide criteria for the appointment of members of an authority which had considerable powers. Another instrument, made to correct an inadvertent error which affected members of the public, took 10 months to make. Another instrument provided for the Minister to delegate important powers to any person at all. Another instrument did not provide for any delegation, even although this appeared necessary. Numbers of instruments did not include a system of numbering or citation, which may be confusing to users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (b)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle in the broadest way, to include every aspect of personal rights. During the sittings the Committee detected the following possible defects in delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions of delegated legislation should not operate harshly or unfairly. One instrument provided for an application affecting business operations to be received within three days of the date upon which the instrument was made. Another provided for certain Commonwealth employees to elect to "contract out" of new beneficial leave rights in some areas in order to avoid new detrimental leave provisions in another area. In this case the Committee asked for how long the elections would operate and when it was intended that employees should come under the new beneficial provisions. Another instrument provided for people to comply with an October 1995 publication of the Department from 1 December 1995. In this case the Committee asked what notice and publicity the new publication had received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Offence provisions should be reasonable. One instrument provided for a number of offences punishable by fines of $50,000 to be heard by a court of summary jurisdiction. Some of those offences, punishable by such large fines, were strict liability offences. Some of these strict liability offences were inconsistent with similar offences which did not involve strict liability. For instance, some offences were committed if a person did not comply with an issued notice while others were guilty only if they did not comply with an issued notice which was actually received. Another provision reversed the usual onus of proof in relation to various statements in the complaint relating to an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fees and charges set by delegated legislation should be reasonable and their basis explained by the Explanatory Statement. One instrument doubled virtually all fees without explanation, in one case to $20,000. Another set a new licence fee at $2,600, again without explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Retrospective provisions, even if valid, should not be unusual or unexpected. One instrument provided for retrospective operation from 1992 of aspects of a public sector superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also protects personal privacy. One instrument provided for the mandatory inclusion of the date of birth of certain employees on a list, although this did not appear to be necessary for the purposes of the list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (c)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many instruments of delegated legislation provide for Ministers, statutory office holders and other public officials to exercise discretions. The Committee believes that such discretions should be as narrow as possible, include objective criteria to limit and guide their exercise, and include review of the merits of decisions by an external, independent tribunal, which would normally be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee scrutinies closely instruments which provide for discretions which could adversely affect business activities. The Explanatory Statement for one instrument advised that certain companies would be required to report regularly to a government agency to demonstrate compliance with a standard. The instrument itself did not, however, appear to provide for this, or for review of an adverse decision by the agency. Another instrument provided for review of a decision by a surveyor employed by a government agency. The Committee noted that the Minister had statutory authority to give directions to the agency and suggested that AAT review, at least of the surveyor's decision, may be appropriate. Another instrument provided for AAT review of a decision not to grant or to revoke a permit, but not of a decision to impose conditions on a permit. One instrument provided for a discretion to refund fees where it appeared that the legislative intent was to give a refund in all relevant cases. Another provided a discretion to refund although the Explanatory Statement advised that a policy decision to return money on an agreed basis had been agreed with industry representatives. The Explanatory Statement for another advised that the effect of a discretion was ambulatory in effect, but the instrument itself did not provide for review of an adverse decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other discretions affecting business which may not have provided for merits review included decisions to suspend a subsidy payment, to decide whether something was outside a person's control and to grant a licence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Internal review of the merits of administrative decisions is usually not as satisfactory as external review by an independent body. One instrument provided only for review by the Minister. Even if the Minister could not delegate this power it may not have been satisfactory for the Minister to review decisions of the Department which he or she administers or of authorities within the Minister's portfolio. Another instrument provided not only for the Minister to review decisions which could affect business, but also provided for the Minister to delegate this power of review to any person at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also scrutinies closely instruments which provide for apparently unreviewable discretions which may affect personal rights. One such instrument provided for a discretion to decide whether a person was financially disadvantaged and another for a discretion to alter individual accrued superannuation benefits. Another provided for decisions relating to programs for the long term unemployed, whether a person was affected by a decision not to release a forest coupe, whether a person had unreasonably delayed taking certain action and whether a person had taken reasonable steps.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (d)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not raise this principle as often as its other three principles. Nevertheless, it is a principle which goes to the heart of parliamentary propriety and complements the first principle, that an instrument should be in accordance with the statute.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Approved Occupational Clothing Guidelines made under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wishes to report briefly to the Senate on its scrutiny of the Approved Occupational Clothing Guidelines, which provide for employee income tax deductibility of such clothing. The Guidelines, which affect great numbers of Australian wage and salary employees and which also have an effect on the national revenue, were not of the quality which the Senate would expect from legislation made by the executive under the authority of an Act of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guidelines were made under section 51AL of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</EMPHASIS> which provides that expenditure incurred by an employee in relation to a non-compulsory uniform or wardrobe is not tax deductible unless the clothing was entered on a Register kept by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. The section also required the Minister to formulate Guidelines setting out criteria for the entry of clothes on the Register. The first set of Guidelines came into effect on 1 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present set of Guidelines amended the old Guidelines in respect of a number of matters. The new Guidelines were made by the Minister on 7 June 1995 with no express commencement date, although the Explanatory Statement did advise that transitional provisions then in force expired on 30 June 1995. The Guidelines consisted of 57 consecutively numbered clauses, some of which were in italics, some not in italics and some in both italics and non-italics. Some of the clauses were also partly in bold. A Note at the start of the Guidelines stated that the material in italics was explanatory only and did not form part of the Guidelines. Nevertheless, clause 3, in italics, provided:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"3. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">These Guidelines supersede those of 1 September 1993 and are effective as of 7 June 1995. The changes in these Guidelines are not retrospective."</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guidelines were, however, subject to s.48(2) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901,</EMPHASIS> under which an instrument has no effect if, before gazettal, the instrument purports to affect rights or impose liabilities on any person other than the Commonwealth. The Committee ascertained that the Guidelines had not been gazetted until 21 June 1995, so it appeared that the Guidelines may have been void for prejudicial retrospectivity. There was also the advice in the Explanatory Statement which appeared to state that the old Guidelines were in force up to 30 June 1995. The Committee raised these concerns with the Minister. The Committee also gave a protective notice of disallowance of the Guidelines, in order to preserve its options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister advised that the new Guidelines were made to take account of concerns from employers and uniform suppliers that the original Guidelines were difficult to apply. The new Guidelines would make it easier for genuine corporate uniforms or wardrobes to be admitted to the Register and so gain tax deductibility. For instance, the maximum number of colours and shades that could be used in a design was increased from five to eight, the minimum size of corporate identifiers on accessories was reduced and there was greater flexibility for differing uniforms where the employer maintains separate public identities. Another clause which provided that single items of occupational clothing, other than full body garments, would not be admitted to the Register, merely stated in another way the equivalent clauses in the original Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister further advised, however, that there was one minor area where the new Guidelines were more strict than the original ones. Corporate identifiers must now be permanently affixed in a different way. The Minister advised that this difference had not, in practice, affected adversely the rights of any applicant seeking admission to the Register. This is because the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, which administers the Guidelines, did not reject any applications dated between 7 June and 21 June 1995 which would have satisfied the original Guidelines but not the new ones. Also, any applications approved between those two dates which would have satisfied the new Guidelines but not the old, would be eligible for tax deductibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister then advised that the Guidelines had actually commenced on gazettal on 21 June 1995. This was because the paragraph in the published text of the Guidelines which stated that they commenced on 7 June 1995, was expressed to be explanatory only and was thus not part of the Guidelines proper. The Minister therefore advised that both from a technical legal viewpoint and in practice the old Guidelines continued to operate until 21 June 1995, and that the difference between the date on which the new Guidelines were expressed to take effect and the date of notification in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> had no prejudicial impact upon the rights or liabilities of any person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee agreed to accept the Minister's advice and to remove its notice of motion of disallowance. The Committee agreed, however, that the situation was far from satisfactory. The Minister expressly advised that the published commencement date for the operation of tax deductibility for occupational clothing was wrong, which is an undesirable outcome for such an important document ultimately affecting large numbers of working Australians. The Committee also noted the Minister's advice that no person was actually disadvantaged, but observed that this appeared to be because for two weeks in the last month of the financial year the TCFDA apparently administered both the old and new Guidelines simultaneously, albeit applying only the relevant beneficial provisions of both sets of Guidelines. The Committee noted that this generosity was not universal in taxation matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's scrutiny of the Guidelines illustrates how the Committee operates to carry out the mandate of the Senate to ensure that delegated legislation is of high quality. In the present case the Guidelines, while valid, left something to be desired from the viewpoint of sound public administration. The Committee makes a special statement whenever it considers that there is an aspect of its scrutiny on which the Senate should be more closely informed and the Approved Occupation Clothing Guidelines are such a matter.</PARA>

It is responsible for the delay since then because it could have listed this matter for debate at the usual time of Government Business and the Senate would have had to deal with the matter. Senator Harradine has made clear previously his concerns with the Therapeutic Goods Administration and no doubt would want to pursue these concerns whenever legislation of this nature arises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you might ask: why has the government delayed debate on this bill and not given it proper priority, even since October this year? The government knew that whenever the Therapeutic Goods Administration Bill came before this chamber I would be raising the very serious issue of a breach of undertaking given by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Department of Health at the time in respect of RU486 and abortifacients. Those undertakings were given as far back as 1988. Since the government will not deliver those undertakings which were acknowledged by the former minister, Senator Richardson, as having been breached, I intend to ensure, by way of amendment, that something is done about it and that proper ministerial responsibility is placed on the minister concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

I know the opposition is concerned about those delays. I am certainly concerned about those delays. It is on the government's shoulders to ensure that those delays are not countenanced any further and that the matter comes up for consideration at a time which would enable the bill to pass with the amendments, hopefully prior to the end of this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Senate to vote accordingly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that Senator Harradine has seen fit to move this motion this morning. I do think every effort has been made to involve Senator Harradine and other senators in the chamber, whatever political party they represent or, in Senator Harradine's case, as an Independent, in the program that has been proposed for government legislation this week. Senator Harradine, along with a number of other senators in this chamber, has been involved in discussions to not only look at the routine of business of the Senate, not only look at the hours of sitting for the Senate, but also examine the issue of the prioritisation of the legislation that we have before us.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is also fair to make the point that at none of those discussions did he raise the issue of giving this a higher priority. It comes really as a bolt out of the blue for me today, given that he is proposing a change in the government business to debate the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill after the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). </PARA>

We have consulted with the Independent, minor party senators and the opposition ad nauseam.

As you acknowledged in your contribution, it is difficult to set priorities of legislation. All the legislation that we have before us is important. All of it warrants the attention of this Senate before it rises for the Christmas break.

We do not take much joy in putting it where Senator Harradine proposes to move it, but we do accept for two   reasons that there is legitimacy to it. The first is that he has presented an argument for why this bill, which has been hanging around in the background for a long time, should be placed higher up on the program than it is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I feel this chamber should take precedence over any agreement that is made in a whips meeting. Obviously, those who attend whips meetings have a responsibility to consider the views of the chamber, so we should not need to reconsider a decision that has been made in a whips meeting. However, we have the right to do it at any time. This Senate determines its program, and it cannot be determined by a deal between all the parties in the Senate in a meeting outside it, in my view. That is the reason why we are supporting this motion. </PARA>

<PARA>Australia is no longer just an observer to the events unfolding in the former Yugoslavia. We are now a central player. Not only has Australia been chosen as a favourite destination for nearly 14,000 refugees from the war zone, but hundreds of Australians who left to fight in the civil war are now beginning to return home. The Refugee Council has recently stated that it is absolutely impossible with our screening procedures to prevent war criminals coming in with those refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is therefore not just becoming a haven for witnesses to atrocities; it is fast becoming a refuge for those who have carried out the atrocities. The refugee community is well aware of stories of their former tormentors being seen in the psychiatrist's waiting room, at the English language class, at the school gate, at the shops and at the markets. These rumours are supported by the special prosecutor to the International War Crimes Tribunal in Holland, Mr Graham Blewett, who has said that the existence of war criminals in Australia is not a likelihood; it is a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is Australia doing about this problem? Australia has signed an agreement that allows us to send people accused of war crimes to be tried before the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. But, with just two trial chambers and trials lasting up to two months, the tribunal will process a maximum of eight trials a year or only about 100 cases in the five years it is expected to run. It was for this reason that Mr Blewett has encouraged individual countries, including Australia, to establish their own investigations and prosecutions. A spokesman for the Bosnian Council of New South Wales, Dr Dzemal Hadzismajlovic, supports this call. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to see the Australian government establish reliable mechanisms to prevent the entry of war criminals into Australia. We want to see the Australian government conduct serious investigations of the presence of war criminals.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe the Australian people do not want such people living in our community as if nothing has happened. Do we really want to risk people continuing to act out their hatred in Australia? In 1987 a special investigations unit was established by the Commonwealth to investigate and prosecute World War II criminals in Australia. There were massive inquiries. Amongst the 841 people who were the subject of such inquiries, 261 had died, 247 could not be located and in 191 cases the allegations could not be substantiated, mainly due to lack of evidence. The unit's special investigator, Mr Robert Greenwood QC, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we had held war crimes trials when we should have, it would have been a completely different story. The accused would have been young to middle aged men: the witnesses memories would have been fresh and the documentary evidence easily retrieved.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that Australia should learn from these mistakes. We should not make them again. The criminals have gained ground and the innocent in the Bosnian conflict who have fled are left in no-man's-land. In this respect, the whole evil machinations and deeds will have had some success. The haters will have won. The big job for us in Australia is to make sure the haters do not win here. I commend to the Senate the motion I have moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not imagine for a minute that there is a person in this chamber who would disagree with the intent of the motion moved by the Australian Democrats. Nobody wants Australia to be a hiding place for war criminals from any sphere of conflict, including that of former Yugoslavia. Unlike our position in World War II, where graphic reports of the war were not as frequent as they have been in the war in the former Yugoslavia and even in the Vietnam War, for example, we have seen daily on our television sets the consequences of the devastation that war brings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise that point to indicate that I think there is a much greater awareness now in this generation than there was in the past of the atrocities that are committed, sadly, during a war, of the desire to do something about that and certainly of the desire not to allow Australia to be some sort of hiding place. That is obviously something everyone would agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is another matter to move from the sentiment of a motion that says, `Yes, that's a goal that we want to achieve,' to say that the detail of the motion is how you would want to get to that end. I note, for example, that the Democrats say, `The Senate should call on the Australian government to commence work on a legislative regime that will provide for bringing to justice the perpetrators of murder, rape and the destruction of cultural property in former Yugoslavia.' I do not think you could draw a broader net if you possibly tried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Senator Spindler understands that there might be murders completely unrelated to war. Certainly, sadly, it is the experience in every nation that there are rapes completely unrelated to any particular war. While this is certainly not a matter about which we want to jest in any way, to have a crime such as the destruction of cultural property seems to me to be a lawyer's superannuation fund, to say the least, in that it is an inadequately described offence, if I can put it in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree very strongly that Australia should not allow itself to be a hiding place for these people who commit these atrocious crimes and that we have a role to play in bringing these people to justice. Senator Spindler rightly pointed out the moves that were made last year to contribute to that. He may be right when he says that the moves are not enough and that there is not enough funding and capacity so that the war criminals can be dealt with as swiftly as they should be in The Hague. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is certainly right when he points out the difficulties that the special investigations unit, established in the late 1980s, had because of the time delay. There was an enormous amount of extra effort required in checking and rechecking evidence and needing more people to back up a point because of the time delay. Evidence goes stale; memories fail. That is not so much of a problem now, and he is right in saying that these matters have to be attended to as swiftly as possible. But that does not mean that we should necessarily set up a special investigations unit now in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Senator Spindler, you have made your points. But since you so rudely interject, I will respond. You say that they are here now. But surely you do not deny that there may be more to come. Also, presumably you would not disagree with setting up a much better screening program than already exists and perhaps targeted to this particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government we have seen&mdash;as I am sure you would be aware, Senator Spindler, through your experience on the Legal and Constitutional References Committee&mdash;completely inadequate screening processes for people of a criminal kind coming into this country; those who shift in and out quite freely to engage in their criminal activities. They are simply not doing the job and they drastically need to be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we support the intent of the motion. We do not believe there would be anybody in the nation at large, let alone this parliament, who alone would disagree with the intent of the motion that war criminals should be brought to justice&mdash;and brought to justice as swiftly as possible. We do not support the motion primarily because we believe it is inappropriately drafted, and that it is not clear yet that it is appropriate for us to set up a special investigations unit here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do acknowledge that there are other things that need to be done and raise, just as one example in the limited time, vastly improved screening processes. I understand, Senator Spindler, that that does not deal with the people who are already here. But it does do something about stopping any more of these people taking advantage of us and using our country as a hiding place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human rights subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is currently conducting public hearings on the issue of former Yugoslavia. We already have had a number of pieces of public and private information relating to war criminals and, indeed, the need to enhance the standing and the resources of the War Crimes Tribunal. That obviously has been acknowledged by people right across the board. Of course, there are some who have not done so but, generally speaking, that has been the gravamen of much of the evidence that we have received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not yet concluded that hearing although, from memory, I think we have concluded the public hearings and the report is being written. I know that with these sorts of things it is important to bell the cat at a particular stage. But, whilst I appreciate what Senator Spindler has said, I would recommend to him and to other members of the Senate who are not members of the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to perhaps take cognisance of the report when it is brought down. I am sure that that report will be properly and adequately sourced, and its conclusions will be well founded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are talking about here is the best way to achieve shared goals. There is not a contest in this chamber about whether people who have committed war crimes should be prosecuted; it is a question of how, in the circumstances of the former Yugoslavia, we should best proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the previous circumstances which we have confronted, we have a circumstance here where the international community, through the UN, has set up a specialist tribunal dedicated to investigating and prosecuting allegations of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Australia has been very strongly in support of the establishment of that tribunal. In fact, we were one of the very first to take legislative action in response to it. The International War Crimes Tribunal Act, which commenced only a few months ago in August, enables Australia to fully assist and comply with requests from the tribunal. It provides for various forms of assistance, including, if necessary, the taking of evidence in Australia for tribunal purposes, the surrendering of suspects in Australia to the tribunal for trial and the sitting of the tribunal in Australia if it so desires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the key elements of what might need to be done in Australia, or by Australia, are in place through the proper mechanism, in this instance the specialist UN tribunal. The government has established a good working relationship with the tribunal and we are in a position to respond quickly to requests for assistance and to pass on information about sightings and follow them up. The tribunal has recently commended the Australian government for the excellent cooperation and assistance it provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware, and the government is aware, that there have been recent allegations of sightings of war criminals in Australia, and we must all accept that it is at least possible that some alleged war criminals may have entered Australia. It is virtually impossible to totally preclude this, especially in circumstances where the individuals may have gone to great lengths to create false identities. However, a substantial amount of effort is being devoted to this task through the work of an interdepartmental committee which maintains an active and systematic approach to identifying possible war criminals who may seek to enter Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a government have procedures in place to ensure that the opportunities for suspected war criminals to enter Australia are minimised. We also have a comprehensive legislative regime and administrative procedures to ensure that appropriate steps can be taken if war criminals from the former Yugoslavia are in fact found to be here in Australia. This is a regime which was extensively debated in the  parliament last year and earlier this year. That legislation was supported by the Australian Democrats, who expressed the desire, which I think we all share, to see war criminals published and noted that the prosecution of charged people should proceed as quickly and effectively as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most effective manner, in the view of the government, and I think correctly, to address war crimes allegations in relation to the former Yugoslavia is by way of the special tribunal set up by the international community to deal with these matters and to which the UN has devoted significant resources. It is suggested in this motion that the tribunal is insufficiently resourced. The resourcing of the tribunal is of course, at the end of the day, a matter for the UN General Assembly, but Australia has argued strongly in that forum for proper resourcing of the tribunal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there have been some difficulties in resolving budgetary issues, the tribunal is now up and running and is actively pursuing around 3,000 investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the proposal to establish a domestic regime for investigation and prosecution is, while I would not in any way doubt the good intentions lying behind it, fundamentally flawed. It would require, for example, a diversion of Australian resources away from the international tribunal to a domestic tribunal, where we would need to train specialist staff and develop contacts for investigations and where we would confront significant difficulties in gathering admissible evidence abroad and securing the cooperation of witnesses. We would confront the possibility of duplication of work between Australia and the tribunal, as Australia could be asked at any time to defer to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and I think it would be appropriate that we gave priority to that. Difficult issues would arise as to the adequacy of existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one is suggesting that the war crimes occurred in Australia. When we had to deal in different circumstances with suspected war criminals from World War II, the practical difficulties in mounting successful prosecutions for conduct engaged in outside Australia were made very clear. That would make investigations and trials practically impossible and prohibitively expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Justice Einfield, when recently giving evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade human rights subcommittee&mdash;and this is to some extent what Senator Harradine was referring to&mdash;referred to the problems with the World War II prosecutions and the difficulties in trying to conduct trials in Australia. He noted that we have to be realistic about the limits of our legal system and that we should be helping duly constituted tribunals to do their job rather than setting ourselves up as a substitute international tribunal. I agree with Justice Einfield's observation that the proper role for Australia is servicing and helping to make successful the international war crimes tribunals established for these specific purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an analogous situation to the World War II special investigations unit. That was a controversial decision, but it was one that the government supported. It was an attempt worth making. In that case the government took the view that it was not prepared to extradite suspects to face trials in countries which were then behind the so-called Iron Curtain. Therefore we put in place mechanisms to permit trial of the offences in Australia because there was not an alternative mechanism to have those trials which was acceptable as a level of justice to the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances there is no such reluctance to extradite. We would be prepared to extradite&mdash;and the International War Crimes Tribunal Act makes explicit provision for such extradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers it is not necessary or appropriate to set up a special investigations unit when adequate, effective and preferable mechanisms are already in place. A specialist unit&mdash;the tribunal&mdash;has been set up by the international community to bring justice to the perpetrators of war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia. The Australian government fully supports this approach as being the most suitable way to deal with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal is fully operational, and Australia is totally committed to providing maximum assistance to the tribunal. Whilst almost everybody in Australia and everybody in this chamber would support the objective of ensuring that war criminals are dealt with effectively and strongly, it does not mean that anything we might do in that regard is justified. We have to work out the best way of achieving the proper and shared goals. The procedure is already in place for cooperation with the international tribunal. That remains the most effective way for Australia to act in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In response to some of the matters raised, let me say that I believe we should not let the technical drafting difficulties raised by Senator Vanstone stand in the way of the substantive issue.

I wonder how long it will take to get that report. Once again, I am concerned about the delay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) ignores the fact that the deputy prosecutor is an Australian. The Hague tribunal has requested Australia to assist because the deputy prosecutor is of the view that current procedures are inadequate and are not working effectively and that the resources are not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the matter of expending resources in Australia, I believe that is well within the framework of our responsibilities of law enforcement in Australia because we are talking about people being here, living as part of our community, who were those perpetrators. If the situation is&mdash;and I have not heard anyone dispute Mr Graham Blewett's allegations&mdash;that that process is not working well, then I believe it is our responsibility here in Australia to apprehend those people and, if it cannot be done in the Hague then, if necessary it should be done here. It is in the interests of our community and I believe it is also in the interests of the ethnic communities concerned who do not want these sorts of people living as part of their communities or as part of the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee recognises the importance of the partnership between the Commonwealth, states and territories in the establishment of ANTA three years ago. The agreement has enabled the considerable injection of Commonwealth funds, the so-called growth funds, into the vocational education and training sector. This sector over the previous 10 years, which was completely under the control of the states, had languished with lack of growth. What has happened in recent years has, I think, started to re-establish a proper balance between the higher education sector and the vocational education and training sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence that the ANTA concept is a step forward did come out right across the hearings. No-one in any of the evidence suggested that we undo this arrangement and go back to the pre-ANTA situation. However, the committee recognises that while there has been progress in the first three years of ANTA's operations, a number of problems have been revealed with the way in which ANTA is going about its business. That does need finetuning and modification. To this end, the committee has made 20 recommendations for the improvement of the operation of the ANTA agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important of these concerns the use of growth funds, the successful measurement of outcomes, the development of a national strategy and the role of industry. With regard to growth funds provided by the Commonwealth, the committee was very concerned to find that very little of the 20 per cent of funds that had been distributed, or supposed to have been distributed, on the basis of performance required by the agreement was actually taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much more than the 80 per cent of the funds intended for growth were being distributed by ANTA on a population basis. One of the unfavourable outcomes of this was it was disadvantaging the smaller states. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the full 20 per cent of VET funds be distributed as originally intended by the agreement on the basis of performance in relation to objectives of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in recognition of the difficulties that the smaller states and territories are likely to have, the committee recommends that the formula used in the allocation of growth funds be sufficiently flexible to take into account the particular characteristics of individual states and territories, particularly with respect to their size and population distribution. To encourage ANTA's national emphasis in the use of funds, the committee recommends that of the growth funds currently available, ANTA increase the proportion that is allocated to cooperative arrangements between the states in either curriculum development or rationalisation of training courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of the evidence taken in hearings was the vexed issue of the measurement of outcomes in comparing performance of state and territory systems in delivering vocational education and training. It is very important to know that states are maintaining effort when Commonwealth funding has been increased. However, the very crude state of the outcome measures means that no meaningful conclusion can be reached at this stage. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Commonwealth parliament should extend beyond 1995 its recently relinquished power to intervene in cases where states and territories have failed to meet the obligations under the agreement and that ANTA set up a unit from within its existing staff for the express purpose of developing suitable outcome measures. This is still one of the great problems for resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, as in an earlier report on accountability of Commonwealth money in state-Commonwealth education agreements, which the committee tabled earlier this year, we discovered that it was very difficult to establish evidence one way or the other because of the way in which the various states&mdash;indeed, as we discovered, the way in which the Commonwealth government&mdash;collects statistics. Trying to get any meaningful information out of those statistics is very difficult because of the way they are collected. That is relating to inputs into education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question&mdash;this is the crucial question&mdash;of outputs. That is really what you want to know. Is the money you are spending being effectively spent? Are you getting the outcomes that you are trying to achieve? Right across the whole system there has hardly been any work done on this. That is why we made this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr has been going on in many of these hearings about trying to prove whether effort has been maintained or not. Quite frankly, as someone who has some expertise in the use of statistics and education, you just cannot draw the conclusions that Senator Carr is drawing because of the inexact nature of the measurement system. In educational research the conclusions he has come to based on the data and the way the data is collected would be considered totally invalid. This was pointed out very forcefully in the hearings by Terry Moran, the head of ANTA. I invite people to look at Terry Moran's evidence on this matter because I think it puts paid to what Senator Carr had been saying well and truly. We do recognise as a committee that there is a need to develop such measures, particularly outcome measures&mdash;hence, our recommendation 6 on ANTA setting up a unit to bring this outcome about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the national strategy in vocational education and training, the committee believes that there is much room for improvement in the process of consultation, particularly at the state and territory level, in the development of state training profiles. For this reason, the committee has recommended that ANTA devise improved mechanisms for the provision of advice to the state training authorities from various parts of industry, in particular, small business, from education and training providers and from individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We did discover that the whole arrangements in ANTA were too narrowly focused and they did not take into account or work properly enough with the small business groups. They also did not really work properly enough with a broader range of educational provision that could be deemed not strictly vocational, but being in its very nature supportive of vocational training. We felt that with its funding of TAFE systems and adult community education, it would take a much broader view in what it included in its definition of `vocational'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other main recommendations respond to the way in which the ANTA board is set up. I understand what they were trying to do. They were not trying to get representatives from every group in the community to give this broad, comprehensive umbrella. But the feeling, after hearing the evidence, was that they have actually gone a bit too far the other way and that the work of the board would be very much enhanced if three groups in particular were represented. They should have an expert in vocational education and training as part of the board, and they do not have that at the moment. Representatives from the small business sector should be part of the board as well, because of the huge number of small businesses in this country. The other sector that we felt was neglected by the board's structure was rural and regional Australia; hence we have recommended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the Senate. We feel, as I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, that the ANTA agreement has made considerable progress. It has put funding into this sector in a way that was very much needed. But at this point ANTA needs a little fine tuning in its representation and in its focus of effort. We believe the Commonwealth government, which has relinquished the power that it had for three years to step in and guide what happens in this agreement, should take up that power again, because we do not feel that ANTA is quite there. But if it acts on the recommendations we have made in this report, we believe vocational education and training in this country will be very well served. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It is a report that indicates there is opportunity within the Senate committee system to do good work. This is not a view that I express on every occasion but I think this area demonstrates there are important questions that can be addressed. I think this inquiry differs from the disgraceful performance we saw with Bond University and a number of others. Once again, I thank the committee secretariat for their professionalism and hard work in providing such terrific assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report comes at a timely part of the proceedings in regard to discussions between the states and the Commonwealth. The current ANTA agreement is ending its term and we are entering into transitional arrangements which will see, through the COAG processes, new arrangements put in place. The Taylor review is due to report to the minister and will provide a very important policy base. This report that the committee has brought down will also provide a good policy base for discussion within government and, I hope, within the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is also unusual in so far as the Labor senators and the Democrats through Senator Bell have come together to produce a minority report. So the majority report consists only of the Liberals, who have a natural majority on this committee. That must be understood. The Liberals had the opportunity to go much further than they have done here. They chose to reject those initiatives through the process. The simple reason is this: they have got an unfortunate, inherent vested interest in protecting a few lousy state governments which are absolutely obsessed with the destruction of the education system in this country. That is an enormous tragedy when we look at what is occurring in this country in terms of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many issues were addressed in the Liberals' majority report&mdash;the confused roles of ANTA, the industry-led nature of it, the failure to coordinate between the different sectors, and the differences that exist regarding the main purpose of ANTA, which has now become not much more than a mechanism for the distribution of increasing levels of Commonwealth funding. In terms of that, the Commonwealth is now contributing 35 per cent of the total VET system in this country. A massive shift has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the majority report of this committee is that it does not go far enough. It identifies a problem and, like the Liberal Party in so many ways, hasn't got any solution and can't come up with the goods. It is all very well to point the finger. The real question in politics is, `What are we going do about it?' The real problem for the Liberal Party is that it does not know what to do about it, and that really is at the nub of this. The Liberal Party, unfortunately, has produced an anaemic, pale and undistinguished report. Its main problem is that it exhibits sins of omission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor and Democrat senators are saying that there is a need to eliminate the unwieldy system of dual Commonwealth-state accountability mechanisms which allows the educational vandals in this country, like Jeff Kennett in Victoria, to smash what was once a very proud public system in such a way as to fundamentally undermine commitments that they have made through agreements and to demonstrate that they cannot really be trusted with the public dollar when it comes to education. The real problem is that they are now using Commonwealth dollars as a substitute for the appalling effort they are pursuing in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are suggesting that there needs to be a much more effective measure to ensure that the Commonwealth will is demonstrated in the VET system in this country. To that end, we are proposing that the Commonwealth ought to resume control of the VET system. We recommend that, if states can't come to the party in such an arrangement and if those administrative arrangements can't be put in place, the Commonwealth minister should resume the powers to intervene more effectively, and that would mean legislative change to the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also saying that the focus of ANTA has to change. While it is a much better system than we have ever had, the focus has to change so that the educational component of education and training is given much greater emphasis. The narrow industry model in itself is not appropriate. There has to be proper consideration of much broader questions which go to the heart of a truly educated nation. Unfortunately, in recent times we have had an undue emphasis on the training notion. I see it in some ways as harking back to a 19th century notion of education which saw workers as nothing more than hands and did not seek the broader education of our population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard we maintain that there is a need for substantial changes there, that the Commonwealth ought to be directly represented on the board of ANTA and that there should be direct educational expertise on the board of ANTA. In that capacity there needs to be a much greater improvement in the management of ANTA in terms of its focus to ensure the states maintain effort and in terms of its philosophy in making sure it is a broader approach. In terms of its governance, both educational and administrative changes need to be made to ensure there is protection for those principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think considerable attention has to be paid to the working conditions of teachers and employees in the VET system. The competitive tendering arrangements in TAFE have led to serious undermining of the quality provision of education in this country. So we are also suggesting there need to be improvements there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I turn briefly to some of the remarks Senator Tierney made about my beloved state of Victoria and the notorious Kennett government. It was said that I have got some of these issues wrong; that somehow or another inputs were not necessarily related to outputs. What a silly notion! That means that the Liberals are prepared to essentially cover up for that economic and educational vandalism in Victoria which has seen $43 million taken out of the VET system in that state. Those are the state government's own figures. If it were not for the ANTA arrangements, cuts to the VET system would have been much greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's intervention has of course sought to protect the people of Victoria. I think to some measure it has been successful. However, what is abundantly clear and now acknowledged by all is that Victoria has failed to maintain its effort and breached the agreement in financial terms. It has reduced its expenditure in 1995 and 1996 by $6.96 million and $6.84 million respectively. It is expected to breach that commitment in terms of recurrent expenditure in 1995 by $9.31 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to suggest that things are hunky-dory in terms of the maintenance of effort. They clearly are not. As far as I am concerned, the provisions about the maintenance of effort are essentially a joke because they become defined and redefined in such a way as to become meaningless. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has expressed on many occasions grave reservations about the commitment by the states, particularly Victoria and South Australia, to the whole issue of their maintenance of effort and their commitment to a national scheme. That is really what it all boils down to: the states are prepared to enter into commitments if they think they will get more money. It is the old story about never get between a state premier and a bucket of money&mdash;a very dangerous course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has to acknowledge what the states are prepared to say but then enforce commitments legislatively to ensure they are honoured if we are to have a genuine national system of education and training in this country, genuine protection for the public dollar and genuine protection for the rights and obligations that citizens have to be involved in education. As far I am concerned, if fundamental social justice issues are to be protected, the Commonwealth will have to take strong measures to ensure that the states honour their word and do not sign agreements they have no intention of keeping. Unfortunately, it is a sorry state that that has occurred again and again in this area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This inquiry into the Australian National Training Authority is an important inquiry. It is important for the industry, those involved in training in Australia, those involved in education in Australia and the wider community. It is a pity the report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the inquiry into the Australian National Training Authority</EMPHASIS>, had to arrive in two forms: a majority report, and a minority report which was endorsed by me and the Labor members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had difficulty because many parts of the committee's majority report rang true and were worthy of my support. In fact, I do support some of the recommendations. At the end of the day, the majority of the recommendations which were arrived at by me and the Labor members are the ones that expressed most closely the feeling that I had after participating in the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a difficult area to participate in because, as those who are interested in this area would know, it is rife with acronyms and much jargon. This is perpetrated, I think, by a clique of information guardians. It is a bit hard to penetrate that to get into the issues&mdash;so much so that the report includes an appendix of acronyms, which occupies 1 1/2 pages. That makes interesting reading for anyone who is involved in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was uncertain about whether I could support recommendation 1 of the majority report, so I direct people's attention to that as being indicative of the problems that we have here. But I am, however, able to fully support recommendation No. 4. I think those who are listening would understand why this expresses some of the difficulty that I, as a Tasmanian senator, and others experienced in these areas. That recommendation of the committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the formula used in the allocation of growth funds be sufficiently flexible to take into account the particular characteristics of individual States and Territories especially with respect to size and distribution of population. Such a formula might include provision for special loadings.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think I need to explain that any further. That is why we are member states of the Commonwealth&mdash;to make sure that the particular individual skills, abilities and traditions that we bring are recognised, and we are supported where the size of our population works as a disadvantage and an inability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I interpolate here that I was part of a state government department at one stage which did not have the threshold of numbers able to encourage the training&mdash;and it was training&mdash;of building quantity surveyors in Tasmania. So we had to come to a special arrangement with a Victorian institute. It was at that time the RMIT. We had to make that arrangement so that we could have in our state the skills necessary, but we were not able to provide them in any of the Tasmanian technical institutions at the time. These are the sorts of things that, of course, are brought about by population limitations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support also recommendation 5, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that ANTA establish clearly the mechanisms by which State/Territory Training Authorities take account of the projections determined by NETTFORCE&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to refer to appendix 1 to find out what that means&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and DEET's Area Consultative Committees in establishing State Training Profiles.</PARA>
<PARA>Some of those projections could be interpreted as being overstated and it is important to understand the mechanisms by which they are determined. Also, in a similar way, recommendation 7 asks that ANTA establish a reliable system of statistics. Of course, some of the debate that we have heard in the chamber this morning has been about which statistics are valid and how they ought to be taken into account. We all find difficulty when trying to interpret those statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other recommendation worthy of note is No. 17, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that schools explicitly contribute to the State Training Profiles and be given wider access to ANTA growth funds.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important also to note the minority report, which I supported. I draw attention to recommendation 7, which I will not read&mdash;senators can read that&mdash;and recommendation 8. I want to emphasise recommendation 9 because I have had some communication with ANTA personnel outside the proceedings of the committee, but also within the inquiry itself, which really asked a central question: what is the rationale behind some of the funding allocations that are made by ANTA, for example, funding allocated to develop a child-care traineeship in New South Wales when one already existed in Tasmania which had accreditation? Recommendation 9 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the National Vocational Education and Training System Agreement . . . be amended to require States and Territories to legislate the principles of the National Framework for the Recognition of Training . . . so that providers, enterprises and students are entitled to insist on national recognition of accreditation, registration and declaration decisions in any State.</PARA>
<PARA>This is so that there would be some consistency and transferability. The inquiry found that, to a large extent, duplication was inhibiting progress and development; it was also inhibiting initiatives. Of course, in an area which encompasses such a large part of our endeavours there will be some duplication and some petty, cross-sectional interests unable to reach a national agreement. But we felt&mdash;and I think the evidence was quite clear&mdash;that this was happening on far too many occasions and that there needed to be better coordination to resolve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry revealed other fundamental problems, and they included a lack of representation of small business and a lack of relevance of much of what industry based training was doing to small business. It also revealed a persistence with the notion that training is all that Australian workers need. Senator Carr was right to draw attention to that. The relevance of education, generic skills and also attitudinal aspects are very important because it is education on which we base the development of our ability to learn. Of course, when that is enhanced, then training becomes so much easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt at times that those participating and making decisions in these areas did not actually understand the distinction between training and education. Because of that, decisions have been made which overemphasise the mechanistic style of developing people's skills rather than enhancing people's capacity to learn and so develop their educational skills. That problem was revealed in the inquiry and, for that reason, I think it was important that the inquiry was conducted and that we take note of what was revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The politics surrounding the inquiry were to be expected. We have to take some of that with a grain of salt. I think also that we have to remember that it is an area that engenders much passion. There is nothing wrong with that, provided that, at the end of the day, we produce a document and some recommendations which are noteworthy. I think we have done that. The inquiry can only be vindicated by the reading of the entire report, including the minority report. </PARA>

<PARA>Given the enormous workload today I would like to say only a few words on this report. These public assets are of enormous value. What strikes me as particularly important in the parliamentary process is the capacity of the parliament to examine these public corporations and to provide an opportunity for parliamentary representatives to question officials from these corporations in a way that makes them publicly accountable. That is the fundamental distinguishing feature between a public asset, a public business enterprise, and a private business. The enormous private power that is associated with private corporations in the telecommunications area means that we do not have a capacity to involve them in a parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important for the Senate to be able to maintain this. Telstra and Australia Post make contributions in terms of the country's communications and technological advances&mdash;they provide enormous employment, they make a huge contribution to the public purse and they provide enormous investment because of their strategic place within the economy. For those reasons plus the issue of public accountability, it strikes me as an absolute abomination to talk of privatising these enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coming election, I welcome the opportunity to pursue that question with all the vehemence that we can muster. It is an extraordinary notion for political parties to suggest that we can cover all our financial and economic problems by saying, `We will fill whatever financial gap we have by flogging off Telstra.' It will be pathetic when the Liberals go into the election and say that they will flog off Telstra. They have not thought about how they are going to get that through the Senate. They have not thought about the political and social consequences of such an appalling act. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Land Fund Matters covered some issues that were fairly controversial. The Senate this time last year and earlier this year debated at some great length&mdash;in fact I think it was the second or third longest debate in the history of the Senate&mdash;the establishment of a land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain senators, particularly the Western Australian Greens, the coalition senators and on some issues Senator Harradine, had a range of concerns about the establishment of the land fund. In particular one of those concerns was the establishment of what has come to be known as a parallel program, and that is a system that allows a transition between the existing ATSIC land acquisition and management program and the newly formed Indigenous Land Corporation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As told to the Senate by the government and reported by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his second reading speech, that structure would allow a transition between the existing land acquisition and management programs for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the scheme established for the land fund. There were concerns raised about that parallel program from various places, not the least of which was from the Northern Territory government and the Chief Minister at that time, Marshall Perron. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the ILC was finally established with the passing of the so-called Land Fund Bill in this place earlier this year, ATSIC held a board meeting and, at that board meeting, made a decision to appropriate or apportion a significant majority&mdash;in fact, in excess of 85 per cent&mdash;of all of their land acquisition moneys into the Northern Territory for the next two years. That is something like $20 million out of a total of $24 million to be made available for purchases in the Northern Territory, virtually to the total exclusion of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders across the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette, from the WA Greens, a number of other senators and I raised concerns about this, as did indeed some of the government ministers. In fact there was a debate in this place on that. I think both Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Bob Collins expressed surprise at the decision and some concern. The Senate sought, on the motion of Senator Chamarette, to find out some of the facts pertaining to the decision made by ATSIC. We had certain documents tabled under an order of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that, or about the same time, a number of other Aboriginal organisations&mdash;specifically the New South Wales Land Council, the FAIRA organisation and the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre&mdash;challenged the decision of ATSIC on administrative grounds in the Federal Court. Of course, subsequent to that, the Federal Court found that ATSIC had erred at law and overturned the decision. Of course, the situation now is that ATSIC is reconsidering it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate chose to establish the select committee, whose report I now table, to investigate the decision-making processes leading up to that. I do not want to canvass too much of the content of the report. It is the subject of a minority report, which has been signed by Senator Kernot, Senator Childs and Senator Chris Evans, who is on leave at the moment and who has associated himself with that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report makes a number of conclusions. Firstly, just for the record, the committee found that the actions of ATSIC had been inappropriate, that they had led to discrimination against Aboriginals in other parts of Australia&mdash;and it made a number of recommendations. Initially, it recommended that, in dealing with Aboriginal land matters, there should be someone in federal government with responsibility for this area. We found, particularly with the native title legislation and the establishment of the land fund, that there were no less than five ministers, including the Prime Minister, who at some stage took some responsibility for these decisions. Clearly, no-one had any specific ministerial responsibility for that area, so we made that as one of the key recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also said that there needs to be an improvement in the public transparency and accountability of these ATSIC board decisions. One of the great concerns this committee found was that many of the Aboriginal organisations, individuals and communities found it very hard to discover exactly what the board had decided&mdash;and the committee found itself faced with the same problem on a number of occasions during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence was given to the committee by ATSIC officers and, indeed, on some occasions by the chairperson of ATSIC, Ms O'Donoghue, which would lead us to one point of view only to find out that written evidence, such as minutes of board meetings, may indeed be contradictory. Of course, we then had to go through the tedious process of trying to reconcile various bits of evidence which, on their face, seemed to involve some fundamental conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also found on this matter of transparency and accountability that some of the records of various board meetings, tapes of the crucial ATSIC board meeting and handwritten notes of a consultative meeting with the Prime Minister held in June 1994 had been lost. We found this very regrettable. Indeed, evidence was given to the committee that some of the minutes of the crucial ATSIC board meeting were incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence was also given that advice, given by ATSIC to the Indigenous Land Corporation, on crucial issues such as the percentage of money available for acquisition of land in the Northern Territory, was grossly misleading. We had to spend a lot of time trying to find out why such misleading advice had been given to the ILC on such a crucial issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final recommendation, which I think is an important one, is that the Auditor-General conduct a performance audit of the ATSIC land acquisition and maintenance program. The minority report, which I have had only a brief opportunity to read, says that this is part of some sort of an ATSIC bashing exercise.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Senate and to ATSIC: that could not be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have now had the LAMP program operating for five years. You are now in a transitionary stage between that program and the situation where, within 18 months or so, the ILC will be operating all acquisition and management programs for Aboriginal people. You can clearly see, from the process which this committee has looked into, that there are a number of issues that are of serious concern and may need some structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate&mdash;and the committee has supported this by way of recommendation&mdash;that this is an important time to find out just whether the LAMP, land acquisition and management program, administered by ATSIC, is performing, is meeting the needs of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in a fair and equitable way; and, at this stage where the ILC is just beginning to get itself established, whether or not the Auditor-General in a performance audit can make some recommendations that would indeed help the ILC in this transitionary phase. So we see this as a constructive recommendation, certainly not as a destructive one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, in the short time remaining to me, I would put on the record my thanks to my other committee members&mdash;the Deputy Chairman, Senator Chamarette; my coalition colleagues Senator Troeth and Senator Ellison; and of course the Labor and Democrat senators who were on the committee. Most importantly, on behalf of all committee members, I would like to record our thanks to Sue Morton, the committee secretary. Sue has put in an incredible effort on this committee. She is under enormous stress. She is also working on a number of other reports for other committees I am on, and so I understand her stress.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Select Committee on Certain Land Fund Matters was appointed on 31 August 1995 to report on the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in the light of the Federal Court decision of 30 August 1995 which set aside the ATSIC Board decision of March 1995 `that in all the circumstances was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could come to it', to examine the process which led to that decision</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">whether there were any other agreements between the Government, ATSIC and/or Aboriginal people arising from negotiations on the Native Title Act or the Land Fund Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC has, since its inception in 1990, administered the Land Acquisition and Maintenance Program (LAMP) which provides for the acquisition and maintenance of land for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year the Indigenous Land Corporation Amendment Act (The Land Fund Act) was passed. It established a separate land fund for the purchase of land by indigenous people, and was to be administered by a new Indigenous Land Corporation. The Land Fund was set up to accommodate those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people who could not avail themselves of Native Title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite ATSIC and the ILC both administering land fund programs, the Government decided that the ILC and ATSIC would BOTH receive funding for land acquisition and maintenance for a 2 year period, that being the years 95-96 and 96-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasons for this `transitional period' appear to have occurred because of the unique form of land title available to Aboriginal People under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act (ALRA) (N.T.). Where a claim under this Act is successful, the land is converted to unalienable freehold title, with the ability to veto any mining on the land. The land is managed by the relevant Land Council in consultation with the traditional owners and other affected Aboriginal people. As such it is regarded as a superior form of title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any claims under the ALRA, however, have an expiry date of June 1997 by which they are to be lodged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, the concern in the Northern Territory was that there would be in fact three regimes under which Aboriginal People could claim land i.e. ATSIC, ILC and ALRA (N.T.). More particularly, land granted by the ILC or ATSIC could be claimed under the ALRA and thereby converted to a superior title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to address this concern, the Government included in the Land Fund Legislation a clause prohibiting any claim under the ALRA granted by the ILC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the position with respect to the ILC was made clear, the position was not so with respect to ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Stephen Hatton (then Northern territory Minister for Aboriginal Development and Lands) in September 1994 warned that ATSIC could allocate funds for the acquisition of pastoral properties in the Territory, and that land claims over that land could then be made before the 1997 cut off date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question being asked was whether the extension of this two years was granted to enable ATSIC to use funding measures for land acquisition in the Northern Territory. This would enable additional land to be claimed in the Territory during that period, under the ALRA (NT).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This INTENTION was consistently denied by the Government and ATSIC. In particular, I asked Senator Evans the Leader of the Government in the Senate on 21st of March 1995 whether money could be devoted mainly to acquiring properties in the Northern Territory and whether that would deplete funds available to purchase a property in other parts of Australia. I asked the Minister whether the Government could give an undertaking that there would not be a heavy concentration on the acquisition of property in the Northern Territory over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister answered:  `It is not our expectation that ATSIC will do anything other than maintain the normal pattern of land acquisition using those funds available to it. . . .' the Minister went on to say `I do not believe there is any basis for thinking that the kind of strategy outlined by Senator Ellison will be pursued' and he concluded that he thought `we could rely on good sense prevailing in that respect'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Events following Senator Evan's answer are contrary to his assurances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE DECISION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A briefing paper was presented to the ATSIC board for a meeting in March 1995 and the board was to consider options for the ATSIC/LAMP program for the remaining 2 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper outlined 4 options. The preferred option was to `quarantine the entire amount allocated by ATSIC for land acquisition for the 2 transitional years for use for land in the Northern Territory'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The option to be adopted was based on underlying assumptions that there be SPECIAL TREATMENT for the Northern Territory for land acquisition from ATSIC's Land Acquisition Program, in line with DISCUSSIONS WITH GOVERNMENT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This flies in the face of Senator Evan's assurance and leads one to question what discussions were held, who in Government took part in them and who was privy to information from them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATSIC board was tied 9 all over the vote to quarantine $10 million for the Northern Territory, $2 million was to be allocated to other national purchases and $9 million for land management. Chairperson Lois O'Donoghue used her casting vote (as well as her deliberative vote) to resolve the impasse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FEDERAL COURT CHALLENGE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATSIC board's decision (in March) was challenged by the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council and the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre in June, 1995 and later by the Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action Aboriginal Corporation (FAIRA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both proceedings were heard together and on August 30th, Justice Hill found the decision by the ATSIC board in March was `an improper execution of power' and ordered the decision be set aside, as well as ordering ATSIC be restrained from making grants of money or the purchase of land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The court's finding that the board's decision was `so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could come to it' is in itself, a strong criticism of the process that enabled the board to come to that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the decision is analysed, one can readily understand why the court came to its decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the establishment of ATSIC, 14.41 per cent of land acquisition funding and 24.16 per cent of land management funding has been allocated to the Northern Territory. Northern Territory land acquisition funding therefore represents 10.05 per cent of the total acquisition and maintenance funding available. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, the funding allocated to the Territory for land acquisition by the ATSIC board decision in March for the years 95-96 and 96-97 represents 83.33 per cent of land acquisition funding and 47.62 per cent of the total land acquisition and management funding available. This is significant departure from existing position without sufficient reason being given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inequitable distribution of assistance is immediately apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AGREEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the Committee's investigations into whether there were any agreements between the Government, ATSIC and/or Aboriginal people, the Committee heard evidence that an agreement was reached in June 1994 between the Prime Minister and indigenous representatives, that ATSIC's LAMP would be extended for two years, until 1997. This coincided with the claim expiry for land under the ALRA (N.T.).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of any other agreements has been denied by a number of witnesses and not enough evidence was available to the Committee to either accept or exclude their evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing is clear and that is at a meeting between the Prime Minister and representatives of indigenous organisations on 16 June 1994 a proposal was put to Mr Keating that ATSIC be allowed to retain its land acquisition and maintenance function in ADDITION to the ILC for a two year transitional period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are now questions  as to whether at some point a `deal' was made between the Prime Minister and Aboriginal representatives to circumvent the undertaking given by the Prime Minister to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hatton's reaction to these arrangements, in evidence to the Senate's Finance and Public Administration Standing Committee was that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`funds allocated in the Northern Territory would be available to purchase properties and subsequent claims under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which is contrary to the undertakings given to our government by the Prime Minister. Thus we have argued that all the funds should be dealt with through the indigenous land fund rather than some being siphoned off into the other land fund. If one was into conspiracy theories, one could suggest that was a way of meeting an undertaking without meeting the undertaking. It certainly smacks of that as far as we are concerned. . . '</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore `does not find it probable' that there was any coincidence in the connection between the extension granted to ATSIC and the expiry of the 1997 sunset clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Les Malezer, the General Manager of FAIRA told the Committee there was a general knowledge during negotiations on the Land Fund Bill that the existence of the `sunset clause'  was taken into account in relation to the drafting of the Land Fund bill and the decision for parallel ATSIC and ILC land acquisition and maintenance programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence given to the Committee by Darryl Pearce the Director of the Northern Land Council should be noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`I actually raised the issue with the Prime Minister and put it across the table. . . '</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`. . . we are not silly or simple enough to deny that we did not recognise the benefit to us.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We are not going to deny the fact that we recognised what opportunity available to us and I am sure that most people around the table would have recognised that.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not dispute that Mr Pearce is genuine in his endeavours to get the best possible deal for his Land Council. The situation for ATSIC is another matter. ATSIC is charged with administering a land fund nationwide. As such, it should adhere to the principle of an equitable distribution of assistance across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC'S DECISION MAKING PROCESS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also received submissions and evidence which raised serious concerns about ATSIC's decision making processes, and about the transparency of its actions and accountability to all its constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are indications ATSIC did not sufficiently regard national priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some serious problems with ATSIC's record keeping procedures have emerged, and were highlighted by discrepancies in minutes presented to the Committee and the Federal Court in relation to the board meeting in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such bodies as FAIRA had to resort to FOI applications in order to find out what went on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a satisfactory state of affairs, where you have constituents of ATSIC having to go to such lengths in order to find out about decisions which vitally affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">COMMITTEE FINDINGS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the two terms of reference, the Committee found that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">at the time of negotiations, the parties did not directly admit that their agreement extended to the focussing of land purchases by ATSIC in the Northern Territory. Although this may be the case, it certainly was apparent to Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC did not fully consider the potential implication of its actions in relation to its constituents in all parts of Australia and failed to provide appropriate accountability and transparency in decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore recommended that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 be amended to provide measure to increase the transparency of ATSIC Board decisions and the accountability of the ATSIC board to indigenous people and the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having regard to the $100.0 million that ATSIC has spent on land, the Committee further recommended that the Auditor-General conduct a performance audit of the ATSIC Land Acquisition and Maintenance Program to assess whether the program is achieving its objectives.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) ATSIC failed to follow an adequate decision making process in coming to its decision as found by the Federal Court decision of 30 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that actually could have been a unanimous finding. The second point, and this would not have been unanimous, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Otherwise the process was consistent with that observed in other democratically elected bodies dealing with political issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Even that might have had majority support because there is no doubt that we have seen a degeneration of the parliamentary decision making process and other decisions that are made in very political ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that ATSIC failed to follow an adequate decision making process, the minority report goes on to conclude that they concur with the evidence of the Chairperson of ATSIC, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My view, of course, is that this is an ATSIC bashing exercise, and the sooner we get this behind us&mdash;I mean, how many more times do we have to answer the same questions before it is really dead?

<PARA>The implication there is that we are trying to undermine ATSIC by trying to look at the areas that may have been present in them coming to a decision that we believe was not reached in an adequate way.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill establishes a joint food standards system in Australia and New Zealand. It is the culmination of two year's careful and considered negotiation. It sets the pace for reform in this increasingly important sector of the economy. The new food standard system will promote trade in the food industry in both countries. It will also reduce costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Zealand is now Australia's third largest trading partner. Trans-Tasman bilateral trade in food has passed the billion dollar mark. To maintain this growth, the government is looking to go beyond the closer economic relations arrangements. It is looking to remove trade barriers by establishing a single market in food.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, food is regulated by a co-operative commonwealth, state and territory arrangement set in place in 1991. This provides for standards to be developed by the National Food Authority, a commonwealth agency. This is a process that works well. It is characterised by open and transparent consultative arrangements. It enables all groups and interests to participate to ensure Australian food standards protect public health and safety and facilitate trade in a purposeful and lasting way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority recommends standards for adoption to a Council of Health Ministers which is known as the National Food Standards Council. If food standards are adopted by the Council, they are then taken up by reference and without amendment into the food laws of the States and Territories. This system is somewhat unique in its ability to respond quickly and effectively to the health and safety needs of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, the food standard system is transparent and accountable. Public consultation, widespread public notification and parliamentary estimates processes all ensure that the food standards system is open to scrutiny and public input.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New Zealand government has recognised the success of the existing Australian food standards system. Consequently, negotiations between the two countries have resulted in a proposed joint food standards setting system, based upon the existing Australian model, to deliver joint standards in the two countries. It is an innovative and exciting outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A treaty has been negotiated. New Zealand will join the Australian system with as little disruption as possible. The obligations arising from the 1991 agreement between the states and territories will be preserved. Australia will recognise the needs of New Zealand as a sovereign nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional arrangements in the treaty address bilateral trade issues. They provide the means for the Australian food industry to secure access to the New Zealand market. The arrangements have been carefully negotiated. The Australian food industry will not be disadvantaged by them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public health and safety will remain the paramount consideration for food standards. The provision of information to consumers, the promotion of fair trade and of trade and commerce in the food industry will also be taken into account. International standards will be considered where they are consistent with the other objectives. Consumers can be confident that the protection afforded by our food standards to the Australian community and to our industry will not be lowered. Standards will continue to meet Australian needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia enjoys an international reputation for its food standards and its food standards setting system. We have been able to capture a sizeable market share on our reputation for providing high quality foods. The new food standards system supports this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All existing quarantine, hygiene and food inspection laws will continue to apply. Third countries will not be able to circumvent the rigorous systems currently in place. We will maintain our market edge as a `clean and green' food producer. Australia's international reputation in this area will be enhanced by the treaty. Our position in the region as a trading partner with New Zealand will be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for the establishment of a joint standards agency, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Authority. It will have offices and operations in both Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standards developed by the new authority will be recommended to a joint Council of Health Ministers, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. It will comprise minsters from the commonwealth, New Zealand, the states and the territories. If food standards are adopted by the Council, they will be published in both countries and be adopted by reference and without amendment into food legislation in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, this will occur through the already established mechanisms of the 1991 commonwealth, state and territory agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The food standards system allows New Zealand to opt-out of a joint standard in exceptional circumstances. New Zealand, as a sovereign nation, has a right to determine its own domestic laws. However, the opt-out provisions are strict and with tightly defined criteria. It is expected they will only be used in very rare circumstances, if at all. The New Zealand member of the Ministerial Council will be required to provide a statement of reasons setting out the exceptional circumstances that cause New Zealand to vary from the joint standard. There is a also a mechanism to review of any decision to opt-out. This matter will be kept under very close and careful scrutiny. Both Australia and New Zealand recognise that the more the opt-out provision is used, the less effective the joint food standards system will be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council will be subject to the regulation impact assessments required by principles endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments. The joint system also provides for the proposed trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement to apply to food so that the trade impact of non-uniform standards is minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Zealand will bear the costs of its participation in the Australia New Zealand food standards system, and so this bill is cost neutral to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that after almost two years of negotiations, the Australia New Zealand food standards system represents an excellent result for Australia and the Australian food industry. It should remove a number of trade access issues which have been frustrating Australian exporters. It will reduce compliance costs and provide for a larger and more secure market in processed foods. The system will ensure that closer economic relations with New Zealand remain at the cutting edge of trade policy. It provides a worthy example for similar processes of trade facilitation in the APEC region and in the wider multilateral context.</PARA>

Senator Lees's concern is that we do not move to a 50 per cent child-care assistance after 1 April 1996, that the government would be responsible for making sure a regulation was introduced to make sure the intention of the Senate was covered. </PARA>

The minister has agreed that this is where we are heading and she has agreed to give an undertaking to ensure that the correct wording is reinserted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the budget, the government announced this regressive measure which cuts the total amount of child care assistance or fee relief paid out by the government by $16 million next year. It is targeted, and this is our problem, at the people who can least afford it&mdash;the lowest income families: the lower your income the harder you will be hit by this move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one of the most regressive measures anyone could possibly dream up, hitting hardest those people the government and the coalition like to refer to as the `battlers'. The measure that is hidden away in this particular subclause&mdash;and these regulations were tabled in this place on 16 October&mdash;is the change in amounts by which fee relief or child care assistance is paid by the government to parents for allowable holiday absences from 1 April next year. These allowable absences are for up to five weeks. What the government is effectively saying is that, while you are on holidays and your child-care place is on hold, it will pay only half the amount of child-care assistance or fee relief you are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superficially that argument is certainly attractive&mdash;that is, it is not fair for a family to have to pay full fees while their place is on hold while the family is on holidays and that centres do need some sort of incentive to fill places while its usual occupants are temporarily away. The government is suggesting that only half the fee should be charged. It is acting unilaterally to cut its contribution to the fee by half for holiday periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no problem in agreeing that a holding fee could perhaps be lower than a normal fee. We have no problem saying to services, `How about trying to arrange your fee structure so that you do charge lower fees for holiday absences and slightly more for the rest of the year.' Some centres are able to do that. As we talked to centres in lower income areas, we found that this was simply not a realistic possibility. The reality is that it is not simply an encouragement to achieve that. It is not about greater fairness or lower fees; it is about government savings and, inevitably for those centres that cannot accommodate this measure, higher fees for parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government aims to save $16 million a year by the measure&mdash;by cutting its child-care assistance outlays. The money will not come from wealthy parents, but from parents who are eligible for child-care assistance&mdash;parents who, by definition, are less well off. I want to go through some specific examples so that people listening do understand how this actually works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fees are set by centres to cover a series of fixed costs. All costs over the year are taken into account. Those costs are divided by the number of places on offer over the year, including the times when some families may be taking holidays, because there is no way of knowing who will be taking how long and when. It is not a particularly mysterious process. Some parents can then get fee relief or assistance from the government to help pay whatever the fee is that that centre determines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is saying that it only wants to pay half of the fee relief and half of what the families are normally entitled to for holiday absences. What is going to happen then? The shortfall in what that centre has budgeted for will have to be made up. For those weeks a family is on holiday the centre will only get half the amount of child-care assistance they budgeted for. They may be able to absorb it. In some centres where there are very few low income families&mdash;in other words, they rely on relatively little child-care fee relief&mdash;they may be able to do that. But it is community based centres which base fees on cost recovery that we are particularly concerned about, particularly those centres in lower income areas where there is a very high percentage of parents on fee relief and full fee relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Centres' fees are generally at around break even, particularly those in the community centres. They set a rate, which private centres must compete with. There may be some room for a few private centres in areas where there is a long waiting list to absorb some of these costs, but the evidence that has been placed before us is that there are very few centres that will be fully able to absorb them and the majority of centres will be struggling. Inevitably, the cost will be passed on to the parents. The parents will pay for the government savings of $16 million and the impact will be greatest, as I said before, in those areas which have the most children eligible for child-care assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look practically at how these fees will be passed on, let us look at a couple of examples using working families who need full-time care. Assume that the centre has an average fee of $140 a week. First, let us look at a family on $62,000 a year annual income. They receive no fee relief. They can go on holidays whenever they like and have no increase in their normal fee. This does not affect them whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, let us look at a family on $35,000 a year. They get about 60 per cent of the maximum possible fee relief. Of the $140 a week that they owe, they would normally receive from the government assistance of around about $57, leaving the family to cover about $70 to $73 gap per week. This family goes on holidays for three weeks and the government says, `We are only paying half your assistance, half that we normally do&mdash;that is, $33.75 instead of $67.50 for each of those weeks.' The centre says, `You have to make up the money. Not only do you owe the normal $72.50 for the week, but an extra $33.75, which the government has declined to subsidise your fee by.' So for the three weeks that they are on holidays, that is an extra outlay of $121.25 that the family will have to find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One possibility is that the fee could be spread over the entire year, which some centres have said is another way that they are looking at doing it. If it is spread over 50 weeks, arriving at the higher average fee so the whole bill does not come at once, that would increase the family's fees by $2 a week every week. So it would be a $111 bill up-front or about a $2 a week increase for a family on $35,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the family that earns $25,000 a year. On that income the family is on full fee relief. It receives from the government the maximum child-care assistance of $112.50 per week to cover the majority of the centre's fees, leaving the family with a gap cover of about $27.50 per week.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this family goes on holidays for three weeks, the government says, `We're only paying half the assistance that we normally pay&mdash;we're only paying $56.25 instead of $112.50 for each of those weeks.' The centre says, `Sorry, we still have to charge you; where is the money?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do you owe the normal $27.50 for the week but you owe an extra $56.25 by which the government has declined to subsidise your fee. So over three weeks that is an extra $168.75 which the family will have to find&mdash;that is, $168 for a family which earns about $450 a week. I argue with the government that that is a substantial amount of money. To suggest that it is inconsequential, that we are really only talking about small amounts of money, is not correct when we look at the level of income on which families have to manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we spread this over the entire year, we would be looking at increasing the family's fees by about $3.40 per week, every week. So, as far as this measure is concerned, the poorer you are, the harder you are hit. On $62,000, there is no impact; on $35,000, it is $101 a year; on $25,000, it is $168 a year&mdash;and that is with three weeks holidays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have more children and the bill becomes more complicated. For example, if you are on maximum fee relief&mdash;that is, an income of about $25,000&mdash;and you have two children in care, when you take holidays your bill, under this measure, will increase by about $103 a week for each week you are on holidays; that is, for three weeks holiday, $309 or, spread over the weeks, $66.20 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone is writing a dictionary and wants a definition of the word `regressive', I do not think we could find a better way of describing it than by looking at this measure. It certainly would be a perfect definition of `regressive'. You can put this through as many different scenarios as you like but it is $16 million out of the pockets of those who can least afford it. Centres in affluent areas across our cities and in our affluent rural areas where very few children get fee relief will be virtually unaffected by this measure. It is those centres in, for example, the western suburbs of Sydney and the northern and southern suburbs of my home city that will be worst affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say to you, minister: find somewhere else to make your savings. That is also before pointing out what a financial and administrative nightmare this could well be for centres. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, by disallowing paragraph (5)(c)(ii) of guideline No. 18, we will see the status quo remain and we will leave the government to look elsewhere for these savings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perspective is all. I find this argument by Senator Lees a really very interesting argument. It is actually contrary to a lot of the facts and it is certainly contrary to a lot of practice. I would like to take senators through what is the situation and why the government's intention to do this is one of the matters that we put through in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The savings for the government are $37 million over four years, so it is no small sum. Also, the Australian Law Reform Commission, when it did a thorough examination of child care about a year ago, highlighted the fact of an inequity between family day care, where they have always only had 50 per cent child-care assistance for holidays, and long day care centres, where they have been eligible for 100 per cent. As a matter of fairness and equity between the two sectors, it made the point that we should take note of this enormous discrepancy. That is another very persuasive reason why we should be moving to 50 per cent child-care assistance for holidays across all centres. You could well ask why families who have got comparable sorts of fees in family day care have 50 per cent child-care assistance for vacation care absences while people in long day care centres do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next important point is that the charging practices of centres are the charging practices of centres; they are not a government responsibility. Senator Lees, I am sometimes enormously tempted to think about the benefits I could introduce into child care if I were setting fees, but we don't have that power and, I must say, on the whole, we don't want it. But we certainly have to deal with the confusion in the community when child-care assistance, which is to assist with the fees and to offset them, if you like, to provide fee relief, is a government responsibility but the setting of the fees that centres charge is entirely the centres' responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees gave some examples of how centres can decide to take into account their costs and spread them over a year taking into account the needs of people for holidays and so on, and others who set a fee for when a child is there and keep charging it through the holidays. We have to also note that centres have been a bit slow to modify their charging practices. The changes to their charging practices have been initiated by government changes in child-care assistance, which is perhaps not the very best way of dealing with things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will remember that a little while ago many of the centres were discovered to be charging full fees and getting full child-care assistance for children who attended only two days a week. The industry as well as the government agreed that that practice had to stop, and it has stopped. It has made a difference to centres. It could be that no more children are going to the centres, but their charging practices have changed. If our child-care assistance contribution can assist centres in thinking about their fee setting processes, then I think that is a very good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first important point I have to say is that this is a budget measure with savings of $37 million over four years. The second important point is that it is a matter of equity. It was drawn to our attention by the Law Reform Commission that there was an inequity between family day care where there is 50 per cent child-care assistance for holidays and long day care where there is not that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I have to say, Senator Lees, is that we have given under allowable absences up to five weeks holidays, but we also have that buffer of 12 days for unseen circumstances. They will not change. They will still enjoy 100 per cent child-care assistance, as will absences due to sickness. It is fairly true that, for a large number of people using child care, they can anticipate when they will be taking holidays and the centres have the opportunity to provide those places to other parents who are desperate for access to child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, we have the need and demand for vacation care. There are many families who may be able to get before and after school hour care during the school term, but do not have access to vacation care. The long day care centres could use those places for vacation care. It is designed for the children. It would be a splendid set up. They would get the child-care assistance for it. It would encourage the centres to market themselves, if you like, to a slightly wider community and get them income for their centre to keep it viable. It would also meet the very significant needs, particularly for vacation care, of the safe secure sort that families want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the evidence, something like 153,000 children would be very pleased to have casual occasional care; that is, people who do not want regular occasional care, but certainly are looking for casual occasional care. They would be on a list as saying, `Yes, please. We would be happy to use casual occasional care if it becomes available.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again we are asking centres to introduce that kind of flexibility because the vacation care is usually five weeks as a chunk. They can see that opportunity coming and could let some of the families who are desperate for child care in a casual or not in an ongoing way to fill those places. So we would be asking centres to appreciate the opportunities they have for extending the families who could use their child care, and I highlight in particular vacation care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other facts that need to be put into your equation, Senator Lees. I do not wish to split hairs, but the maximum child-care assistance is about $96. The figure of $112.50 is what the fee is set at and then families have to pay the $16.50. So I think you would find the maximum assistance is $96. It doesn't make too much difference to the equation you gave at all. I just draw that to your attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all centres choose to force parents to pay full fees for holiday absences. The majority of both private and community based centres in Tasmania charge only 50 per cent holiday fees for holidays. In Queensland, the majority of community based centres charge 50 per cent holding fees for holidays. Even now they have set their charges at half rate for holidays. I am very pleased that they do it. I certainly encourage it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cases Senator Lees illustrates are really outrageous. I have no truck at all for parents having to pay more for child care when their children are not there than when they are using it. That is absolutely daft. I do not believe it is solved by leaving the 100 per cent child-care assistance there. It is solved by asking the child-care centres to drop their fees to correspond with the reduced child-care assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take issue with your claim that families who pay full fees and get no child-care assistance are not affected because their fee remains the same. I can assure you that is not what parents write to me. They ask why they should continue to pay $140 week when their child is not using the centre. Parents understand there may be a case for some kind of fee to contribute to the cost and to make sure their place is there when they come back after five weeks, but why should they pay the same amount for child care when they are not using the centre? It is absolutely daft. I have all the sympathy in the world for people who find they pay more for child care when they are not using it. That is really crazy. It is not an issue of sheeting that home to the government; it is an issue of sheeting that home to the charging practices of centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Lees that right now the majority of both private and community based centres in Tasmania charge only 50 per cent holding fees for holidays. In Queensland, the majority of community based centres charge 50 per cent holding fees. So already a lot of centres have recognised that it is daft to be charging the same rate when parents are not using child care. I think these are enlightened charging practices, but they are not consistent across the whole sector. I would certainly like to see the remainder of child care centres, both community based and long day care, take note of what is already happening in some parts and move to doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in family day care is quite different. The provision of 50 per cent entitlement to child-care assistance for holiday absences is the standard practice in family day care. As I have already said, the Australian Law Reform Commission, in its 1994 review, drew this to our attention. It is important to note that in family day care only five per cent of schemes charge the full fees for holiday absences&mdash;I certainly think it is about time I knew which ones&mdash;and 95 per cent of schemes charge half the full fee or less for holiday absences. I think that is absolutely appropriate and absolutely something we should be encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a recognisable 50 per cent child-care assistance consistent across the sectors will encourage that kind of rational charging practice across the whole of the long day care sector, I would have to support it. People who are paying more for child care when they are not using it have a very large right to complain bitterly, but I think it is important that they do not sheet that responsibility home to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family day care scheme 50 per cent reduction is certainly very good evidence that, if you have a 50 per cent child-care assistance for holidays, you get a remarkable 50 per cent reduction of fees for the holiday period. As I have pointed out, there is an opportunity for families to look for vacation care. A lot of the people taking holidays from child care will be taking a four- or five-week block, as they are allowed to. When people have other children they often want that block to correspond to school holidays. Those holidays can be anticipated by the centre. They can offer those places to others looking for vacation care because they do not have the same opportunity for holidays. It will require perhaps a different bit of effort by child-care centres, but it is the sort of thing that families will appreciate enormously. It will help them during the period when they might be looking at a drop in income because of a slightly reduced holding fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not persuaded by your argument, Senator Lees. You can make the case, as you do, on the figures. Those figures are in large part right, but they depend on the charging practices. The government dropping its child-care assistance is not promoting regressivity. It is promoting fair charging practices by centres. As I say, I do not think people, whether they have full fee relief or none at all, are encouraged by a process that makes them pay more when their children are away from child care than when they are in it. People who get no child-care assistance would not be encouraged by a process which maintains very expensive fees that they would have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also find it difficult to reconcile Senator Lees's argument that we should maintain 100 percent child-care assistance at centres when people are on holidays, taking their allowable absence for holidays, and yet see a significant campaign to oppose the 12-hour legislation that would allow more opportunity for more families wanting particularly occasional care. Of course, if those places currently used by occasional care were modified, then, of course, many more working families would have access to child care, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all ways, while I understand exactly the sentiment behind Senator Lees's proposal in moving this disallowance motion, I am not at all persuaded by the argument because the regressivity disappears very significantly if the fees match the child-care assistance, instead of the child-care assistance being maintained at a high level just to keep those fees up. To do that will not result in a situation of equity. It certainly will not produce any savings, and it certainly will not encourage those centres to rethink their charging practices or their recruiting practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know there are families that would love vacation care. We know there are families that would enjoy the occasional and casual care that those places would provide. We know most holidays come in blocks of three or four or five weeks and we know that they can be anticipated and planned for. As parents plan for them, so they can notify the child-care cares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is an excellent case to oppose this disallowance motion, to make sure that the child-care assistance is fair across the sectors, and to encourage the practice of reducing the fees during holidays, as is already happening in significant parts of the child-care industry, apart from family day care. I urge senators to oppose this disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will admit that the coalition have a certain unease about this measure, as with the other budget measures that were proposed for the child-care industry as of last May. We certainly have heard from the child-care industry that there has been a lack of consultation about these measures and I would like to place on record that the coalition have criticised these measures in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, the coalition will be opposing the disallowance of this measure and would like to briefly run through the reasons why we are doing that. I do not agree with Senator Crowley, firstly, that cost is the most important issue here. Cost, to be honest, should never be an issue when looking at the child-care field. The care of children and the ultimate welfare of the family should be the most important issue. The coalition considers that, in comparison with the 12-hour issue, which was another budget measure and which we have debated here at length in the Senate, that issue has far more impact on families over the whole year with regard to their access to child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Crowley&mdash;amazingly enough, Senator Crowley&mdash;that vacation care under the existing government measure would then be available for others, as would occasional care in the sense of casual care. One would like to think that that is something that would be available for all parents throughout Australia, if and when they desire it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I take your point about the existing inequity between long day care centres and family day care centres. In the interests of looking at, I would hope, one day a much more integrated approach between every sector of the child-care industry&mdash;and I am talking here not just about family day care and long day care, but also about pre-school centres&mdash;we would like to think that some of these inequities could be ironed out. As I said, we would like to distinguish it from the 12-hour rule, which is being looked at at the moment, because that is another issue. I do believe that centres may be able to absorb this extra cost and that, if spread over the year and parents can plan for it, there may not be as much of a financial impact as Senator Lees has indicated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to respond to a couple of things that the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) said in relation to the Law Reform Commission's report. It talked about aligning payments. Obviously, you can do that either way. I take your point that family day care can adapt far more easily to holidays because, to begin with, they have fewer children. It is often very convenient for them to close down or to make other arrangements during those periods, in some cases combining various family day care groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with Senator Troeth's point that what we really need in the child-care area is full integrated planning of all services available at local government, state government and federal government levels. The fact that we have this disallowance motion before us today is indicative of the government's method of planning which is to pick out particular measures that they hope will save money at budget time and not look at the overall planning in the particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that it is far more difficult for centres that have 30, 40 or more children to simply make other arrangements during holidays. As you have said, some are able to offer half fees. I think if we look at the suburbs and locations of those centres we would find that they are far more affluent than the centres that I am concerned about. Some areas simply may not be able to attract significant numbers of children for vocational or holiday care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take Senator Troeth's point about the 12-hour rule, which is still rumbling around, a step further. How would the 12-hour rule impact on this situation? If we are looking at the situation at holiday time we could find that a mum could have three children home from school plus a younger child at home. If the 12-hour rule is in place she may not be able to take up vocational care for more than 12 hours a week. That will not help the child-care centres with their dilemma of how they are going to make up the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats stand by the motion. We believe that this is one of the most regressive moves the government could have made to find money. The minister seems to be suggesting that centres will not be encouraged to find other children or advertise. You have undone that argument by giving examples of those centres that are already doing this. I argue that many centres are trying to fill these places. If they do then they are able to offer the long-term parents reduced fees. Those parents will then claim less fee relief. I stress again that we are concerned about those centres in working class areas, those centres that are not in affluent suburbs where parents can simply absorb a few more dollars a week on their child-care bill. I am very disappointed to note that we will not have the numbers in the chamber to pass this disallowance motion. </PARA>

In the interim, limited copies of the executive summaries to the report are available on request from the committee secretariat. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opening of the third runway at Sydney airport and the closure of the east-west runway have shattered the lives of thousands of Sydney residents. The Senate established this committee on 8 March 1995 to investigate the noise burden generated by the government's Sydney airport policy and to explore possible solutions to the problem. The committee received more than 5,200 submissions and held 14 days of public hearings between July and November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning, the EIS process was marked by ambiguity and confusion. The federal government decided to build the third runway in 1989 `subject to the satisfactory completion of normal EIS processes'. However, this decision was communicated to the Federal Airports Corporation as a decision to construct the runway `subject to it meeting stringent guidelines to be established through an EIS'. In other words, the Federal Airports Corporation believed the EIS was intended to minimise the environmental impact. The decision to build the runway had already been taken by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made a number of recommendations concerning the environmental impact assessment process. In future, the government should clearly establish whether it is conducting an EIS to decide whether a project should go ahead or conducting an EIS to work out the best way of managing the impact of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many parts of the EIS were prepared to a very high standard. However, some of its key predictions were wrong, and at least one of them was demonstrated to be wrong at the time. The environmental impact statement predicted that prevailing winds would mean that aircraft would take off to the north only 13 per cent of the time. The actual figure over the past 10 years has been more than double the EIS prediction. This raises serious doubts about many of the noise impact forecasts in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aircraft noise is measured by the Australian noise exposure forecast, ANEF, system. The committee has concluded that the ANEF system has serious limitations. It may be adequate for land use planning purposes, but it is not adequate for assessing the effects of changes in noise exposure. We have therefore recommended that the National Acoustic Laboratories thoroughly redraft the ANEF system in the light of the problems that have emerged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has implemented a number of operational measures in an effort to minimise the impact of the noise generated by the airport. The committee has concluded that these measures have only marginally been effective. The Australian International Pilots Association has described them as `bandaid fixes'. The Sydney airport noise issue is a problem that requires more than bandaids or Dettol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes the noise generated by the airport should be spread equitably. This goal can only be achieved if Airservices Australia can use all three runways at the airport. That means reopening the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has repeatedly rejected using the east-west runway more extensively on safety grounds. Independent advice to the committee suggests that the dependent use of intersecting runways is not only a safe operation but a common one. The American consultancy, Flight Transportation Associates, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incidents and accidents have occurred at airports with single runways, parallel runways and crossing/intersecting runways. No one configuration has been declared to present a higher level of risk than another. No one configuration has been identified as presenting an unacceptable level of risk.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's claims about safety implications for using intersecting runways are a recent innovation. Neither the draft EIS nor the EIS supplement mentions safety as a reason for not using the east-west runway in conjunction with parallel runways. Nor was safety a concern during cabinet's evaluation of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has argued that increasing the use of the east-west runway would reduce capacity.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average movement rate on the parallel runway system is 58 movements per hour. This is comparable to the average movement rate that was achieved before the third runway was opened. Airservices Australia believes it will eventually be able to achieve 80 movements per hour. The committee considered a range of alternative runway configurations and concluded that the increasing use of the east-west runway need not reduce the airport's capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has therefore recommended the development of a new airspace management plan for Sydney airport. The new airspace management plan should examine the best means of using all three runways at the airport to balance safety, capacity and the equitable distribution of noise. The committee does not believe simops needs to be introduced at Sydney airport for capacity reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards remedial measures, the government is currently implementing an acquisition and insulation scheme in the suburbs to the north of Sydney airport. Our most important recommendation in this area relates to the scope of the insulation scheme. At the moment it is restricted to the 4,200 homes within the 30 ANEF contour. The committee agrees with the final noise management plan that was prepared for the government last year. That plan recommended that the insulation scheme should be extended to the 25 ANEF contour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards a second airport, the government has portrayed the development of Sydney West airport as an immediate solution to the Sydney airport noise problem, but the airport will handle only a small number of passengers and aircraft at first. There is still an urgent need to address the airport's infrastructure requirements, particularly the development of an airport rail link. The government is currently revising the environmental impact statement for Sydney West airport. The process must be open and transparent to maintain public confidence. It is essential that the government and its consultants do not make the same mistakes that were made in the Sydney environmental impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the existing mode of operations at Sydney airport can be described only as an environmental and social tragedy. The noise problems generated by the airport under the current mode of operations will not go away. It is the view of the majority of the committee that it can only get worse. I would like to thank all members of the committee for the dignified way in which the proceedings were conducted. On behalf of the committee, I would also like to express our thanks to the committee secretary, James Warmenhoven, and the staff who did a magnificent job in sifting through the thousands of submissions and compiling the final report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor members of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise&mdash;Senator Neal, Senator Childs and myself&mdash;have presented a minority report. I say at the outset that we are somewhat disappointed at the outcome of this inquiry; disappointed because it could have been a much more worthwhile inquiry. However, it was politicised from the start. It was politicised by the opposition even before the first hearings commenced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer, the chairman of the committee, gave a notice of a motion in the Senate on 6 March in which he called for the reopening of the east-west runway and for the reintroduction of cross-runway operations at Kingsford Smith airport. The Senate select committee was set up on 8 March 1995. So from the outset there was a pre-determined view by the opposition which became a campaign by the opposition&mdash;both by the opposition members of the committee and in particular by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard&mdash;with the single objective of having the east-west runway reopened to cross-runway operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context a lot of other issues, such as Sydney West airport, were not in our view dealt with as adequately as they could have been. Therefore we believe particularly that the majority report leaves a lot to be desired in terms of endeavouring to cover the issues and is wrong in a number of key respects. I want to deal firstly with the east-west runway issue. As I said, this became the single cause celebre of the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, appeared before the inquiry on 25 July. He said that day that, as the honourable member for Bennelong, he called for the reopening of the runway. From thereon he campaigned at every opportunity on that issue. He nobbled his own inquiry and his own opposition senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this inquiry was political was very disappointing, because there were over 5,000 submissions from interested and affected residents as well as industry, councils, medical practitioners, unions, community groups, schools, churches, government departments, academics and many others. They came along, gave their evidence, put forward proposals and believed that something more positive might come out of the inquiry. But, with it always being directed back to this single issue of the east-west runway, I think one can feel disappointed with its outcome. I would say also, however, that the information compiled and presented to the committee will continue to be valuable in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minority report we have detailed the long history of support given by the opposition to the building of the third runway. We have done that because during this committee inquiry what we saw was an attempt by the opposition to run as far away from the issue as they could in an endeavour to absolve themselves of any responsibility in connection with the construction of the third runway at Sydney airport and the resulting problems of aircraft noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history that we have detailed notes that time and time again the opposition spokespersons urged the government to build a third runway. The issues that they used in urging that the runway be built were congestion and safety at Sydney airport&mdash;they put safety fairly and squarely on the agenda. They also recognised that, in the decision to build the runway, safety would be improved, and the number of residents affected by aircraft noise would be reduced drastically by half, by the concurrent downgrading of the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They cannot deny that. It was there from the outset. It was a pre-eminent factor in the EIS deliberations that the east-west runway would be downgraded. But they now try to rewrite history and do so only in a desperate attempt to garner support from people who may be affected by aircraft noise. To them it is a pre-election issue, a pre-election stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer says that independent expert advice was given on safety, and he quotes Flight Transportation Associates. That organisation, a US firm of consultants, did not give evidence to the committee at all. Rather, a letter, a submission was presented to the committee on its behalf. At no stage were its representatives cross-examined, nor was there any opportunity for the committee to test its proposals in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But against that, we had expert evidence from the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, from Airservices Australia, from the airlines and from the air traffic controllers&mdash;all saying that parallel runways were safer. Nevertheless, the opposition tried to distort the evidence of those groups by saying that they were arguing that cross-runways were unsafe. They never said that. What they said was that parallel runways were safer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence is clear that the reintroduction of the east-west runway, as proposed, would either reduce capacity, thus creating pressure to introduce take-offs to the north from the third runway; or it would reduce safety; or it would increase noise for residents to the north&mdash;or, indeed, a combination of those. We have come to the conclusion that we cannot support the reopening of the east-west runway on the various grounds and reasons that were put forward, because at the end of the day the expert advice we had was that the system we have is safer and more efficient&mdash;and government should not ignore the advice of such agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quickly turn to the EIS process. We agree that it left a lot to be desired. In fact, it could be described in many ways, particularly with regard to community consultation, as abysmal. We are quite clear in our view that the Federal Airports Corporation and other agencies failed in their duty to provide the community with correct advice. Indeed, it is clear that many were misled into thinking that their situation would be improved&mdash;but, as we know, it got worse. We have made some very strong recommendations as part of what we call a public interest package to ensure that that does not occur again. </PARA>

The Democrats indicated they had had some troubles, not with the substance of the bill but because they wanted to satisfy themselves with respect to the guidelines that would be made under the bill. I understand they have now had the opportunity to see at least the draft of those guidelines and believe that, by and large, their concerns are going to be catered for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asked to put this on the record. On 6 March 1995 Senator Margetts proposed an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to enable married students to be eligible for qualifying for the higher independent rate of Austudy payment by virtue of marriage. The amendment proposed would operate to exempt this practice from those provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 which make it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of marital status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 March 1995 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission granted a temporary administrative exemption from the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act for the provision of benefits under the Austudy scheme until 31 December 1996. The Green's amendment is therefore unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission is presently coordinating a review into discriminatory provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. This review is required by section 40A of the Sex Discrimination Act. This factor was taken into account by the commission when it granted the Austudy exemption. The commission also noted that, because of linkages between social security benefits and Austudy benefits, it would be sensible to examine and amend the two sets of benefits in conjunction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Employment, Education and Training, which administers Austudy, is to establish a working group to consider Austudy benefits. The establishment of the working group has been delayed, pending progress of the social security review. The department has advised that the working group will be established in early 1996 to consider criteria for independent status which are non-discriminatory in terms of the Sex Discrimination Act but which reflect the community's views on who should receive benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill before the Senate will introduce amendments to five existing bills dealing with prudential controls over superannuation, the resolution of superannuation complaints issues, taxation, general insurance and life assurance. Following the passage of this legislation, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will now be in a position to hear disability cases. The original date was set at 1 November 1995. I think honourable senators will be aware of the long debates that we had in relation to the tribunal's capacity to hear medical issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following today's amendments, the tribunal will also be able to handle complaints about the sale of life company superannuation products. The amended bill also provides mechanisms to overcome the High Court's Brandy ruling which involved `judicial decision'. The amendment bill now also binds insurers so that life companies can no longer opt out of their obligations in terms of disability and death insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are important provisions for auditors, who will now have to certify that a fund complies with the prudential rules for superannuation funds set out in the act and regulations and not merely provide financial audit reports. It was disappointing that a number of auditors decided to segment audit responsibilities into categories of financial audit, compliance audit and prudential audit and charge a fee for each. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was always intended that auditors&mdash;not every auditor is able to audit a superannuation fund&mdash;had to provide not only a financial audit, but that within that audit there had to be compliance verification. That responsibility is now clarified under this bill. Auditors will also have to report suspected breaches of the law to the ISC and effectively become whistleblowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the prudential amendments to the ISC give the ISC power to quickly apply to the court for the appointment of a receiver to protect members as well as providing broader inquiry powers to the ISC. There is also the closing of a loophole regarding the payment of surplus to employer sponsored funds. I would also like to draw the Senate's attention to a UK white paper on superannuation that deals with surplus. I think we have something to learn from the UK approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a number of temporary decisions which are known as modification orders made by the ISC which will now rightly be transferred into SIS legislation before they lapse. I quote one of them: excluded funds are not to be classified as public offer funds, otherwise they would need a $5 million capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broadening of the powers of the legislation give the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal the opportunity to consider complaints about the conduct of the sale of life office intermediaries in relation to superannuation products. This includes agent misrepresentation. There is also a further widening of the powers of the ISC and these extend to the conduct of independent financial planners. This is a major departure from corporation law, which makes security dealers rather than product providers responsible for investment advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the bill has four purposes: to expand the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal; the transfer of certain modification orders with interstatutory form; the audit requirement of superannuation entities to cover compliance; and a number of miscellaneous amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the heading of `miscellaneous amendments' is the creation of a deputy chairperson and two part-time members of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. These are estimated to cost $270,000. Coming on board we will see specialist staff&mdash;for example, a medical practitioner. This is a desirable move, seeing that the tribunal will now deal with medical issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, I remind the Senate, is in the final throes of producing report No. 18, which will examine the first 12 months of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The tribunal was set up to improve the efficiency of superannuation and to provide a low cost, informal and expeditious means of resolving disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was never intended that the tribunal was to be a final point of appeal since the agreed parties always have resort to the law, which means access through the ordinary court mechanisms. However, what is not generally understood by many about the tribunal's powers is that, provided the trustees have followed the due processes, applied the laws accurately and fairly and given written reasons for their decision, the tribunal must affirm the trustees' decision. I remind honourable senators that this provision is in the original SIS legislation, but it needs to be repeated. Drawing attention to this provision should refute a lot of wild claims which were made earlier that the tribunal would be inundated with work that it is unable to handle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that superannuation and retirement incomes appear to be high on the political agenda for the forthcoming election. For example, there are the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about certain investment managers being lemons. The Prime Minister's comments are unfortunate and they do not create confidence about the industry. There is also the recent appointment of an additional minister in selling the virtues of superannuation. Thirdly, there is the slant of the educational campaign involving the money tree. These education moneys could be much better directed. In the situation of the highly emotional atmosphere of an election, pledges can be given which are not necessarily in the best long-term interest of the superannuation industry or its members. I appeal to all parties to keep their cool and to try to keep retirement incomes and superannuation on a bipartisan basis, if possible, in the interests of long-term superannuation and not use it as a vehicle to attract votes to win elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main criticism that people have with superannuation is that the government has used superannuation to collect a lot of additional taxation revenue currently collecting over $1 1/2 billion. The speed and frequency of superannuation changes, of course, has left a lot of people bewildered, even those people with expertise within the industry. There is also a need for time for consolidation. However, there are still legislative gaps to be filled. It is therefore useful to use this occasion to dwell on about five problem areas that the government needs to address in relation to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, people with intermittent work histories, particularly women. I draw the attention of the Senate to report No. 17 of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which deals with people who have broken work force patterns. I recommend that senators read the report. Also, we are expecting too much of superannuation in attempting to solve problems which are outside the jurisdiction of superannuation. Therefore, there needs to be tax concessional savings vehicles outside superannuation to provide a greater degree of flexibility and to enable draw downs for particular needs such as future education, housing, finance and sickness. The trustee nature of superannuation is an important measure and, apart from the smaller funds, the requirements for 50 per cent representation from the employer and from the employee represent some of the best features of industrial democracy. Trustees have now come to the realisation that they must take off their particular hats from employer representation or employee representation, and apply their minds to promote the best interests of the fund members in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second need is the need for comparative member statistics. A recent valuable regulation is the requirement that information and financial statements should include a five-year compound average rate of investment return, together with the yearly rate of return over the same period of the fund. In addition to this, I believe it is necessary to add a new regulation which will require comparison with what is known as an industry average, because we do not want people to get locked into poorly performing funds. Such a regulation would require further changes to transfer protocols and further extension of capital gains exemptions and similar mechanisms to allow amalgamation for poorly performing funds or funds which have got into difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue which needs to be addressed concerns a practice within the industry which is known as short selling. I believe this activity is an illegal practice and should be looked at closely, because there are several players who indulge in this practice. There is a possible exception where short selling is permitted and that is in the area of what is known by the technical term `put options'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth issue concerns accounting standard AAS25 issued by the accounting profession, whereby superannuation funds are required to report and allocate interest on a current market basis. This measure acts to prevent funds adopting appropriate long-term buy and hold strategies&mdash;for example, in infrastructure, products and bonds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth issue concerns a duplication and confusion in the regulatory regimes&mdash;for example, the regulation of superannuation funds where members' benefits are provided and defined by life insurance policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, trustees of such funds must abide by two sets of rules for the purpose of disclosure to prospective members and standard employer sponsors. A standard employer sponsor is an employer that has elected to provide superannuation benefits for its employees under a contractual arrangement with a superannuation fund trustee. There are two sets of rules: firstly, SIS regulations plus circulars and determinations issued by the Deputy Commissioner Superannuation and, secondly, circulars issued by the Deputy Commissioner Life Insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latter case, there are two further different requirements depending on whether the policies are single or regular premium based. The difference under the circulars issued by the Life Insurance Commissioner lies in the way in which the effect of the changes has to be disclosed to the members such that, in respect of regular premium policies which have initial expenses which cause a policy to have little or no value in the early years of existence, companies are required to provide a number of tables to show what one can expect to get back through the life of the policy if particular assumptions are borne out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is required is that there should be sufficient disclosure for a member to understand the impact of costs on his or her benefit, but if one's benefit is likely to be in the short-term, and the long-term is important, it is important that those benefit illustrations should apply whether one's contributions are of a single premium nature or a regular premium nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is further confusing in the life industry is that although the Life Insurance Circulars are directed at life insurers for the purpose of providing adequate disclosure protection to prospective policy owners, the SIS has specific provisions which will require trustees to provide members with sufficient information to be able to understand the impact of the charges on their particular benefits. The ISC seems to have decided that, besides SIS, the provisions of the LIC also need to apply to trustees which administer funds of life assurance policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth issue that requires attention has arisen as a result of the demise of the Excelsior Managed Superannuation Plan. Unless tax bill No. 2 is passed before the Senate rises, there will be a problem regarding reassessment of deductibility amounts of the pre-1 July 1994 element of allocated pensions. There are also potential capital gains consequences of Excelsior transfers that are made as a consequence of the asset securities passing to another fund, whether through redemption or specie transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A difficulty arises with the involuntary transfer of a superannuation benefit, whether an allocated pension or a pre-retirement accumulation, from one superannuation fund to another. The way to overcome these inherent problems is to provide amendments to the legislation which enable the transfer to be on a `trustee to trustee' basis rather than through withdrawal and re-entry mechanisms. Unfortunately, there will always be instances where funds fail, or get into difficulties, and where investment moneys have to be transferred from one fund to another. I repeat: the changes required are to make the transfers on a trustee to trustee basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh need measure is that when a superannuation fund is first set up the regulations provide that it must become a regulated fund within seven days&mdash;and there are no exceptions. This time frame is absolutely too tight. What is required is a situation where that period is extended to 30 days for the trustees to apply to have the fund deemed a regulated fund. Further, there needs to be a discretion available to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to allow additional time for exceptional cases or situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague from the other house, the honourable member for Bradfield, David Connolly, currently the shadow minister for superannuation and retirement incomes, on his successful lower house amendment which was accepted by the government and is now part of the bill in the Senate today. I congratulate him on his initiative and success in getting that amendment through. On four occasions similar measures have been put in both houses&mdash;twice in the House of Representatives and twice in the Senate. The issue I refer to is the removal of compulsory retirement at 65 years of age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, particularly in relation to the issue of disability claims in which I have had a great interest. In some ways, the whole initiative for the legislation arose because of a disallowance to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal which I moved some long time ago and which prompted  a very good response from the government. In relation to that, I would like to reiterate an interjection I tried to make during Senator Watson's speech, because I want to underline that it was multi-party support rather than bipartisan support which brought this legislation about. It is very good when we get multi-party support for legislation like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the government, particularly the government staff who are here today and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Hon. Paul Elliott, because of the way in which they responded. We did have some complaints about the time but certainly no complaints about the availability and helpfulness which was provided to us, certainly to me, in regard to these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would like to put on the record is that, although we certainly support and do not want to hold up this legislation in any way, we were made aware of just a few problems even with this legislation. I guess that there is no legislation that could ever be passed that would not have some points about it that one would want to raise, but these points were raised with us by a coalition of groups. Perhaps I could mention them: the Consumers Federation of Australia, the Consumer Credit Legal Service New South Wales Inc., the Consumer Credit Legal Service Victoria, Maurice Blackburn and Co. and the Superannuation Consumer Coalition. While they, too, do not want any delay in the legislation, because they certainly see the benefit of it, they are just wanting to signal a few problems which could occur as unforeseen consequences of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth putting these on the record, and my appeal to the government would be that it take these on board. I am sure that, over the coming months as we monitor the performance of the tribunal in relation to these amendments, we could keep our eyes on the issues that are raised and there could be a subsequent response from the government if they do prove to be problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are some of the issues which have been raised. A major concern is with the restriction on access to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal for people with disability claims in relation to some issues. They are that these people are usually particularly disadvantaged and having to cope with the stresses of a change in their quality of life. Under the draft subsection 14(6B), the tribunal will be unable to hear a complaint unless the claim was lodged with the trustee within a year of the person ceasing employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some problems with this restriction. In some cases, the medical condition may not completely manifest itself within the one-year period, or the doctor may not make an assessment that the person is totally and permanently disabled within that one-year period. These people will have the time limit elapse before they are actually able to claim. There is also, on the other side of that, the potential for members to clog the system by making claims within the one-year period when they may not yet be diagnosed in order to preserve their entitlement to subsequently proceed to the superannuation tribunal. I am sure the government can take that on board and monitor that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is that there is a low level of community awareness amongst fund members of their entitlement to claim TPD benefits under superannuation schemes. The Superannuation (Industry Supervision) Act 1993 does not require trustees to give notice to fund members of their entitlement to TPD claims on leaving the fund. So it is possible that the current amendments could actually create an incentive for trustees&mdash;and I am not suggesting they would do this, but one never knows&mdash;not to make members aware of their potential entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Watson interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is just what I was going to refer to, Senator Watson, thank you. That is a good comment. At the very least, if the one-year period is to remain, there should be a government commitment to educating individuals as to their entitlements, which is exactly what Senator Watson is saying. I think that was a very good interjection. There should be a proviso enabling a claim to be taken to the tribunal where the failure to lodge the claim was due to the actions of the trustees. I do not want to infer that trustees might do this but, unfortunately, I have had at least one example of a constituent of mine, on whose behalf I acted, where the trustees were obstructionist in terms of this person pursuing their claim. It was settled in the end but the trustees could have been a lot more helpful. So we are signalling that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restriction could limit access to a low-cost forum, therefore, for a group who have a pronounced need for it. Access to justice is an ideal to be lauded and promoted. I understand that there are a large number of clients who could now be forced to litigate their claims in the courts at greater expense and cost to all parties if some of the things that I have signalled eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is the concern with respect to the question of the interpretation of sections 14 and proposed section 14A of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. It is unclear yet how these two sections will interact. There is a possibility that the tribunal will interpret these sections in such a way that some complaints currently before the tribunal in respect of the sale of life insurance products under section 14 will be excluded because they do not fall within the new regime for the handling of complaints for the sales of life office products, which will only apply from the date of royal assent. I appreciate that the intention of the legislation is not to exclude these complaints but, should the tribunal take such a restrictive interpretation, these people will be left in a parlous position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no intention, of course&mdash;I certainly would resist any thought&mdash;that any of these issues should be raised in a way which obstructs the passage of this legislation, but my appeal to the government is that, in monitoring the legislation, it takes these issues on board, which, if the problems which I have outlined do arise, will enable us to attempt to correct them. My intention is that the tribunal will operate effectively, especially on the part of those who do not have the resources to go into expensive litigation in order to obtain justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will ensure that, when all other avenues fail, people have access to a low-cost independent tribunal in order to progress their search for justice. I commend to the government the questions which have been raised with me and, I have no doubt, with other people. I am sure that other people in this place have received the same letter. I am very happy to indicate that the Democrats heartily support this legislation. </PARA>

The Christmas-New Year period is coming upon us quickly, and I enter into the goodwill spirit by thanking the opposition. I am doing this because, for the first time in 13 years, the opposition has accepted this government's superannuation policy, and I thank the opposition for this. For 13 years, the opposition has argued against our superannuation initiatives. The opposition has bagged us and criticised us by saying that the government's initiatives will cause unemployment. There was a barrage of other criticisms, but, at last, after 13 years, the opposition has adopted our policies. The opposition is going to leave our initiatives in place if it is elected to government.

We welcome the fact that the opposition has adopted this government's policies on superannuation. Why?

Firstly, it highlights the lack of imagination and vision in opposition policy development&mdash;with the exception of you, Senator Watson, and Mr Connolly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trans-Tasman trade in food products is above the billion dollar mark and, therefore, of great value. In bringing this situation about, the bill is probably of more benefit to New Zealand than it is to Australia. However, in the other chamber both the shadow minister for health and human services and the shadow minister for consumer affairs, Mr Warren Truss, pointed out some of the problems which are related to the bill, although welcoming it coming before the parliament as a treaty before the legislation, which, as you know, is not a frequent occurrence in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trans-Tasman trade in food products is, as I mentioned, beneficial to both sides. This legislation has been rushed through parliament quickly and there has not been a lot of consideration given to it in the chambers themselves. Consumer groups have expressed some concern about a number of aspects of the legislation. One concern, for example, is the fact that the representatives are, effectively, appointed by the two governments. This means that, if government and industry have a representative from New Zealand, there is a risk that consumers' voices may be somewhat reduced. Consumers are concerned that the harmonisation process could lead to lower Australian standards in some areas and they are also concerned that, among the nine food code objectives outlined in the treaty to be signed, quality is not listed as a stated objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also transitional arrangements which cause concern, in that food which does not meet the Australian standards but does meet the New Zealand standards will be able to be sold in this country during the transitional arrangements.

We sought a number of assurances and a considerable amount of additional material from the minister. Our particular concerns centred around the fact that the bill deletes the words `providing it does not lower the Australian standard' from the objectives of the National Food Authority.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian standard will not be lowered to an international standard and the quality of food will not drop. If there is any adverse impact on any of these high ranked objectives in particular, the authority is required to put the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry, including issues such as Australia's clean and green reputation for foods, ahead of harmonisation with international standards. This ensures that Australian standards will not be lowered for the sake of harmonisation with international standards.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask now that the minister reiterate that we will indeed see before us disallowable instruments if any standards set by the authority are changed so that we in the Senate will all have an opportunity to discuss and debate any changes to ensure full and proper scrutiny so that the Australian public can benefit from these new arrangements with New Zealand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, I wish to go back to 1993 when the Industrial Reform Act was before us. There is no doubt that it was one of the most controversial pieces of legislation to ever be brought in here. I remember well when we were debating it that the gallery was full of people who were absolutely disenchanted with what the government was bringing before them, particularly with regard to the provisions that we are now dealing with&mdash;the unfair dismissal provisions. They were described&mdash;not by myself&mdash;by various commentators and people involved in the industry as being totally unfair, inequitable and unbalanced; and it was said they would create a bureaucratic nightmare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a moment or two I shall deal with that bureaucratic nightmare and put on the record some of the outcomes that have occurred as a result of that particular legislation. I also wish to move a second reading amendment, copies of which are about to be distributed, I understand, around the chamber. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"but the Senate, whilst recognising that this Bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Act remain a disincentive to job creation, impose a very heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and were enacted without proper prior consultation".</PARA>
<PARA>I particularly refer to the last words in that amendment, that they `were enacted without proper and prior consultation'. If we remember back to the Senate inquiry in 1993, one of the most consistent themes from every submission we received, even from some of the union submissions, was that there was a lack of consultation in putting that legislation together. Once again, in dealing with this side of it and in our discussions with ACCI, the National Farmers Federation, MTIA and a number of other employer organisations, we have had exactly the same concerns put to us. We have also had those concerns put to us by the state governments because this legislation has a very big impact on the operations of the state industrial systems. It would appear that, even though it was promised, there was virtually no consultation, and certainly no meaningful consultation with the states, in regard to the problems that have been created by the unfair dismissal provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to recap, I mention the bureaucratic nightmare that has been caused with regard to the unfair dismissal provisions. I did ask some questions at estimates this year about this and at that particular time, 29 May 1995, following that legislation, there had been some 9,921 applications brought forward with regard to unfair dismissal. That now exceeds 10,000, and there is a significant backlog in handling those applications. That was not something that occurred under the previous system when they were dealt with much more fairly, much more swiftly and much more consistently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we on our side of the chamber certainly are not opposed to having provisions for people who have genuine concerns about what occurred with their dismissal or the ending of their particular job, we believe that this legislation needs further amendment in terms of the unfair dismissal provisions. It is worth noting that there is much debate about industrial systems and what is the best system in this country, but one thing is for certain: it does not seem to matter, and I do not believe it will matter, what system there is because there will be those who will claim that they have been unfairly dismissed and those who actually treat somebody unfairly in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever system we have, it will be necessary to have a proper, fair, easily accessible, cheap, quick way of dealing with these particular matters. To have this sort of log jam in our industrial system now really reflects just how poorly and how badly that legislation has worked. It was a point that we raised over and over again on behalf of a number of people at that particular time. The key aspects of this particular legislation will now commence in the Industrial Relations Commission rather than in the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that that is basically a change to the starting point. We do not believe that it is going to help significantly in terms of dealing with the fundamental problems with the application, although there will be more emphasis on conciliation when dealing with them. One improvement in this particular legislation, which I am quite prepared to recognise, is that it will now be looking at all circumstances involved in the case whereas previously it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned some of the issues surrounding this legislation. I will now re-emphasise them and put them in a logical sequence. First, at the Labor Ministers Council meeting in Hobart on 19 May 1995, the federal minister, Mr Brereton, indicated that no amendments to the federal act would be considered for at least 12 months or until after the federal election. These amendments have been brought in hurriedly and there has been no consultation. While I am not criticising Mr Brereton for bringing in what he has, I do say that he should have met the commitment that consultation take place with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some amendments from the Democrats which I will briefly touch on. They concern costs of the court and the commission. I did make representations to Senator Bell to include, in terms of those amendments, both the court and the commission. He acknowledged that the Democrats would do that and we will be supporting those amendments. But with respect to the amendments being put forward by Senator Spindler regarding the National Labour Consultative Council we will not be supporting those. I shall make some comments with regard to those in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of dealing with this legislation now, I thought it would be useful if I went over a few of the key points of where the coalition sits in terms of industrial relations, particularly in view of the fact that there will be an election next year. I particularly want to emphasise that we believe in the principle of the freedom of choice, across the full spectrum of what that means. We believe in freedom of association, whether you want to belong to a union or whether you do not want to belong to a union. We believe that people should have the choice of the type of industrial system they work under, whether it be a workplace agreement, or a certified agreement, or an enterprise flexibility agreement or an award. That will be a central plank of our policy position, as has already been outlined by Mr Reith and Mr Howard. I think it is very important to modernise, and to move at the pace that the rest of the world is with modernising the workplace so that freedom of choice is an essential characteristic of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point that I raise is the principle that all Australians be treated equally before the law. The principle in terms of being treated equally before the law is that they must behave equally before the law. One cannot help but note in today's newspaper, with regard to the unfortunate occurrences up at Weipa and the millions and millions of dollars that have been lost through that industrial dispute, the threats of possible further industrial action by, I think, the metals union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though a decision was made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission last week with regard to the resolving of the particular concerns before that tribunal, it was not until yesterday that the decision was made for those striking workers at Weipa to go back. In our view, that is not good enough and that must be dealt with so that people behave within the law. The decision was made and the instruction was given. In fact, the instruction to go back to work was given on a number of occasions during the dispute but no notice was taken of it. We cannot have a legal situation where one side of the equation obeys the law and the other side just thumbs its nose at it as it chooses. That is what has been happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will maintain the current award system overseen by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The coalition will support the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deliver safety net wage increases for the lowest paid. The coalition will retain the certified agreement system but reform it to enable CAs to reflect more accurately the circumstances of individual enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government system of enterprise flexibility agreements, we believe, and we said at the time of the legislation, has failed. It has not had the penetration that is really necessary for a modernised workplace, and we will change that and put in place workplace agreements. These workplace agreements will allow clearly and succinctly either individual workplace agreements or collective workplace agreements&mdash;whatever the employees in a particular workplace might choose to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workplace agreements must pass a no-disadvantage test against fair and responsible community standards which will ensure adequate protection, especially for the low paid. Although this is not a total list&mdash;there will be further announcements in due course&mdash;these conditions will include the relevant applicable classification award hourly rate; four weeks paid annual leave; two weeks paid sick leave; 12 months parental leave; family leave in accordance with the AIRC decision; equal pay for equal work of equal value; and jury service.

The coalition will make it an offence to attempt to force an independent contractor to join a union or to discriminate against the contractor on the grounds of union membership or non-membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I would make some comments on the amendment of the National Labour Consultative Council. We believe that the National Labour Consultative Council does need reforming but we do not agree with the way the Democrats have suggested that it should be reformed. I believe that Senator Spindler is handling this particular aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler's amendment&mdash;and we have not seen the final amendment&mdash;is similar to the amendment that was moved in 1993 when the IR reform act was before us. In regard to these suggested changes, we are concerned that there has not been consultation with the various members of the NLCC at this particular time. Nor has there been consultation with a number of other employer organisations, some outside the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no consultation with these organisations as to how a reformed National Labour Consultative Council should work. Nor has there been any discussion or consultation with any of the states as to how this will work. We believe that we should at least examine, when we look at what exists in the various states, whether there is a role for a state representative on this particular council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other sector that is totally ignored by the National Labour Consultative Council is the non-union sector. We now see that close to 75 per cent of the Australian work force is not represented by the union movement. We believe that we should at least examine whether there is a mechanism that can be put in place to give that portion of the work force an opportunity to have representation so that they can put their views about what they require in terms of dealing with any industrial relations matters before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, we will not support those amendments. However, we give notice that when we are in government we will be looking at this. We will be getting the parties together to examine and upgrade the role of the National Labour Consultative Council. While the consultative council did have some forceful or useful activities under previous ministers, there is no doubt that since Mr Brereton has been the minister it has been almost a totally non-active council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe these amendments go far enough. We do not believe that there is fairness between the parties as far as the unfair dismissal provisions are concerned. When we are in government we will address the particular further concerns that will be required to be dealt with under this legislation. We have seen over the last three or four months a real dose of the destruction that can occur when an industrial system goes wrong. We have seen what can happen when the balance between the parties gets out of kilter. We have seen unnecessary damage to the Australian economy in that particular time. We have seen action taken&mdash;led by the ACTU, I believe for political reasons, and secretly and quietly endorsed by the government&mdash;that was not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I once again make the point that had the minister, Mr Brereton, or the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), or any other minister for that matter, taken action under section 99(2) of the Industrial Relations Act, the matter could have been brought before the arbitration commission much sooner. The strike could have been avoided and we need not have seen the millions and millions of dollars lost as far as that legislation is concerned. Australia's industrial relations system is lagging behind the rest of the world. We are not meeting the productivity requirements that are required to be competitive out in the workplace. We, on our side of politics, have certainly committed ourselves to doing something about it. We will be addressing those particular issues as we go into the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nonetheless, we are grateful that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has called in today, so I will ask him a question. According to the World Bank, Australia fell from 19th in the world in 1992 to 22nd in 1993 in terms of international per capita income. Now the Business Council expects that we will slide even further. Why is Australia, one of the world's most resource rich countries, continuing to slide down the international league table? Is it because, as the McKinsey study shows, Australia's relatively low productivity is costing the country around $30 billion a year in lost opportunities, cut prices and increased wages, or is it simply that after 13 years of Labor this is as good as it gets?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a pretty extraordinary question to ask in a week in which we have just had an announcement of a 1.6 per cent growth for this quarter, which indicates that we are absolutely on track to sustain a very substantial and, importantly, positive rate of growth for the period ahead, just as we have for the last 17 quarters, which is an Australian record since these statistics were kept. The Australian economy is in remarkably good shape in terms of all the basic fundamentals. You know what those fundamentals are, and I will be happy to repeat them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial further statistic that emerged this week is the balance of payments figures, external debt, the external payments account. The October figures of this morning demonstrate absolutely, again, that we are on track in terms of the current account deficit recording its sixth consecutive monthly decrease in trend terms and reaching its lowest level since February 1994 in such trend terms. It is absolutely in line with the government's budget forecast, despite all the scepticism, neurosis and angst that you were hurling at us for months on end. The parrots are not talking about the current account deficit any more&mdash;the caravan has moved on&mdash;because basically we have a structural environment in terms of our capacity to go on generating exports that will keep that merchandise account positive, making this not a problem of any significant magnitude at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the other elements of our economic environment&mdash;productivity performance, investment growth, export growth and the capacity, at the same time as we are growing in all these respects, to sustain a wage environment, including the social wage&mdash;make us the envy of the other developed economies. There are fundamental disparities which exist between economies like North America, where you have a high wage environment and high levels of efficiency in many ways in the economy but a very poor social justice set of indicators running alongside that, compared with the dilemma faced, on the other hand, by developed countries in Europe where everything is doing fine in social justice terms and social equity terms but you have fundamental inefficiencies evident in that side of the economy. Australia has it right; we have the balance right in all those respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not seen the particular figures to which Senator Alston is referring. It is inevitable, given the explosive growth of so many economies in the East Asian region, that there would be some change in relativities in terms of income per head figures. That has been a fact of life throughout the course of this century. None of these things are ever static. In terms of the fundamental strength of the economy, the sustainability of the growth that we have in the economy, the way in which interest rates and inflation and all those other key indicators have a capacity to sustain growth on an ongoing basis in an employment reducing way, the way all those figures are coming together gives Australia absolutely nothing whatsoever to be ashamed about in terms of international comparisons; in fact, a very great deal to be proud of.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to put the current export situation in a bit of an historic context, because by some accounts Tuesday of this week saw an important anniversary in Australia's economic history. The historians suggest that 28 November 1795 was the first day of any commercial export from Australia&mdash;from the Hawkesbury region of New South Wales to India. It was the first recorded export in our post-European settlement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are talking about 200 years of Australia as an exporting nation. We spent a lot of those 200 years missing a lot of good opportunities and surviving on the basis of extraordinary resource potential and failure to develop all the other opportunities, particularly over the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, when our sloth allowed a lot of good opportunities to go unremarked. But in the past decade we have seen a fundamental and qualitative change in our trade performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of the key figures in this last week which indicate the direction and the strength of the changes taking place. This supports entirely the point that Senator Gareth Evans has just made. For the first time in our history, last Tuesday's figures show that we have achieved a quarterly surplus in our trade in services, which is where the world's economic trade growth is most concentrated. That is a first in our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we saw the release of the national accounts that showed net exports contributed 1.3 per cent to GDP growth. While people are saying, `Somehow or other that's a problem,' that is exactly the sort of growth Australia needs&mdash;growth generated by net exports. Today's balance of payments figures confirm a significant improvement in our current account outlook, which is causing so much anxiety for our colleagues across the way who wish things would continue to get worse. They continue to pray for disaster and get disappointed when they find any success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These indicators suggest that Australia may well have stepped onto a higher economic growth path based on improved export performance, particularly compared with our record in the two decades up to the 1980s. For example, over the last decade, merchandise exports have recorded average trend growth of 8.7 per cent a year and manufactured exports have grown even more quickly, by 15 per cent a year. Elaborately transformed manufactures have grown by 17 per cent and services have grown by nine per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are seeing that there is every indication that this higher growth path can be sustained into the next century. We have already broken the Australian record for sustained economic growth. The important thing to note is that our trade strategy and performance suggest that we can sustain that economic growth into the next decade with all the consequential benefits for jobs and living standards which follow from that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point about income distribution within Australia is that it can be understood only in the context of the social wage, which is the means by which the government provides health, education, housing and child-care benefits to all Australians. The increases and the improvements in that social wage and in benefits delivered in ways other than through the wage packet have had a dramatic impact in redistributing income to those most in need. Recent research from NCSEM has found that the social wage has increased&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen to this, Senator Knowles. The social wage has increased from $969 in 1982-83 to $1,677 in 1994-95. It is the case that low and middle income families benefit very substantially from the non-cash component of the social wage. For example, an average middle income family receives benefits now valued at $225 per week. That is on top of the 146 per cent increase in social security payments that has been achieved between 1983 and 1995. For example, additional family payments for children from 13 years to 15 years have increased by 146 per cent; rent assistance has increased by between 78 per cent and 137 per cent; the age pension, about which those on your side are so ignorant and indifferent, has increased by between 13 per cent and 14 per cent; and real household disposable income has increased by 41.5 per cent during the period between the March quarter 1983 and the June quarter 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the research by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling shows that during the 1980s the richest 10 per cent of the population got poorer, relatively speaking, and those with low and middle incomes in fact got richer. It is a matter of understanding the relevant components that go into the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preliminary results from the University of Melbourne study support that. They show that, once the impact of governmental intervention in the form of cash income support, the way the tax system operates and non-cash social wage benefits are all taken into account, the small increase in the dispersion of private incomes that has been evident since 1981-82 and to which you are referring is in fact reversed. It is reversed in its practical impact. In fact, the distribution of income was more equal in 1993-94, the last year for which the University of Melbourne study is applicable, than it was in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are these: government intervention, our government's intervention, through the cash transfer system, through the tax system and through the social wage generally has increased the living standards of Australians across all incomes and contributed to increased equality in this country.</PARA>

It does not pick up the redistributive effect of the tax system or the non-cash benefits of the social wage. This survey and ones like it, including the OECD one which I think you referred to earlier&mdash;the Luxembourg income study, the international one&mdash;do not show the total picture in terms of the real income distribution and the real total picture as it exists when you take into account the tax system, when you take into account cash transfers and when you take into account all the other benefits of the social wage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly concerned, as senators more sensitive than Senators Alston over there would also be, no doubt, by press reports that special army guards have been placed outside the houses of several National League for Democracy, NLD, leaders and that there is widespread speculation that some re-arrests may be imminent. Such a course, if it were to occur, would be a very serious development and a clear demonstration, if we have not had this already, that the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the whole national convention process were not motivated by a genuine desire on the part of the SLORC to bring about democratic change in Burma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The most obvious formal vehicle for that process of reconciliation and democratic change would obviously be the national convention, but the lack of confidence in the convention by the NLD is such that, following the opening session of the resumed convention a couple of days ago, on 28 November, the NLD has decided to withdraw its delegates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said on many occasions, the Australian government has reservations about the composition and process of the convention. We have encouraged the government of Myanmar, or Burma, to open up membership of the convention to make it more representative, both of the will of the people at large and also specifically the ethnic composition of the country, and also to permit within the convention more open discussion and debate of the issues that are vitally important to the country's political future. If this were done, the credibility of the process would manifestly improve and the chances of the convention's conclusions being accepted by the people of Myanmar, as well as being better recognised overseas, would be significantly increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we urge once again the SLORC and all the political parties to proceed with caution, to address their differences through dialogue in a spirit of national reconciliation. Both the SLORC and the NLD remain on record as acknowledging the importance of national reconciliation; the important thing is to actually deliver it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Can I say finally that the Australian government continues to urge all parties to proceed peacefully and to avoid any possibility of a repeat of the mass civil disturbances and violence, the extreme and outrageous violence, that marred Burma in 1988 and 1989. It is obvious that confrontation and violence are not going to resolve the current political problems in the country. Dialogue undertaken in a spirit of genuine reconciliation should be able to achieve the stated aim of both the government and the NLD, which is to establish a stable and peaceful multi-party democratic system of government. This is manifestly the desire of the people of Burma. It is also the desire of the whole international community. We all want to see that troubled country finally achieve the peace and prosperity that were promised in the years immediately after independence but which have been so long denied.</PARA>

It concerns a meeting of the ACT branch of the Public Service Union today, where unionists are complaining of the redistribution of income in the Public Service from the lower income earners to higher income earners. They point out that, since this Labor government assumed office in 1983, wages for lower and middle grades in the APS have fallen between one and 15 per cent, while real incomes for the highest grades have risen between 11 and 33 per cent. That is, all low and middle income earners in the Public Service have suffered big declines while the highest earners have enjoyed big successes. Why is this so? Why haven't you protected your own low and middle income employees?

I would be interested to hear what your side of politics is saying about that particular process within the Public Service, which has been one of steady improvement in conditions, as you would expect, over that period. It has been accompanied certainly by some increases in remuneration at the higher levels of the Public Services&mdash;increases in remuneration which we have not heard you challenge at any stage of that process because you have argued them to be, as we have acknowledged, necessary to maintain competitiveness at the higher managerial levels within the service with salaries and remuneration that are on offer outside.</PARA></TALK.START>

Every December in the last decade, under your government's policies, the teen jobless rate has jumped an average of four per cent at the end of the school year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I want to again state the true facts about this definition of youth unemployment. I have said before in the parliament that the full-time teenage unemployment rate is 29 per cent, but that does not mean that 29 per cent of Australian teenagers are unemployed. That is because only 25 per cent of teenagers were available for full-time work in October&mdash;that is the last month we got the figures; 55 per cent were in school; and 13 per cent were in full-time post-school education. What we should focus on is the 95,600 teenagers looking for full-time work, which is 7.5 per cent of the total teenage population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting, of course, that Labor has reduced this number from when John Howard was Treasurer, when the population was a lot smaller.

All I can say to you, Senator Campbell, is that I am not going to speculate hypothetically what those figures would be. I would say that, if it were not for the Working Nation initiatives going back to May last year, there would be a lot more unemployed young people.

Earlier this week you told the Senate that Mr Graeme Campbell's anti-immigrant comments were disgusting. However, your colleague Mr Eric Fitzgibbon said that Tuesday's caucus meeting had a majority in favour of Mr Campbell and that, if the Prime Minister had put the matter to the vote, it would have been `quite embarrassing' for Mr Keating. Furthermore, caucus chairman, Mr Jim Snow, said of Mr Campbell:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of claims by a South Australian small businessman about political interference in the decisions of the CSIRO. I have here a statutory declaration sworn by Mr David Paul Battersby to that effect, which I now table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr David Battersby runs a small advertising company in Adelaide. The statutory declaration relates to events last year after he had reached agreement with the CSIRO to erect advertising billboards on the CSIRO's property at O'Halloran Hill in the Adelaide southern suburbs. The CSIRO has confirmed Mr Battersby's claim that shortly before the contracts were finalised Ms Chris Gallus, the member for Hindmarsh, contacted the CSIRO complaining that a number of other advertising companies had not been informed of the arrangement. According to the CSIRO, and in their normally understated terms, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strong impression given was that Mrs Gallus would actively canvass against the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Battersby found out about this intervention indirectly. He found out through a large Adelaide advertising company and, as a consequence, he then rang Ms Gallus. In his statutory declaration Mr Battersby states that she, in this case meaning Ms Gallus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . told me the project was dead and would not go ahead, stating she had previously been on some CSIRO review board and had a lot of powerful friends at CSIRO who had assured her our contract would be terminated.</PARA>
<PARA>In the statutory declaration he goes on to refer to Ms Gallus saying these words to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whilst I don't like to see anyone go bankrupt, from where I sit I just sent you under, you're playing in the big league now.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to ask the question: why does Ms Gallus have an interest in ending this project? She told the CSIRO that it was to give other companies a chance to bid for the contract to erect hoardings, but when the matter was raised in the parliament last year she told the House of Representatives that it was `on the basis of my well-known interest in the environment'. Not only did she not mention the issues of the other companies in the parliament; she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither I nor anyone else, I believe, could have had anything of a commercial nature to gain in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>The two explanations are not consistent. If indeed the environment was her concern, as she told the parliament, there could be no way that she could entertain anyone putting up a billboard in that location. But in fact she told the CSIRO her concern was of the commercial aspects of the contract that had led her to become involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what we have to consider against this background is that during the 1993 election Ms Gallus had a number of large billboards around her electorate, some in choice locations, which were provided by two of Adelaide's large billboard advertising firms, and these same firms are also recorded in the Liberal Party's 1992-93 declaration of expenditure as having made donations to the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">O'Halloran Hill is, by the way, in the seat of Kingston, which does not even adjoin Hindmarsh, and Ms Gallus was the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs at the time. The situation that I now have reported before me in a statutory declaration by an Adelaide small businessman is that Ms Gallus brought pressure to bear on the CSIRO to terminate a commercial contract and then misrepresented her motives in a statement in the House of Representatives. Now that there is a statutory declaration before me, as minister for science and minister responsible for the CSIRO at ministerial level I will investigate this matter to the full. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The documents read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COASTAL SURVEILLANCE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22 November 1995, Senator MacGibbon asked me two questions about the performance specifications in the Coastwatch contract and also asked me to release the contract for public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of Senator MacGibbon's questions was ". . . in relation to pay load/range performance and in relation to operations under Instrument Flight Rules, what performance specification differences are there between the RFP and the contract signed with Surveillance Australia in relation to the Britten Norman Islander?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For obvious commercial confidentiality reasons, I will not be making the contract public. However I am able to table that portion of the contract which relates to the aircraft performance requirements for Task One (the visual task) and the corresponding portion of the specimen contract from the Request for Proposals (RFP).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will note that there are three matters on which the documents differ; a minor issue relating to the Global Positioning System, seating and the speed at which the aircraft is to operate. The specimen contract called for an operational speed of 130-150 knots indicated air speed, while the actual contract calls for an indicated air speed of 120-150 knots. Attorney-General's have advised that this difference in speed is permissible within the terms of the RFP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All other performance requirements are identical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no requirement in either the RFP, the specimen contract or the actual contract for the aircraft to operate solely under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The only requirement is that the aircraft be approved for IFR and the Islander complies with that requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator MacGibbon's second question was, "Is the contractor fully meeting all the contract performance standards now that his equipment is on line?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not all of the contractors equipment is on line. The aircraft for Tasks Two and Three are not scheduled to commence operations until I July 1996 and I January 1996 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the seven aircraft specified for Task One, the contractor is fully meeting its contracted performance standards for that Task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 21 November, Senator MacGibbon in moving that the Senate take note of my answer to a question without notice from Senator Colston, raised what was effectively a series of further questions about the Coastwatch contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an attempt to bolster his claim that there is "public concern in the aviation industry about the awarding of the latest Coastwatch contract", Senator MacGibbon says that the Pilatus Britten Norman Islander is an aircraft "which is universally recognised as being quite unsuitable for the task that Customs wishes to use it for". He went on to say that "It is an aeroplane that is very slow, it has a very limited pay load and it has a limited range". He said that "it is very hard to see out of. . . and is very noisy".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator MacGibbon's reference to the aircraft's speed and range is, I presume, a comparison with the Shrike aircraft used by the previous contractor for the same task. It is true that the Islander does not have the speed or the range of the Shrike&mdash;but it does meet the speed and range requirements of the current contract. More importantly it meets the Coastwatch operational coverage requirements. It is neither very slow nor range-limited when measured against the task requirement. Senator MacGibbon's statement that it is "flat out making 115 knots on the cruise" is inaccurate. The aircraft operates at 120 knots.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to visibility from the aircraft, it has been claimed that the fixed undercarriage on the Islander affects the observers' field of view. The fact that the undercarriage could not be retracted was, of course, known from the outset and allegations of the problems it causes have been overstated. Firstly, there is only one observer affected and that is the crew member who sits in the rear of the aircraft. This person also operates the onboard observer's computer and tactical radios. To help overcome the fixed undercarriage visibility effect, the windows of the aircraft have been significantly modified, including large bubble windows and full length glass on the rear door and the opposite side of the fuselage. The result is that effective searches can be carried out by the rear observer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to noise, the crew are all required to wear communications headsets for operational reasons. These headsets are special noise reducing headsets which effectively reduce the ambient noise level of about 95db to about 65db at the ear. This is well within OH&amp;S guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator MacGibbon says that "the aircraft does not possess any effective air conditioning". On this point he is totally wrong. The air conditioning system has been fully tested in tropical conditions and meets the contractual requirement that it maintain a cabin temperature to a maximum of 25(0)C and 60% humidity on a 32(0)C 70% humidity day with all equipment operating and five crew on board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator MacGibbon said that the Islander "cannot take off under instrument flight rules with a load that it can under the visual flight rules". What the Senator omitted to mention is that this is true for most light aircraft. I would also point out that the contract does not require operation under instrument flight rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator MacGibbon referred to allegations that the company (by which I presume he meant the new contractor, Surveillance Australia) "sought to get an increase in the maximum all-up weight of the aircraft which was denied by CASA, or the Civil Aviation Authority as it was known at the time".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 August 1995, in my written answer to a Question on Notice from Senator MacGibbon, I said Surveillance Australia did apply to the then CAA for approval to operate the Islander at a weight greater than its certified maximum take-off weight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this application was NOT denied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surveillance Australia withdrew the application on 4 August 1995 when it became clear, following a weight reduction program and a reassessment of the aircraft performance, that the Islander could meet the initial requirements of the contract within its certified maximum take off weight. In the interests of accuracy I should point out that the aircraft does not currently have the 100 kg growth capacity required within its certified maximum take off weight but that capacity is not required by Coastwatch at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding my written answer to Senator MacGibbon, Mr Paul Phelan, a aviation journalist based in Cairns, has asked whether I was inaccurately advised on this matter and queried whether CASA did in fact reject the application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I seek leave to table a letter from CASA confirming that the application was withdrawn not rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator MacGibbon also stated that two Canberra officers found that the Islander was "completely unsuited to the Customs role".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two Canberra and three Cairns based officers chartered a standard Islander in Cairns to evaluate it as a visual surveillance platform. At approximately the same time another two Canberra based officers flew in a specially equipped surveillance Islander in England. The Cairns reports indicated that the Islander, when measured against the Shrike was only about 55% as effective as the Shrike as a visual platform. On that basis these officers did not think that the Islander was an acceptable visual surveillance platform. The report from England gave a more optimistic view of the Islander as officers on this flight had the opportunity to use bubble windows and sit in special seats. Both these reports were considered by the Proposal Evaluation Committee which concluded that the Islander was not as effective a visual platform as the Shrike, but that it could complete the visual surveillance requirements outlined in the RFP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note with interest that Senator MacGibbon has made no comment in his criticisms of this aircraft about the significant difference in age between the Islanders which are new aircraft and Shrikes used on the previous contract, and offered for this contract, the newest one of which was built in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that the Senate recognise, notwithstanding some disadvantages the Islander has when measured against the Shrike, that these have been taken into account in awarding the contract and in the Coastwatch program. Additional flying hours have been allocated to the total program and that increase, taken with the technology which has been introduced in the new contract, has resulted in an increase of 190% in the Coastwatch coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must confess to some frustration about the continuing campaign to infer that the Coastwatch contract evaluation process was faulty because the Islander was chosen as part of an overall package put forward by Surveillance Australia, and that the coverage provided under the new contract, is somehow inferior to that provided under the previous contract with a consequent risk to our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular I am frustrated by comments such as Senator MacGibbon's that the Pilatus Britten Norman Islander "is universally recognised as being quite unsuitable for the tasks that Customs wishes to use it for". In making this comment he is echoing a statement by Skywest, the previous contractor and an unsuccessful tenderer for the new contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet it is a fact that Britten Norman Islanders were offered as fully complying aircraft by three aviation organisations who were short listed for the Coastwatch contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some universal recognition that the Islander is unsuitable!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Skywest wrote to me on 29 September 1995 saying that "the Islander aircraft, in particular, is unsuitable for the role envisaged and non-compliant for the specification contained in the original RFP and the resultant contract". The Company goes on to say that I have been misinformed by Coastwatch officers in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I found this a surprising allegation on the part of Skywest who, on two separate occasions in 1994, advised Customs in writing that the Islander was "mission compliant in full" and that "this aircraft is in widespread use worldwide as a low cost surveillance platform. It has well established credentials as a reliable and flexible platform".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am unaware of any reason for Skywest to change its mind about the Islander since 1994 other than the fact that it did not win the Coastwatch contract.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ALDRED ALLEGATIONS OF PAEDOPHILE ACTIVITY BY DFAT OFFICERS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 6 June 1995 I gave a preliminary answer to a question without notice from Senator Wheelwright relating to a number of allegations made in Parliament on 5 June by Mr Ken Aldred MP concerning paedophile activities by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I am now in a position to advise him and the Senate as to the outcomes of the police investigations that have subsequently taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immediately following these allegations, the Secretary of the Department, Mr Costello, wrote to the Australian Federal Police asking that a rigorous, comprehensive and full investigation be undertaken by the AFP. The Secretary urged that, if necessary, the AFP investigation should revisit all former allegations and include visits to other countries to follow up the investigations. The Secretary subsequently wrote to all major media organisations and to NGOs that had indicated concern about these issues asking them to supply all relevant information they might have to the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police has undertaken an extensive investigation of these matters which has by no means been confined to Mr Aldred's allegations. Personnel and security files of the Department have been reviewed as far back as the mid-1940s. Dozens of interviews have been conducted with Departmental officers, NGO personnel and members of the media. An AFP team has travelled abroad, liaised with other national police forces and judicial officers. AFP officers posted in Asian countries have also contributed to the investigation. It has taken dedicated AFP and Departmental sources some months to bring the investigation to a conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP has now advised the Secretary of my Department of the results of its investigation into the three allegations made by Mr Aldred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first allegation was that the senior management of DFAT has tolerated and promoted diplomats known to be paedophiles.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP investigation has concluded "that there is no evidence to support the allegation that the senior management of DFAT has tolerated and promoted diplomats known to be paedophiles".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second allegation was that DFAT has obstructed investigation of this matter, attempted to prevent examination of relevant documents and deterred Departmental witnesses from providing evidence.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP has advised that "during the investigation no evidence was revealed to substantiate the allegation that DFAT has obstructed investigation of this matter, attempted to prevent examination of relevant documents or deter Departmental officers from providing evidence".</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the AFP has advised that it is "satisfied that the Department has fully assisted the AFP to ensure that the matter was dealt with in an open and accountable manner".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third allegation was that approximately 20 DFAT Senior Executive Services officers are engaged in paedophile activities in Australia and overseas. The bulk of the AFP report deals with this third allegation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When asked by Police, Mr Aldred eventually named 16 officers of whom only 12 are serving officers of the portfolio. Of those named by Mr Aldred ten officers are or were members of the Senior Executive Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the remaining three, the situation is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to 13 of the 16 officers named by Mr Aldred, the AFP advised that "no evidence has been identified which substantiates the claims made against them".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to one officer, the AFP advised that a brief of evidence has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration as to whether criminal charges should be laid in regard to recent matters under the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Director of Public Prosecutions has, as yet, made no decision on this matter and no presumption should be made either way as to what the DPP will decide in the exercise of his discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of another officer, the AFP has advised that there was historical information from which it could reasonably have been suspected that he may have been involved in paedophile activities a decade ago.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This information was considered in the 1980s by the Department: a view was reached that the officer's account of events was a credible one, and that it could not be concluded that he had been engaged in paedophile activity.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current AFP investigation did not identify any evidence of subsequent possible paedophile activity by this officer and there are no grounds for laying criminal charges. However, in the light of the AFP investigation, the Secretary of my Department is of the view that it may be necessary to reconsider aspects of the case and whether there has been any departure from the obligations imposed upon all officers by the Public Service Act. He is seeking legal advice on this aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As regards one former officer who left the Department many years ago, the AFP has stated that no criminal action can be taken under the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 because the information relating to that former officer pre-dates that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AFP has advised that Mr Aldred was unable to provide any evidence to substantiate any of his allegations against the 16 officers. Any substantive information resulted from investigations and enquiries which were in place before Mr Aldred made his allegations on 5 June.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was made clear at the time of Mr Aldred's allegations, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in no way condones and cannot accept paedophile behaviour, or indeed any criminal activity, by its officers. As the Secretary of my Department made clear through the media and a variety of other channels at the time, the Department hopes that all persons who have any evidence of such activity by any officer of the Department would bring it to the attention of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What was objectionable then, and remains objectionable now, was that Mr Aldred did not first take his allegations to the Police, but instead aired them in Parliament, identifying certain officers, and alleging cover-up of a network of officially condoned paedophile activity within the Department. In so doing, he has besmirched the name of a large number of officers of the Department and provoked unfounded fears and concerns about the integrity of the institution, its management and administration. If he had first taken the matters to the Australian Federal Police, they would have been fully investigated and the outcome would have been the same. That he chose otherwise is an unwarranted abuse of Parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I deeply regret that unfounded allegations were made against a number of officers of the Public Service and that they and their families have gone through undeserved suffering and harm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, it remains the Government's view that exploitation of children by paedophiles, in Australia and overseas, is particularly abhorrent criminal conduct. I repeat that calls made previously by myself and the Secretary of my Department that any person or organisation who has information in this regard should bring it to the attention of the Police.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr President, I am grateful for your response, but I invite you to consider a number of things that I think are very important for people to understand if they are to have confidence that what is said on one side is treated equally when it is said on the other side. I understand from what you have just said that you understood what the minister had said to be a simple statement&mdash;`What you're saying is false.' I could readily accept that, with all the din and clatter that goes on in this place, it would be easy to not hear the first two words of his statement, `You know'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be easier to hear it as, `What you're saying is false,' rather than what he did say, which is, `You know what you're saying is false.'

Even Senator Evans couldn't manage to avoid what was staring people in the face; that is, if you say, `You know what you're saying is false,' it is tantamount to calling someone a liar. He put it to you this way: `If the remark as turns up in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> actually is, "You know what you said is false," we might have to look at it.' At that point you said:</PARA>

I have no doubt that the Australian people, when they face up to the choices at the next election and when they look at the record of this government both on unemployment and on falling real wages, will have but one choice; that is, to vote you out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the figures of unemployment. Sadly, we have been through the cycle. We have had our five minutes of sunshine. Going back to the last election, we had one million people unemployed. We had our five minutes of sunshine and some economic growth for a little while&mdash;economic growth that would have been sufficient to really eat into unemployment. Unfortunately, the figures have now turned around again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is on the rise. It bottomed out at 8.3 per cent; it has now risen steadily to 8.5 per cent. As I said, over 600,000 Australians are still out of work. But what about the unemployment rate for young people? It is three times that of the rate for adults. Unfortunately, that is on the rise again as well. It bottomed out at 27.1 per cent in February; since then it has risen to 28.1 per cent. Ninety-two thousand Australian adolescents are out of work. There are 92,000 young people in this country who are wanting work but unable to obtain it under the policies of this Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the regions the position is much worse. The employment rate for adults is up around 13 per cent to 14 per cent. The unemployment rate for young people is up around 30 per cent to 40 per cent. There is no doubt why so many within the regions of Australia are angry about the record of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, those who have been fortunate enough to maintain employment during this period have little to be grateful to this government for. I really do think it is fascinating. If ever this government responded positively to one sector of the community you would have thought it would be to its own public servants. The document that I have referred to from the Public Service Union&mdash;it refers to the redistribution of salaries within the Public Service, from the workers to management, under Labor&mdash;is really quite enlightening. When we look at the lower levels of salary within the Public Service&mdash;right from the bottom levels up to nearly $30,000, from an ASO1 up to an ASO6&mdash;we see there has been a fall in real income of between 9.6 per cent and 14.8 per cent since 1983. That is a fall of nearly 15 per cent in real income during the period of this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The middle income range of the Public Service, $29,000 to $35,000, is still falling, but the fall is smaller&mdash;between five and 1.2 per cent. But for the better off in the Public Service, Labor's record is to have given them rises in real terms of between 11 and 33 per cent.

Of course, the 767,000 people is a fictitious figure as well because what this mob have done is simply taken them off the employment queues and put them into all these other programs where they do now show up on the unemployment queues. The fact of the matter is that most of those people who are out there, sadly, still are not getting jobs. They are doing training courses or whatever.

<PARA>Senator Evans was breathtaking in his arrogance and, frankly, his ignorance about the economy in his answer today. He described the economy as being in great shape. He said, `The fundamentals of the Australian economy are as rock solid as they have ever been.' It was the most extraordinary answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that struck me is that it really does not matter what the state of the Australian economy is. The government will always say that it is in terrific shape or that what is happening is on course and according to forecasts, et cetera. When we went into recession in 1990 or thereabouts, the government said, `Well, that's terrific. We've got to have this recession. This is exactly what the Australian economy needs. This is to be expected. This is what we want.' Then when the economy recovered and we had a brief period of growth of six per cent, which everyone knew was completely unsustainable under this government's policies, the government said, `This is fantastic. Isn't this great? We've got the best growth in the world.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the growth, as evidenced by the national accounts yesterday, is back down to half of that&mdash;just over three per cent&mdash;that is terrific as well. It really does not matter what the state of the economy is&mdash;you think it is fantastic. You have absolutely no credibility when you come to comment on the economy. Senator Evans in particular, who many regard as having no knowledge of economics, is equally without any credibility at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in the form of the minister representing the Prime Minister, is completely blind to the economic realities facing 18 million Australians. The economy is not in great shape. It is in very bad shape, as revealed yesterday by the national accounts. The worst part about it is the callous disregard which the government clearly has for the three-quarters of a million Australians who remain unemployed under its policies, the 8.7 per cent of the work force who cannot get a job under its policies. The fact is that the unemployment rate is actually increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave evidence yesterday about the findings of the National Institute of Labour Studies, which show that the government have no hope of achieving their five per cent unemployment target by the year 2000. The best they think we can achieve by the year 2000 is about 7 1/2 per cent, and even that will require a growth rate of over 3 1/2 per cent, which you are not achieving on the basis of the national accounts, which, Senator Evans says, are in terrific shape. They give a growth rate of 3.3 per cent, which means that unemployment will continue to rise. More Australians will be out of work. Many economists have commented, on the basis of those figures, that unemployment will be over nine per cent by the early part of next year. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a very serious matter. It is clearly the case that a member of the other House, Mrs Gallus, did interfere and cause the CSIRO to terminate an agreement they had with a small businessman who was entering into the advertising field and could well have caused him to go bankrupt. Mrs Gallus acknowledges and admits that she sought to interfere in the contract proceeding, which was to erect billboards on O'Halloran Hill in South Australia. She gave her reason as being one of environmental concern. That is clearly not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Gallus would not have even known that Mr David Battersby and the CSIRO were proposing to erect billboards on O'Halloran Hill. The only people who knew that were people in the advertising area. Contracts had been let for advertising on at least two of the billboards. A company had been employed to market those billboards. Discussions that have been had, and discussions that I have been able to verify, will confirm that Mrs Gallus acted on behalf of one of those companies, sought to have the contract terminated on the basis of a complaint on behalf of those companies and sought to not allow Mr Battersby and his company to enter into the advertising area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Battersby, his wife and two children and the small company that they had were confronted with a debt of over $70,000&mdash;a debt that could well have bankrupted them and forced them to sell their home. The opposition, who continually claim to be the repositories of all propriety and integrity, should not allow this matter to go unnoticed in terms of Mrs Gallus's claim that somehow something came across her desk. I would like to read parts of Mr Battersby's statutory declaration, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I decided to ring Chris Gallus and see what her objections were. She stated that she was acting on environmental grounds, and that I didn't have Council approval. I asked Mrs Gallus whose behalf she was acting on as no council application had been submitted and as no site works were visible&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>because they had not commenced&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">only persons involved in the advertising industry would know about the development. She replied, "something had come across her desk". During the course of our conversation, she twice asked me how much rent I was paying CSIRO. Both times I told her that was private and confidential. She then told me the project was dead and would not go ahead, stating she had previously been on some CSIRO Review Board and had a lot of powerful friends at CSIRO who had assured her our contract would be terminated.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important to understand the sequence of events here. A Mr Patchell of the CSIRO contacted Mr Battersby and told him that he had had calls from Mrs Gallus, and that Mrs Gallus was applying political pressure for the arrangement not to proceed. Indeed, when Mr Patchell spoke to Mr Battersby he said, that provided everything was in order, not to worry. However, he was then contacted again and told that the contract, the agreement, had been terminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to pursue this matter. I intend to ask the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to conduct an investigation of Mrs Gallus's actions in this particular issue. It is not acceptable that such an event take place. As I understand, it has caused the CSIRO to pay a settlement to Mr Battersby. But more importantly, Mr Battersby could have earned a significant amount of income from these advertising operations. If that is the position which a member of the opposition wants to take with regard to small business people or people trying to create small business, then it is just not acceptable.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1995 No.257, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 21 September 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations provide for discretions which are not subject to external merits review. You will recall that there has been previous correspondence between yourself and the Committee about the aspect of the principal Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 23 June 1994 the Committee wrote to you advising that it would refer to the Administrative Review Council for comment your advice that, if AAT review was provided, people would exploit those provisions to delay payment. The ARC has now recommended that decisions concerning the deferment, refund or remission of fees or charges made under the principal Regulations or the Meat Inspection (Fees) Orders and the Export Control (Fees) Orders, whether or not reconsidered by the Secretary, should be subject to merits review by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether it is intended to amend these instruments to provide for such review.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22 September 1995, you wrote to me as a result of amendments to the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations (the Regulations) considered by the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances at its meeting on 21 September 1995. In view of a recent recommendation by the Administrative Review Council, to the effect that decisions concerning the deferment, refund or remission of fees and charges under the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations, the Meat Inspection (Fees) Orders and the Export Control (Fees) Orders should be subject to merits review by the Administrative Review Tribunal, the Committee asked for my advice on whether it is intended to provide such a review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments which have prompted your present enquiry varied the provisions relating to the matters of which the Secretary must be satisfied or must take into account before remitting some or all of the amount of a charge imposed under the Export Inspection (Establishments Registration Charges) Act 1985, the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985, the Export Inspection (Service Charge) Act 1985 or the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Act 1993. The actual discretion was provided previously, however, in amendments to the Regulations made by Statutory Rules 1994, No. 369.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have advised the Committee in response to an earlier query, refunding and remission of charges pursuant to subregulation 6(8) of the Regulations has consequences for cost recovery in relation to programs administered by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) on a commercial basis. The quantum of charges is fixed periodically, in close consultation with industry bodies, to reflect and recoup AQIS's operating costs. Having regard to the degree of consultation that takes place when charges are calculated and agreed, the question of remissions or refunds, which are only available under subregulation 6(8) when collections are surplus to cost recovery requirements, should not generally arise. Where, however, an over-calculation of AQIS's operating costs properly referable to industry has occurred AQIS and industry will agree the amount of the refund or remission payable. Any decision is made in close consultation with the relevant industry consultative committees. The industry consultative committees are the established fora for discussions with industry regarding cost recovery arrangements. The industry representatives are drawn from all sectors of that industry and each affected industry group is given the opportunity through the consultative process to provide input into decisions to return over-recovered revenue to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am generally supportive of the comments made by the Administrative Review Council and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, in recent correspondence concerning the desirability of external merits review of decisions made under the Meat Inspection legislation. I must have regard also, however, to the agreements reached with industry and law that might be affected by individual rights of appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More widely, you will appreciate AQIS must make commercial decisions concerning relief from the payment of debts owing to the Commonwealth. I don't think this is appropriately a matter for merit review but rather a matter for the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the circumstances, therefore, as I have advised previously I do not consider review, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the Secretary's decisions relating to remitting and refunding charges either necessary or appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A disallowance motion on the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations (Amendment) would be contrary to industry's request. A provision in the Regulations to refund is necessary if AQIS is to administer overrecoveries in line with industry's wishes. AQIS would not be able to meet commitments given to industry groups to refund over-recoveries in the future if the Regulations were to be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although not affected by the amendments to the Regulations considered by the Committee on 21 September, I will comment on review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions under subregulation 2B(2) of the Regulations which provision permits the Secretary to specify a later due date for the payment of a charge than the due date prescribed and permit the payment of charges by instalments and also AAT review of decisions under the Meat Inspection (Fees) Orders and the Export Control (Fees) Orders. Decisions under subregulation 2B(2) and the Fees Orders have also been raised by the Minister for Justice and the Administrative Review Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the review of decisions under subregulation 2B(2), I am of the view that the same considerations apply as I have indicated above in relation to decisions concerning the remission or refunding of charges under subregulation 6(8) of the Regulations. As for decisions under the Meat Inspection (Fees) Orders, consideration is being given to amending the review provisions contained in Part 6 of the Orders, in particular suborder 31.1, to take account of, amongst other things, concerns raised by the Minister and the Council. Decisions under the Export Control (Fees) Orders are presently subject to ultimate review by the Administrative Review Tribunal by virtue of the application, under order 19 of those Orders, of Part 20 of the Prescribed Goods (General) Orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to the Minister for Justice also in the above terms.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to confine my remarks this afternoon to the response to the recommendations on Norfolk Island. I was extremely disappointed with the response. I shall point out why in a moment. I was pleased that at least the government agreed with the recommendation that the area known as Kingston, a very important part of Norfolk Island historically, be excluded from consideration as a potential site for any new harbour or freight handling infrastructure on Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made one recommendation on ships that I believe should have been supported. It was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth make available a grant equivalent to the Ships Capital Grant for the purchase of an Australian built vessel, smaller than would otherwise qualify for the Ships Capital Grant, on condition that any proposed vessel would be used principally on the Norfolk Island trade for at least the first two years following commissioning.</PARA>
<PARA>We did that because we found in our inquiry it was not reasonable or practical to build a large harbour. I do not have the time this afternoon to go through all of the matters that we looked at. This proposal related to putting out to tender a ship for the purpose of providing a service to Norfolk Island, knowing that at present there is a doubt about the ships presently servicing the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said that there are still union purchase ships available and that it is not a matter to worry about. The response was that they disagreed with this proposal, which would be the cheapest option, to do something practical for the island. The government response was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This recommendation was predicated on the assumption that union purchase vessels would soon not be available to service Norfolk Island. As these vessels will continue to visit the island for the foreseeable future there is not the same degree of urgency to provide a replacement service; rather, there is still time to consider all options in detail.</PARA>
<PARA>Fairyland! There has been a problem since the beginning of the century in servicing Norfolk Island. This was an opportunity to do something practical about it, at a cost that was reasonable for the number of people involved. I cannot believe that this has happened again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to some parts of the report which set out some of the history. Paragraph 5.6 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Norfolk Island has suffered severely in the past through the defective opportunities which nature has supplied for the safe and speedy access from ships to shore . . . It is certain that unless some substantial improvements can be effected, the probabilities of the expansion of trade in the future will be seriously lessened.</PARA>
<PARA>Trade and tourism, I add to that. You might think that is a statement made recently. That is not so. That was made in a report to this parliament in 1914. It identified the lack of harbour facilities as a factor which had inhibited enterprise and trade on Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A royal commission was conducted in 1975-76. Mr Justice Nimmo inquired into the constitutional relationship, which resulted in a measure of self-government being granted to Norfolk Island in 1979. He reported on a number of things, including air services, the state of the airport, the constitution, et cetera. One of his recommendations was that the construction of a small boat harbour facility be investigated. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The physical difficulties which would be encountered in constructing a worthwhile harbour at Norfolk Island would be enormous, and the cost of undertaking such construction would be prohibitive, both in absolute terms and also when weighed against the benefits received . . . However . . . one should take care to distinguish between such a seaport on the one hand and a small boat harbour on the other.</PARA>
<PARA>How many reports do we need? In 1979 a measure of self-government was given to Norfolk Island and responsibilities were handed to the Norfolk Island government without doing anything about the infrastructure which enables them to get access to goods and passengers to the island. I believe it is our responsibility to do something about that, but not in terms of a grand harbour. We do not recommend that. We made a recommendation which would give some assistance to enable a firm to acquire a ship which could do this task. This was the cheapest possible option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was general agreement, as is reported in paragraph 5.37, that infrastructure for unloading passengers and freight by sea on Norfolk Island was primitive and in poor repair, which in turn prevented Norfolk Island from obtaining modern shipping services. It was apparent the Norfolk Island government could not afford to fund the substantial new port infrastructure. The chief minister said, and he is quoted in our report, on the question of freight handling facilities, `It is fair to say that we have been hampered for lack of funds.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet another report comes to this parliament. Yet again the government has failed to recognise its responsibilities to do anything and puts it off. The first report was in 1914 and here today we get this response from the government which says, `Rather there is time to consider all options in adequate detail.' How many more decades have to pass before something is done to rectify this situation? I could scarcely believe it when I read that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government agrees to recommendation No. 22 in principle. It disagrees with the other recommendation which we believed was significant to enable things to happen more freely with Norfolk Island, that was to get rid of the export clearance numbers that operate at present. The government has rejected this proposal as well. I think that is a pity and unimaginative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also made a recommendation in relation to Australia Post, about the increase in prices of parcels to Norfolk Island. Parcels by post to Norfolk Island are part of the lifeblood of the place and, again, the government disagreed with that recommendation. It seems to me that the government either does not quite know what happens on Norfolk Island, what life is like there, or does not care. I am extremely disappointed that even if the government had not agreed to the precise recommendations that we have made, it has not even seemed to have recognised that there are things that need to be done on Norfolk Island in relation to its survival&mdash;getting goods and services there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard evidence of occasions when they virtually ran out of perishable things. It is certainly important to its future that it gets tourists to the place in greater numbers than at present. Norfolk Island suffered enormously during the pilots strike and that has not really been compensated for. The air services are not as good as they could be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think generally those who read this report will be very disappointed with the government's response and its failure to recognise that the time has come to do something about access to Norfolk Island rather than putting it off again. It will not be that long before it is 2014. I would hope that it would not be 100 years between the first report to this parliament about the needs of the island and some adequate response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on a couple of government responses to the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Delivering the Goods</EMPHASIS>. First of all, I just want to briefly refer to recommendations Nos 3, 4 and 5 which relate to shipping into all of the external territories&mdash;Norfolk, Christmas and Cocos&mdash;but particularly in relation to Christmas and Cocos islands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that the government is not blinkered or limited by its very close connections with the union movement in relation to shipping to Christmas and Cocos islands. It is essential that a shipping service is provided to Christmas and Cocos that serves both islands and serves them both effectively and at the least possible cost. The committee took evidence from a number of interested parties who all indicated that they could provide a good service, an efficient service and a cost-effective service to both Christmas and Cocos provided the government did not stand in their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was one of the reasons why the committee recommended that tenders be called and expressions of interest sought in relation to providing a service without cabotage applying to the service. The evidence given to us by almost all of the people interested in this aspect suggested that the existence of cabotage was the factor prohibiting operators from providing a cost-effective service to Christmas and Cocos islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that both islands be served. I understand that the government is currently encouraging an operator from Darwin of all places to the Indian Ocean territories but only doing Christmas Island, not the Cocos islands. That will leave Cocos without a regular and reliable form of freight into the island. I do express my regret that the government has not been prepared to pick that up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does say, in its response to recommendation 3&mdash;whilst acknowledging in its response to recommendation 2 that there is strong community support to include the scenario where Christmas Island is exempt from cabotage&mdash;that the federal government has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting existing cabotage arrangements. I think that is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does go on to say that they support the single voyage permit system, which does exist, and also point out that arrangements under the act presently exist for the issue of coasting trade licences and single voyage permits, as I have mentioned. They say that that provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate current options. I want to emphasise that because I suggest that it would be most inappropriate if the government, having supported the issue of trade licences and single voyage permits, at some stage gets pressured by the unions to re-look at those things because the unions are not getting what they want out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the government did not take a more pro-active approach to the question of cabotage. In that regard, I finally say that the essential thing is that the people of Cocos and Christmas islands do have a reliable, efficient and relatively inexpensive means of getting their freight to the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving the shipping matter, I refer to the responses to recommendation 12, where the committee recommended that Cocos island's cooperative society be reconstituted under Australian law. I am pleased to see that the government has agreed with that. It is only sensible. The sooner the cooperative is brought under Australian law and can be dealt with, audited and monitored under Australian law rather than Singaporean law, under which it presently exists, the better will be the people of Cocos islands and the people who have to rely on the services that the cooperative provides at Cocos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also agreed with the committee's recommendation 13 regarding an inquiry into legal status, ownership and economic power of the co-op and its links with the Cocos Keeling shire council. I have expressed concern that the members of the board of the co-ops are almost identical to the members of the Cocos shire council. I cannot claim to be an expert under West Australian local government law, under which the shire now operates, but certainly under Queensland that would have had a fairly substantial conflict of interest concern in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is the case, without putting too strong a point on it, that the Cocos island cooperative is really the principal commercial organisation on the island and it is also almost one and the same as the council. It does mean that people wanting to set up in competition&mdash;people with a different view of how to run commercial life on Cocos island&mdash;find it very difficult. I am pleased to see that the government is prepared to look at that a bit closer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that impacted upon most committee members when we landed on Cocos was that it is a magnificently pretty series of atolls. The other thing to hit us was the number of coconut trees on the island. There is a recommendation that we should see whether we can do something with the coconuts&mdash;maybe get some coconut oil extracted. The government has disagreed with the specific recommendation made. I suppose it has gone halfway by saying that it will investigate the extraction of coconut oil as a commercial activity to give some employment and wealth creation prospects to the people of Cocos island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 19 the committee referred to the purchase of an amphibious landing vessel and the ownership of that. Particularly in relation to Cocos, but also in Christmas, the government has to be very careful that if it has the interests of the inhabitants at heart, it has to make sure that there is no conflict of interest between the stevedores, the people who load and unload and distribute goods, and to make sure that they always act in a way that is in the best interests of the people of those islands. There is a suggestion that the stevedores are in many instances representatives of the co-op and there is preference given in pricing and timing to freight which belongs to the cooperative to the detriment of other person's freight. I think it is important that with any new landing vessels, the ownership and the capacity to work should be very carefully considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid also referred to recommendation 26, in which the committee recommended that the requirement for export clearance numbers for supplies sent from mainland Australia to the external territories be abolished without any change to their duty-free status. In its response the government has disagreed with this recommendation, claiming that the cost of doing this is not really their fault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overwhelmingly, the evidence given to the committee was that these export clearance numbers did not seem to serve a purpose that could not be achieved in some other way, but they did add very considerably to the cost of freighting goods not only to Norfolk Island but also to the Indian Ocean territories as well. I am disappointed that in that regard the government was not prepared to pick up the recommendations of the committee. I generally support those comments made by Senator Reid in relation to many of the other responses to the recommendations of the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This response is timely. I had intended to ask Senator Collins a question today if he had been here in relation to this very matter. I was going to refer Senator Collins to the recent controversy regarding the shipping service to the Cocos and Christmas islands. I would have referred him to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>dated 25-26 November 1995, which was entitled `Union plot to sink Cocos shipping'. In that article the Minister for Transport in Western Australia accused the federal government of lobbying for Darwin to service the islands and said that the Maritime Union had been doing the government's dirty work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions I was going to put to the minister were: could the minister confirm or deny whether any Keating government ministers had been involved in lobbying for Darwin to service Christmas and Cocos islands? Furthermore, was the minister aware of the preference of the people of both islands that the current dedicated island service, that is, Cocos Traders, remain operating from the traditional port of Fremantle in Western Australia? I might add that any transfer of the shipping service from Perth to Darwin would result in a loss in the region of $55 million to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was further going to ask: has the government done any comparison of the adequacy of the services and benefits to the community offered by the two competing services operating from Darwin and Perth respectively? It is my belief it would be more cost-effective to operate from Fremantle than from Darwin as, for a start, there would not be the problem with freight that goods in Darwin would experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also would have asked the minister to investigate and act upon claims by the Western Australian Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, that the maritime union was being used industrially to close the shipping service currently operating between Western Australia and the islands. The Cocos traders have operated between Fremantle and the Cocos and Christmas islands since the state shipping service ceased earlier this year. They have been operating very well, I believe, in the interests of people on both islands. Unfortunately, it looks as though the Cocos traders will not be given a single-voyage permit for the month of December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the federal government has been involved in lobbying for the Darwin service. I refer to a draft set of minutes from the Christmas Island Chamber of Commerce dealing with a meeting held on 9 October 1995 where the chairman indicated that a meeting had been held with Mr Warren Snowdon, the government member for the Northern Territory, on 12 September 1995. There were others in attendance. At this meeting the chamber had raised the shipping issue. It was reported that Mr Snowdon had stated that from information he had received `we could forget utilising a Clunies-Ross vessel' as it would not leave the port of Fremantle and he would be surprised if it was worked by Christmas Island stevedores. That points to a federal government involvement in treating preferentially a competing service. I note that in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that I mentioned, Mr Snowdon said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are about is trying to provide competition in the marketplace and a cost-effective service to Christmas and Cocos islands.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the government to do just that. I ask the government also to have regard to the wishes of the people on both Cocos and Christmas islands and give the Cocos traders a fair go in their submission to carry on conducting this service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also question whether the competing service will offer a regular service to the Cocos Islands or whether it will be more of a regular service to Christmas Island alone. I think that is a very important point. It was raised in the committee's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Delivering the goods</EMPHASIS>. Freight and shipping are vital to these two islands and the government has a responsibility to look after the interests of the people on both those islands. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">INTRODUCTION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991, the committee requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide terms of reference for an inquiry examining Australia's relations with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), highlighting those aspects of Australia's relations with them which would be in Australia's long term economic and trade interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry's terms of reference were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Australia's relationship with the World Bank and IMF and the opportunities for Australia's participation in Bank and Fund projects, highlighting those aspects which would be in Australia's long term economic and trade interests.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public hearings were conducted in 1992 and 1993 and the committee's Report was tabled in the Senate on 30 September 1993. The Report made thirty-two recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government welcomes the committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The World Bank and the IMF were established under the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 to help in post-war economic reconstruction and development (the World Bank) and in restoring and monitoring international monetary stability (the IMF).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisations have played a central role in global economic development and in international monetary affairs. Over the past fifty years, the World Bank and the IMF have become important sources of multilateral financial and technical assistance and economic advice to developing countries. They are leaders in debates on international monetary and economic issues (the IMF) and on development issues (the World Bank) and both have considerable research activities relating to finance and development. They assist developing countries in designing and implementing social and economic policies that seek to promote development in ways that are outward-looking and consistent with the development of open international trade and financial systems. The Fund and Bank are important catalysts in mobilising private and official capital for investment in developing countries. In recent years, the World Bank has been giving priority to reducing poverty and to addressing social and environmental aspects of development. Both the Fund and Bank are active in assisting the economies in transition in Eastern and Central Europe which are in the process of moving from centrally planned to market based economic systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither organisation has been without its critics. They have been criticised for the conditions they have agreed with recipient countries for the provision of assistance (particularly economic conditions, such as monetary and fiscal targets). They have also been criticised for not requiring that projects or programs take more account of social and environmental factors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some projects and programs have indeed been less than they might have been. However, it is also important to note that the outcomes of programs assisted by the Fund and Bank depend not only on the terms of assistance agreed by the organisations with governments, but on the effectiveness of implementation by those governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisations are important to Australia for their support of sustainable economic growth and outward looking economic policies, globally and within Asia and the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant proportion of Australia's total aid expenditure goes to the World Bank. In 1994-95, around 11 per cent of Australia's official development assistance was provided to multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Australia's financial contribution to the capital resources of the World Bank and the IMF has been supplemented, in the case of the World Bank, by substantial voluntary contributions to the concessional lending arm of the World Bank, the International Development Association, which provides funds on highly concessional terms to the world's poorest countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the committee reported, the government has agreed to contribute $A30 million, over an extended period beginning 1997-98, to subsidise the provision of funds for structural adjustment programs to the poorest countries on highly concessional terms by the IMF, through the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). The government's decision to contribute to the enlarged ESAF is in recognition of the useful role ESAF has played in improving the economic performance of some of the poorest countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through our membership of the World Bank, Australian businesses have opportunities to supply goods and services procured by operations of the Bank. Australia also benefits from its annual consultations with the Fund under Article IV arrangements, when the Fund provides advice to the government on Australia's economic policy stance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through helping to create improved policy environments in developing countries in Asia and the Pacific, both organisations complement, directly and indirectly, the effectiveness of Australia's bilateral aid program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers it important to monitor the operations of the Bank and Fund on an ongoing basis to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(+)that they use their resources in an efficient and effective manner, both administratively and operationally, to ensure the best value for the scarce development dollar;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(+)that their operations are effective `on the ground' in terms of sustainable development impact;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(+)that World Bank policies are consistent with Australia's development concerns, particularly in the areas of economic policy advising, in poverty reduction, the environment, and social and human resource development, including the role of women in development;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(+)that the Fund promotes international financial stability and economic growth;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(+)that Fund supported programs take account of wider social considerations, such as by the incorporation of "safety nets";  and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(+)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">that Australia is able to take full advantage of procurement opportunities in projects assisted by the Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, Australia's Governors to the Bank and Fund have taken an active role in the organisations' activities; this is supported by the Executive Directors representing Australia on the Executive Boards of both organisations. This involvement is the main channel for the continuing support and guidance that Australia provides to the Bank and Fund. The government draws substantially on its departmental resources, particularly in the Treasury, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Agency for International Development and the Environment Protection Agency for supporting these activities. Furthermore, it welcomes the interest taken and advice provided by non-government organisations in the operations of the Bank and the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the committee's recommendations are directed to ensuring that the organisations more effectively meet Australia's objectives. For these reasons, and in the context of ongoing monitoring of the Bank and Fund activities, the government welcomes the Report of the committee and endorses many of its recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA>It is very important that we look at this. The joint committee observed that a number of submittees to it were concerned that many of the structural adjustment programs were having a deleterious effect on the poorest of the poor. This is one thing that has concerned me, quite frankly, about structural adjustment programs. It is not only the absolutist economic rationalist approach that is sometimes taken by some people in these organisations; it is also the fact that the cost burden and the taxation burden are unduly weighted on the poorest of the poor, either indirectly, through increased costs of commodities&mdash;basic commodities such as food, clothing, shelter and so on&mdash;or in regard to the taxation system itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this because the structural adjustment programs and policies that are developed by the World Bank are also adopted by the Asian Development Bank. Honourable senators will recall that we have paid $69 million to the structural adjustment program, the ADB program, for Papua New Guinea. The question is: what will be the outcome of those structural adjustment policies? In respect of direct taxation, this can only be imposed on land, labour and capital. The structural adjustment programs appear to be unwilling to target capital. I suppose in one way that is probably understandable because capital is a moving target. People who do have the capital can go offshore. But more attention should be given to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, they will tax labour, but mainly pay as you earn. That is one of the reasons why there is a drop in earnings in a number of these situations, particularly amongst the pay as you earn workers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from those two aspects, there is only one other to be considered, that is, land. In my view the structural adjustment programs do not deal effectively with taxation on land. I was speaking recently to a person who was very much involved in the area of international banking who happens to live in Manila. When I raised it with that person he said, `Yes, I do live in a fairly up-market suburb of Manila and we pay a pittance in taxation on land.'

Indirect taxes do not present a moving target. They are can be imposed, but they are imposed unequally on the poor. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My sole reason for standing is to draw attention to the report. It was to report on the progress that the Commonwealth has made in the implementation of the act in its own instrumentalities.

We discovered during estimates that, with all the fanfare that went on in relation to this act&mdash;and we certainly support the act&mdash;the major deficiency was the employment of disabled people within the Commonwealth government's own departments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This Audit Office audit of the results of the 1994-95 financial statements audits of Commonwealth entities covers, as the title indicates, the whole range of Commonwealth reporting. It is useful because you get a view of a trend&mdash;and, fortunately, it is an improving trend&mdash;in financial accounting by Commonwealth entities. For example, this report indicates that inadequate accounts and records resulted in audit qualifications in only three Commonwealth entities. Nonetheless, more than 1,500 recommendations were made to management across a fair range of matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that the incidence of qualified audit reports issued has continued to decline, and in 1994-95 represents only about four per cent of all audit reports issued. Nonetheless, there are some matters that concern me, in particular the summary of risk assessments in this document. The comfortable feeling I got when reading the summary of the report about how things were improving disappeared a little. For example, in the Department of Defence it is evident that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has developed fraud control measures which require modifications to meet current organizational requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>If they need modification, I hope the government will do something about them because the Auditor-General, in the detailed part of this report, indicates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has advised that the existing Fraud Control Plan is of limited relevance because of continuing organizational and structural change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant matters reported to the Department for prompt attention&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by the audit office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">included management and accounting for assets, inventories and employee entitlements and recording of guarantees and undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA>This is of some substance, because the department has in-service inventories valued in excess of $3.6 billion, all of which are recorded on manual systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other department that concerned me&mdash;I can deal only briefly with each department&mdash;was the Department of Human Services and Health. It was reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department was in the process of finalising a comprehensive risk assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>After all this time, one wonders why it is in only the process of doing it and why in fact it has not actually done it. The risk of fraud is enormous. One would hope that this Auditor's report will encourage the department to proceed at pace with this. I will deal shortly with the Department of Human Services and Health in relation to another audit report, so I will not go on about it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Australian Customs Service, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk management activities, while critical to its achievement of revenue collection goals, have not had a clear strategic and corporate focus despite the contributions made within the agency.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a serious matter because the Australian Customs Service has an annual activity base estimated at $24 billion. The Auditor-General notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current version of the Fraud Control Plan was devised in 1993 and is due for review.</PARA>
<PARA>But even under that plan there was `no assessment made of the risks to revenue of the export of goods out of Australia'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Diversion into home consumption or substitution of transhipped or underbond goods reported to ACS as being intended for export could potentially have a significant revenue loss effect. The ANAO considers that ACS has not properly assessed the risks that the export of goods in these categories poses to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to areas of revenue forgone, the Auditor-General concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to passenger motor vehicle manufacturing and textile clothing and footwear concessions, risk management processes were in need of review.</PARA>
<PARA>Another matter of concern within the Customs Service was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO noted improvements in password controls in 1994-95. However, weaknesses were still apparent in respect of control over utility programs which have the capability of overriding or bypassing system security features. In addition, utility programs were not being properly controlled across a number of systems. ACS advised of remedial procedures which were designed to overcome the security concerns noted.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know about the significance and the consequences of people breaking into allegedly secure computer systems. It is of major concern to find that these systems of the Australian Customs Service, where, as I said, something like $24 billion of revenue is involved, are capable, apparently, of significant improvement before they can be seen to be as safe as they should be. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These procedures will ensure that access to powerful utility programs will only be provided under supervision in emergency situations.</PARA>
<PARA>Another of the bodies that I must say I was concerned about when I read the summary of this report was ATSIC, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. It seemed to me the Auditor-General was dropping the ball a bit, unusually. All he said in this section was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission indicated a strong awareness of the need to manage risks.</PARA>
<PARA>That looks like weasel words for saying they do not have a system. I would have hoped that a stronger position might have been taken, particularly when we look at the text of the report and find that in 1994-95 ATSIC's operating expenses were $951 million, its operating revenue was $37 million and the Commonwealth forked out $940 million. It is a lot of bickies. Look at how badly some of it seems to be administered, according to the Auditor-General. For example, in relation to the community development employment program, CDEP, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reviews undertaken at regional offices identified a high number of instances where supporting documentation for new participants could not be located. This lack of supporting documentation raised doubts as to whether all payments made by the Commission in relation to CDEP were in respect of eligible participants.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely essential that you should know whether the people you are paying money to are the people you are supposed to be paying money to. That seemed a very soft way in which the Auditor-General dealt with this matter at the beginning of this report. On the issue of grant acquittals, the Auditor-General says this of ATSIC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although some improvement was noted in relation to the acquittal of 1993-94 grants, excessive delays in the provision of adequate acquittal documentation by many grantee organisation remains a problem. The Commission has engaged a consultant to investigate the acquittal process and a report on the results of this investigation is expected shortly.</PARA>
<PARA>I have asked several questions in Senate estimates hearings about this matter of acquittal, and I am still awaiting appropriate responses. These matters are of some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a different department: the Australian Taxation Office. I must say I would have expected everything to be Simon Pure in relation to this department. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk management strategies were soundly based and aligned with corporate objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>But then the report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accountability for risk management practices and reporting on taxation revenue will require ongoing review.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, that seems to me like the sorts of words you use when the system is not good enough&mdash;that is, if you are being very friendly and do not want to say that the system is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Auditor-General for the report. It is most useful material and once again continues the Australian National Audit Office's outstanding record of providing the parliament with the information which it should have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is also an interesting audit report. It is a shame that former Senator John Coulter is not here to deal with it because he had great concerns about some matters relating to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory and its sale. I am particularly concerned about some elements of it, and I want to deal with them here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I should mention the sorts of problems the Auditor-General mentions. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Insufficient information was available to the ANAO to determine whether the issue of indemnities to CSL&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>by the Commonwealth government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">outweighed the financial and supply risks that the Commonwealth would have been exposed to if other options had been pursued.</PARA>
<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no quantitative assessment of the potential liability of the Commonwealth for product indemnities provided to CSL pre-or-post sale.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DHSH did not provide a documented briefing to the then Minister before committing to the PFA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the plasma fractionation agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Public reporting of the outcome of the CSL sale was provided in press releases and commentary in Annual Reports of the DoF and the DHSH.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the Auditor-General when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For improved accountability reasons, the ANAO considers that the outcomes of major asset sales should be timely and comprehensively reported&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>one would hope to the parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">including the financial outcomes and full details of any ongoing Commonwealth commitments.</PARA>
<PARA>I say `Hear, hear' to all that. I know the government has not been too good at bringing its asset sales to completion. It keeps making huge alleged contributions to its budget from asset sales, but they rarely seem to turn up. This is one that actually did turn up, but we find that they have made a bit of a mess of it. There is a most extraordinary situation involved here which I would like to deal with. The audit report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . CSL was indemnified by the Commonwealth against claims by persons who become HIV-positive or contract an AIDS-related condition or hepatitis through the use of a CSL plasma or diagnostic product sourced from Australian blood or plasma and manufactured during the terms of the PFA and DPA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indemnities provided to CSL raise accountability issues, given the potential risk of future calls on Commonwealth budgets. The ANAO was advised that Cabinet did not specifically consider, nor was it formally advised of, the nature and scale of indemnities provided to CSL under the agreements signed in December 1993. DHSH advised the ANAO that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cabinet was aware of the indemnity issues when it took the decision to sell CSL. Comments provided by the Department of Finance and the Treasury and in recommendations/findings of the consultant to DHSH (contained in an attachment to the Cabinet Memorandum), raised the matter of the provision of Commonwealth indemnities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO considers that it would have been much more judicious to have fully briefed the DHSH Minister on the specific details of the agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DHSH advised the ANAO that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hansard statements by the then Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health . . . (Dr Theophanous) indicate that the Executive Government was aware of the indemnities issue&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>they were aware of the indemnities issue, but not the specifics of the indemnities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Dr Theophanous' case, he expressly supported the provision of indemnities by reading into the Hansard of 27 October 1993 the terms of a letter to CSL from the Departmental Deputy Secretary. Senator Richardson also raised the issue of indemnities in correspondence with Mr Peter Costello MP concerning the Commonwealth's position on the provision of an indemnity to CSL on CJD-related claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a major problem and one that former Senator Coulter raised in this place. The department went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The events referred to above occurred well before the execution of the plasma fractionation and diagnostics agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General expresses this further concern:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO noted a number of unique features concerning the indemnities which highlight the need for appropriate accountability processes. First, the size of CSL's exposure to legal claims is unknown.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a contingent liability in the budget which may be huge&mdash;who knows. He goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DHSH 1993-94 Notes to the Financial Statements state in relation to contingent liabilities that the Department was involved in 201 cases covering a wide range of litigation, including cases relating to the supply by CSL of blood products which were allegedly contaminated by the HIV/AIDS virus and relation to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). DHSH was unable to put a value on the quantum of damages arising from these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO found that DHSH did not commission any actuarial studies to quantify the potential liability of the Commonwealth for product indemnities pre or post sale.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that there are a lot of problems. The department did mention, for example, that the nature of the claims involve medical conditions which may not show up for a prolonged period and may involve future generations. In any event, the government has agreed that there should be a settlement of all Australian HIV/AIDS claims. That decision has been made for reasons of public policy although CSL has not been found negligent in any of the actions which have proceeded to court. However, what is the cost of all this? The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to the Commonwealth for HIV/AIDS claims between 1989-90 and 1994-95 amounted to $28.6 million. The Commonwealth agreed to contribute to these costs provided that it was consulted and agreed to the settlement or defence of each claim and that each claim was individually assessed for its legal validity. There have been no reports of the transmission of AIDS-related conditions through blood products since the introduction of viral inactivation steps in 1984. Claims in respect of hepatitis are possible.</PARA>
<PARA>The report states further:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO considers that the Commonwealth could have been better protected through the utilisation of economic incentives on CSL to adopt quality and safety measures above mandatory standards, as CSL will bear the full costs. If the status quo position is maintained, the Commonwealth may potentially bear the costs of litigation arising from any shortcomings in current processes.</PARA>
<PARA>Finance says that it is in CSL's best interests not to let that happen. I found this report into the sale of CSL and this question of indemnities to be very important. This certainly should provide a lesson to other Commonwealth bodies that are being sold off. When the coalition is in government we will examine very closely the implications of this report when we come to implement an asset sales program which is to be run competently and effectively and as indicated rather than in the chaotic style employed by this government. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this schedule to the Senate follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Senate has been taken as the date that the response is presented, not the date of any correspondence with the committee. Senate legislation committees are often required to </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P.J. KEATING, MP</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE FUTURE OF OUR FORESTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30 NOVEMBER 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, I seek leave of the House to make a Statement on forest policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, today I announce the Government's broad policy direction on Australia's forests and forest industries. I am also announcing several related initiatives vital to the future of our native forests and the industries which depend upon them. Full details of these measures will be released tomorrow by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, and the Minister for Resources. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, Australia's forests are a defining feature of our landscape, a priceless element of our environment and heritage, a national resource of immeasurable proportions&mdash;and a profound national responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Australians have a stake in these forests. All of us have a responsibility to insist that they are properly managed and carefully conserved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are a national treasure and their management must be ecologically sustainable and economically clever.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our native forests are of inestimable conservation value. They are vital repositories of biological diversity&mdash;indeed, new species of plants and animals are still being discovered. They are a haven for endangered species. They are vitally important as water catchments, they influence our climate and act as carbon sinks to limit the greenhouse effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as importantly they are places of unique and unrivalled beauty. They are aesthetically and spiritually important to us. They are important to our sense of belonging to this land. Our respect for and enjoyment of them is part of our communion with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the national interest quite simply demands that we protect our forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This same national interest also demands that we use the forests intelligently for the things we need and for the communities that live with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our forests have economic significance. They are an important renewable resource, contributing to the wealth of the nation, and providing us with essential commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many Australians, and many Australian communities, depend on our native forests for their livelihoods. Whatever we decide are our priorities, their interests must be attended to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This perception of an irresolvable conflict between the environmental and commercial values of forests has produced deep divisions in the Australian community. The debate presents itself as a conflict between absolutes: the absolute necessity to protect these priceless parts of our environment, and the absolute necessity to protect Australia's economic interests and the well-being of Australian working men and women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conflict is easily understood. No Australians want to see these forests destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Nor do they wish to see the economic interests of Australia damaged or the livelihoods of their fellow Australians threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We on the Government side number ourselves among these Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No policy is going to satisfy everyone. Neither side of this debate can expect to get everything they want. The aim is to see that Australia is the winner, that the Australians of the next century are the winners. In the end, the essential goal is the protection of the long term national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, it is towards this goal that the Government has steered a course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our cause will be greatly advanced if, on both sides, the debate is conducted with the national interest in mind. We should all remember that no-one in this conflict has a monopoly on truth or virtue, or a mortgage on concern for the future of our forests. Those who presume they do and claim it exclusively will only debilitate the efforts of people of good will to find the best solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recognise that this is a debate which will of its nature arouse great passions. But, equally the solutions and the path to them cannot be other than rational.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not find solutions without cool thinking and a genuine desire to find common ground and a degree of shared good will.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, if the task of devising a national forest policy which meets community expectations is made difficult by polarised opinion and emotion, it is made even more complex by the fact that, under our Constitution, the States have the primary responsibility for land management, including the management of our forests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many in the Australian community expect the Commonwealth to take more responsibility for Australia's forests than the Commonwealth has the ability to take. It is expected of the Federal Government that we develop an effective national policy, yet the Federal Government does not effectively have the power to do so. What powers we do have can never deliver the long term changes we are seeking&mdash;to the reserves, to sustainable management and to the industry&mdash;without the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recourse to the Commonwealth Government underlines the failure of interest groups to secure the appropriate undertakings from those who do manage forests in Australia and that, of course, is the State governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In lieu of actual powers, the Government has taken the lead in developing with the States a cooperative approach to managing and protecting our forests. This policy has depended upon the States recognising that there is a national interest to be served, and success in the long run will in large part depend upon the States continuing to recognise this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, we started on this difficult journey towards a common approach to forest management with the development of the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement, to which all State and Territory Governments are now signatories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was itself no easy matter&mdash;and some parties have only more recently joined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Embodied in that Statement are the shared economic, social and environmental objectives which all governments have made a commitment to achieving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the National Forest Policy Statement, the Commonwealth and the States agreed to the ecologically sustainable management of Australia's forests. Realising that we did not know enough about our forests, the Statement provided the basis for thorough, cooperative assessments of their values, leading ultimately to the concept of Regional Forest Agreements with the States. These Agreements offer the real possibility of a long term framework for the protection and management of these important national assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an idea it is probably unique in the developed world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Policy provides for the development of a National Forest Reserve System, which would ensure the protection of high conservation value areas required to maintain biodiversity, old growth and wilderness values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year, the Commonwealth through a panel of scientists, developed  a set of criteria for determining which areas should become a part of this system. They include;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a broad benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-European distribution of each forest type to be protected within the reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">retention in reserves of at least 60 per cent of existing old growth, increasing up to 100 per cent wherever practicable for rare old growth</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">protection of 90 per cent or more wherever practicable, or areas of high quality wilderness</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These criteria are recognised as at the leading edge in world terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, Mr Speaker, before we can arrive at a position from which we can negotiate Regional Forest Agreements and, through them, a comprehensive, adequate and representative National Forest Reserve System, we must put in place interim protection measures for forests which might be required as components of such a reserve system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The device we are using for this is a Deferred Forest Area or DFA process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deferred Forest Areas process has been designed to provide the appropriate degree of interim protection needed for the longer term RFAs. It is not meant to be the last word on which areas would be logged and which would be turned over to forest reserves. Rather, it was meant to provide an essential building block on the way to Regional Forest Agreements. The decisions to be announced tomorrow therefore, are but the first step in a longer, more rigorous process. But for the forests, a giant step.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For most of this year, the Commonwealth has been negotiating with New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and Western Australia to identify forest areas to be protected pending further assessment in the development of Regional Forest Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cooperation with these Governments, the Commonwealth has recently concluded a very extensive consultation process in which interested individuals and groups have had their say in an open and transparent process. Through their contribution they have been able to influence the outcome and, I am pleased to say, our Deferred Forest Areas are the better for it. At the same time, I believe, these consultations have underlined the fact that the policy approach we have chosen is undoubtedly the right one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the Deferred Forest Areas process, we have delivered a positive and I stress immediate outcome for all Australians who have a stake in our forests&mdash;which is to say, albeit to varying degrees, every Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a first step, the decisions we have taken this week offer sound conservation outcomes as well as predictability for our forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have taken a precautionary approach, so as to ensure that future reservation options are kept open.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cabinet has agreed on the areas of state forest to be deferred. Detailed maps of these areas will be released tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our objective has been to ensure that options for establishing the reserve system, based on criteria developed by the Commonwealth are not foreclosed while longer term assessments are conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, I am confident that we have achieved this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the next few weeks, the Commonwealth expects to sign Deferred Forest Agreements with the States I have mentioned. I will be writing to the Premiers later today inviting them to enter these Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have on a number of occasions talked about creating in Australia a forest reserve system the equal of any in the world. With the signing of these agreements, we will have taken a huge step towards this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the management of those parts of the forest estate outside the reserve system is just as important as the reserves themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to ensuring that the management of these areas, some of which will be available for harvesting, is truly sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the longer term process, we will be joining with the States in a thorough review of forest management and codes of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our aim is to ensure that the full range of values we attach to our forests are maintained in perpetuity. We must adopt the view that these precious assets are held in trust for the future, they are not ours to neglect or degrade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forests industry should be a model of ecologically sustainable development. Our objective is to ensure that it is.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the annual turnover of Australia's wood and paper industry based on native forests and plantations, is in the order of $10 billion, or about one per cent of Gross Domestic Product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes it is imperative to have a viable wood and wood products industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investments of between $4 billion and $6 billion are at present under consideration. Industry and unions predict between 15,000 and 25,000 potential new jobs over the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The associated Wood and Paper Industry Strategy also to be released tomorrow sets out the Government's long term vision for this industry. It is the Government's aim to transform it&mdash;to make it both internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of this transformation, we will encouraging increased investment in value-adding processes for wood and wood pulp, and give priority in issuing woodchip export licences to applicants who invest in domestic processing. We are determined to sharply improve domestic value-adding of residues currently being exported as unprocessed woodchips. We will, through this industry, expand job opportunities in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will clear the way for value-adding to forest residues by the release of strict environmental standards for Bleached Eucalypt Kraft pulpmills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And through Regional Forest Agreements to be developed with State Governments, we will provide industry with increased assurance about resource supply and greater regulatory certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue to remove duplication in environmental impact assessment processes at the Federal and State levels and reduce administrative and compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through AusIndustry, we will provide additional funding for enterprise development to firms in the wood and paper industries, and so promote best practice and competitive efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will provide additional assistance to small and medium firms in the wood and paper industry who are seeking to move into new markets or upgrade existing facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And through the Wood and Paper Industry Council, we will develop industry sector approaches to investment and improved import replacement and export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Underlying all of these initiatives is a fundamental commitment to sustainable job growth and opportunities for Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, while the Government is committed to the long-term sustainability and prosperity of the native forest based industry, special recognition will also be given to the increasingly important role of plantations and farm forestry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These sectors represent the best sources for future growth in the wood and paper industry. Plantations already supply a significant proportion of our total wood and paper products and major value-adding investment proposals are currently under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995, the industry set a target of trebling the current plantation resource by 2020. The Government supports and welcomes this initiative. It will act to remove impediments to plantation establishment and establish a policy environment which will help industry to realise this target.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, every effort has been made to minimise necessary disruption to the timber industry arising from the Deferred Forest Areas process. State Governments have been asked to re-schedule logging operations away from deferred areas. However, the Government recognises that in some cases re-scheduling may not be possible and that logging operations will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Wood and Paper Industries Strategy contains details of a generous Structural Adjustment Package which will provide financial and other assistance, including retraining, to proprietors and workers in the timber industry, those detrimentally affected by the Deferred Forest Areas process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, we are especially conscious of the disruptive effect on some operators and communities of these changes. We will do all that we can reasonably do to help.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, let me turn to the vexed question of the woodchip export licences. Applications for woodchip exports for this year were about nine million tonnes. However, as indicated last year the Government wants to reduce the amount of wood exported in this unprocessed form. The Government has therefore decided on a much lower volume for this year which will be 5.25 million tonnes. This amount is a fair and consistent down payment on that objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licences will be issued for 80 per cent of that volume. The remaining 20 per cent will only be available in regions where there has been significant progress towards Regional Forest Agreements with State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of this year's ceiling will be announced tomorrow by the Minister for Resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has made a commitment to phasing out woodchips exports by the year 2000 from areas not covered by Regional Forest Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We remain committed to diverting these exports into further domestic value-adding. The industry is on notice that unless we get the progress and the agreements, woodchip exports will be phased out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those on the extremes of the debate&mdash;in the timber industry and among their more uncompromising opponents&mdash;should understand that the Government will not waver from this course or these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, no Australian government has ever made such a conscientious attempt to resolve this huge and vexed issue. Most governments would run a million miles from it. We have been at pains to strike the right balance; to find the means by which environmental and economic necessities can be reconciled in the national interest; the means by which a profitable industry and prosperous communities can be reconciled with our responsibility to preserve a unique and magnificent part of our natural heritage for our children and the Australians of the 21 century and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, it can be done. This statement demonstrates that driving an intelligent course can reap substantial and permanent benefits for both sides of the debate and for the nation&mdash;more substantial and more permanent than any we might derive from pursuing one direction to the exclusion of the interests of the others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The moral comfort of extreme and certain positions may be warming to those who hold them, but they do not confront the real moral challenge, to deliver real, worthwhile, lasting and democratic solutions. Ones that everyone can respect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, no-one should be under the illusion that with these decisions the difficulties and sensitivities surrounding the issue will disappear. Of course, they won't.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I hope the process will decidedly help to create a more cooperative and analytical environment. An environment in which the common goal of the protection and renewal of our forests can be achieved with a forest products industry that has a future based on sustainability and ecological decency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, this statement will bring us much much closer to ecologically sustainable management of our great forests. And, with it, much closer to meeting our responsibilities to the Australians of the next century and thereafter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we had, of course, was what you purported to be your policy that was brought down today. What we got was another vacuous statement from the Prime Minister. As Mr Howard pointed out in the other place, I thought so effectively, the difficult decisions in the forest area have been, as we always see with the Labor Party, flicked past the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How nice it was to hear Mr Keating complaining about the volume of woodchip exports from this country. Mr Keating expressed in his speech great concern about the volume of woodchip exports, but the reality is that Mr Keating is the champion woodchip exporter. If you pull out the figures, you find that no other government in Australian history has had policies which have effectively created and allowed such an extensive volume of woodchip exports. Most Australians, of course, would far rather see more of these woodchip exports processed on their own shores and value added here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intriguing that for some 13 years this government has held the levers in office. You would have thought that after 13 years we would have had a clear forest policy&mdash;a policy which gave Australians the confidence that there was a world-class reserve system being protected and gave the forest industry the confidence that they had a sustainable timber resource available to them to ensure security of supplies. But we had neither. So, after 13 years in government, they are still grappling around to create a policy so that most Australians can have confidence that their high conservation value forest has been protected and the timber industry can have confidence that they will have continuing supplies. And we did not get it today from the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have counted up and it seems to me that since last December we have had seven statements on the forest industry&mdash;seven statements from the Prime Minister and his ministers on the forest industry. I think all of us were hoping that maybe we were moving to a position where there would be greater certainty, where people would have confidence that at last some progress was being made. I think that is why Mr Keating's statement today was so disappointing, so vacuous, so full of general comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we get down to looking at the specifics there is even some doubt. Mr Keating in his statement said that the volume of woodchips would be cut this year. I checked with the forest industry, and their advice was that the volume of woodchips specified by Mr Keating in his statement for next year, of licences to be issued, is the same as the volume of woodchips which are being exported this year. So why not stand behind what you are doing? Why pretend to the public that you are doing something when, in fact, a most cursory look at the figures and a check with appropriate authorities shows that you are not doing it? I do not know who happens to advise Mr Keating on these matters, but I have to tell you that I think there will be considerable concern in the Australian community about the pretence that Mr Keating has put over this paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we needed above all from Mr Keating was some truth and frankness. No-one doubts in relation to forest policy issues that there are some difficult choices which have to be made and there are difficult balances which have to be achieved. No-one pretends that it is easy, but is it as hard as the Labor government has made it over 13 years? We have had, of course, occasional outbursts of peace in our time. In 1988 we had an MOU signed with the Tasmanian government, which Senator Sherry will remember, which was meant to deliver peace in our forests. In 1992, Senator Sherry, we had the national forest policy statement signed by all states, with the exception of Tasmania, which has since signed on. Again, that was meant to lead to a settlement in the forest industry. Today, of course, we have had another statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a self-evident truth that the great growth in the forest industry and the potential we have will largely come through farm forestry and plantations, yet the rate of plantation establishment in this country is amazingly low compared with other countries. Mr Keating and his advisers would have known this for a long period of time, so the problem is: why haven't we had the plantation establishment in this country that we are seeing, for example, in countries like New Zealand? One reason is that no-one has any confidence in any long-term policy in this country under a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has made the problem worse by its own politics. It has seen over the years that it can use the forests to divide people, so the debate has become hugely politicised. As I said earlier in my remarks, it was always going to be difficult because choices and balances have to be struck. Once you get out and you politicise it the way your Prime Minister has done it, no wonder it becomes even more difficult. So when things get too hot, you then try to pull it all back. But the trouble is, Senator Sherry, that your Labor Party in its approach, as I said, has so politicised the issue that the problem becomes immensely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were hoping today to get a very clear sign from Mr Keating on the general policy approach, which we hoped would lead to greater certainty in the industry, greater certainty amongst the conservationists and then the timber interests. I do not think we got that from the policy statement today. So the debate, unfortunately, will perhaps not go to a lower level, but will continue as people continue to look through the Prime Minister's statement, read between the lines and try to interpret just what he is trying to say. Mr Howard made an extensive reply to Mr Keating's speech in the House today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) today, all I can say is: let's hope the detail is a little bit better than today's statement leads us to expect. I begin with one point made by Senator Kemp&mdash;that woodchip volumes are not going to be decreased. Indeed, it looks as if it is the same as ever, onwards and onwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp raised another point, about why we are dragging the chain in regard to the number of plantations that we should be seeing in this country. I would suggest it is because this government continues to prop up our industry in the native forests. Of course, people are not going to invest in plantations, despite the fact that they grow far more quickly and are far more efficient, and it does mean that they are not as valuable as they should be because of the undercutting of their products by products that come out of our native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having listened to the Prime Minister's speech I can say that none of the Democrats' worries has been relieved in any way. We are still more than a little concerned that it will basically be the status quo with a little bit of trimming around the edges. It has not quelled our fears. While there were a lot of nice media grabs and very short, succinct statements, I do not think many in the conservation movement are going to be at all pleased with what has been said and what has been seen so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, the Prime Minister did talk about things like biodiversity, a national reserve system, restructuring of the industry and retention of high quality wilderness and old growth forests. But, of course, there was a qualifier, and this time the qualifier is, as the Prime Minister said, `where practicable'. Until we see the maps and see what precisely the government is talking about it is very difficult for us here to comment on whether we have any solutions in the long-term to those difficult problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely here in Australia&mdash;a first world country and a very wealthy country, where most people are at least reasonably well off&mdash;we can protect our forests. Surely it is completely practicable and morally correct. As far as workers' jobs are concerned, the real long-term jobs are in places like Mount Gambier in my home state. The forestry industry there is well and truly established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been proven that most of the sawlogs in this country are indeed already coming from plantation wood and that countries overseas are better at utilising trees grown from seed exported from here&mdash;our eucalyptus in plantations&mdash;than we have been. It has been proven over and over that the native forest sector is declining, that its debts are increasing and that the economics of plantations mean their use will inevitably eclipse native forests. Even with all the subsidies we have for native forests, the industry there has a limited life. An area I know very well is East Gippsland where the significant amount of remaining rain forests is largely outside any existing reserve system. Are we going to continue chipping and cutting our native forests to the point where there is simply none of that remaining?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree with a number of the statements that the Prime Minister made relating to how imperative it is and how important it is that we have good pulp and paper industry strategies here. Indeed, that is why the Democrats have personally now given the Prime Minister two copies of our wood products industry policy. But still we see no move on the part of the government to seriously support the plantation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also looking at value adding, and indeed it does far more value adding than the native forest industry does now. The Democrats are not convinced of the need to continue to export woodchips. It makes no economic sense and it certainly makes no ecological sense when we can see what is happening with our plantation timbers. They are already value adding, and value adding significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the financial status of the industry is not healthy. Consulting economist Francis Grey has identified 23 types of effective subsidies going to the native forest industry. This includes low royalties, state government subsidies, possible tax exemptions and loopholes, road building, various infrastructure supports, port facilities, forestry commission support, non-payment of monitoring fees et cetera. There are accusations of rorts and inefficiencies. Penalties are very rare, I know from visits to both East Gippsland and the wombat forest recently.  There, penalties are virtually non-existent despite blatant breaches of licence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report released by Dr Andrew Dragun, senior lecturer in law, economics and public policy at La Trobe University, found that the Victorian government spent $90 million on logging of the native forests for a return of $40 million. In other words, the Victorian taxpayer subsidised the industry to the tune of $50 million a year. Dr Dragun goes on to say that a reasonable estimate of the annual subsidy when all costs are taken into account could well be in the order of $385 million. So really, as he said, it is a form of a social welfare payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined debts of the forestry commissions across Australia are now over $5 billion. Some of those debts are welcome because they are actually helping to establish plantations. I point out the successes in my home state. It is only South Australia that has very little debt, and I argue that that is because we source 90 per cent of our sawlogs from softwood plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to John Dargavel from the ANU and statistics from the ABS and the census of population and housing, jobs in the wood and wood products industry have declined by 20,000 over the last 20 years. At the same time, there has been a substantial increase in wood production, showing that forestry protection has not resulted in declining production or employment. While some sections of the industry claim up to 80,000 people are employed, according to the 1991-92 ABS manufacturing and establishments data&mdash;the latest figures available&mdash;employment in the logging, saw-milling and pulp and paper manufacturing sections is approximately 35,000. Of this, only 613 were employed in woodchip plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy statement was supported by a wide cross-section of the forest industry. It was also signed by the state governments across Australia&mdash;with the exception initially of Tasmania, but they have since agreed&mdash;and it contains a recognition of conservation values. It contains this quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until the assessments are completed, forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Faulkner last year recommended that 1,300 coupes from those areas were likely to have old growth or wilderness value and should be investigated. The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) set aside only 85 of these areas. It was only after significant public outcry that this was eventually increased by 509, which comprises approximately five per cent of the 1995 concession area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy statement also demonstrated the intention to put in place a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system by 1995. It appears there have been no areas reserved under this scheme so far. Indeed, it will not be until we see some of the details tomorrow that we are really able to comment on that area at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it makes good economic sense to keep our native forests intact. Not only do they provide habitat, including for endangered species, but also they hold the soil together, provide organic matter and are used for ecotourism. Indeed they are crucial to the water catchment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here again I move to far East Gippsland. I hope, when we see the maps tomorrow and the detail, included will be the Betka river catchment area, which is the only water supply for the township of Mallacoota. If that is not included, then there is severe risk not only to the long-term population of Mallacoota but also to the tourism industry there. There have been a number of Christmas seasons already where water has run dangerously low. If we have the catchment area logged&mdash;it has already started to be logged&mdash;then we can see up to a 50 per cent reduction. Scientific tests have already been done to show that a considerable reduction in water volume is likely, as well as some major question marks over water quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A hectare of old growth mountain ash clear-felled may produce $270 of woodchips on a one-off basis. A generation later it may produce half as much because the regrowth, if anyone has had a look at what happens to these forests after they are logged, is very sparse. According to Read, Sturgess and Associates consulting economists commissioned by the Victorian government, if that same hectare is left unlogged it produces more than $6,000 worth of water year after year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few moments left to me I will just briefly again touch on the softwood market and the plantation industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful to the government for allowing this debate to continue and for giving up its time for us to respond to the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I actually felt that his statement was full of fine words. I did not quite agree with Senator Kemp that it was vacuous. On looking further at it, I realised that in a sense his assessment was closer to the truth than mine; because, essentially, the government has once again gazumped the coalition over a major policy initiative. The ALP has implemented an industry focused forest plan. Forest protection has just lost out; so, in that sense, it is rhetoric and it is vacuous. It was very fine and moving. I can imagine the office of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) contributing to the first half of the speech and the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) to the second half.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to what will be the outcome, clearly I am afraid that the plan the forest industry has before it will entrench woodchipping and be the phasing out of our old-growth and high conservation value forests, rather than being what all in the Australian community hoped for: that there be a genuine phase-out of woodchipping from our native forests, particularly those of high conservation value. Once again, just like the other rational economic agenda items of enterprise bargaining, privatisation, superannuation and international trade liberalisation, the ALP has stolen the conservative agenda out from underneath the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are indebted to Mr Howard for pointing out that the reduction of the woodchip exports, over which the Prime Minister shed crocodile tears, was not such a substantial reduction at all. So we are indebted to the coalition for at least observing that the government is not following its rhetoric with actions that would ensure the protection of our precious forest heritage. This is a disastrous result for both forest protection and the long-term interests of the industry and workers. Many will say that this is just the ongoing rhetoric of the Greens and the environment movement. But we keep saying it because the forests keep getting trashed. Nothing ever changes&mdash;just the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree entirely with Senator Meg Lees when she says that this is the status quo. I think in one sense it entrenches the status quo, which is that our forests are being chipped at enormous rates and are slowly disappearing; they will never be the same again. Regrowth is not the same as an old growth or a high conservation value forest. It becomes a monoculture; the diversity is lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 15 per cent reserve system based on a comprehensive, adequate, representative basis will not save the precious values that the community is asking the government to protect and show the necessary political will towards. What it does reveal is that the national forest policy, which it implements one step further, has always been and still is an unsatisfactory strategy. It always has been&mdash;and now we can see it&mdash;about entrenching woodchipping. It does not protect those precious values that the community sees being shipped out on enormous trucks. We see these great big logs going to the sawmill in the south-west of Western Australia, and we see the piles of woodchips at the Bunbury port. We also see it in other parts of Australia. People are horrified. It is a sacrilege to be doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no talk in the Prime Minister's statement of stopping woodchipping. All the talk is about entrenching woodchipping and just removing it from export to downstream processing within the country. That still ensures the utter disappearance of our high conservation value forests. We see, basically, that there are no restrictions on plantation based woodchipping. This just sets up the plantation industry to experience, in 10 years time, exactly the same problems that the native forest timber industry is experiencing now.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very minimal reductions, as I have said, in the woodchip quotas for next year, while opening it up to open slather woodchipping after the regional forest agreements are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another thing we should note today: Mr Keating has done a Pontius Pilate; he has washed his hands, once and for all, of the federal responsibility to intervene and protect the precious values of our native forests. He has abrogated that responsibility to the states. Not only that, but he did a mean thing in the sense that he blamed the conservation movement for not being able to bring the states around to see the need for protection from logging. He first blamed the conservation movement for not being able to negotiate with the states. Then he said that the federal government was not prepared to use its powers to overrule the wrong things that the states were doing and that the environment movement should have been able to stop the states from doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, Mr Keating is entrenching by the process called regional forest agreements that the states be given the authority, from now on, to approve the woodchip licences. That is a tragedy of mammoth proportions. It is one which is slowly dawning on those who are listening closely, beyond the rhetoric of the Prime Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are dismayed but not surprised with this being a bad decision; it has been the child of a bad process. There has been a forest auction going on&mdash;and, once again, it is the forests and our future that have missed out. Basically, the forests, which should have been our future, really have become the now of the wood products industry; that is what they have become. The government has shown today, beyond any doubt, that the national forest agreement is about entrenching woodchipping in Australia and not about the protection of our magnificent forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the government should have acted was reflected in the private senator's bill that I presented earlier this week. Our bill was a benchmark and a starting point. It is a way of assessing what the Commonwealth is prepared to do in terms of its genuine commitment for the forests. It should include the clear powers of the Commonwealth; instead of letting them go, they should be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has moved away from all three components of our bill. The first was a phase-out of woodchip exports; they would cease by the year 1998. In fact, our quotas were a four million tonne limit on export licences in 1996, two million in 1997, and then 1 January 1998 there would be a nil export of woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another component was that protection from logging apply immediately on woodchipping of forests with old-growth values, wilderness values, world heritage and national estate or interim register of national estate areas, rainforest or areas containing endangered species, as specified under state and federal laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not committed itself to a substantial reduction of export woodchipping. It has simply said that it will allow the states to keep doing it at the same level it is now occurring. It has not protected properly the qualities of the areas for which protection has been asked by the community. Also, its industry strategy is simply an industry strategy; it is not a transition strategy to assist those workers who will be genuinely disadvantaged if there were to be an act of political will to save high conservation value forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is a need for a transition strategy; there is no doubt that there are people who will require that assistance. But they will not require it on the basis of the statement which has now been put out by the Prime Minister. I think that is why the minister for environment has rejected the term `transition' when we talk about a transition strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the government could have acted, as I said, was set out in our bill. It has failed to do that. What it is doing will not solve the problems. Its smooth rhetoric will do little to reassure the community at large who have clearly shown where they stand: they do not want our precious old-growth forests turned into woodchips. The government stands condemned. They cannot be surprised when the consequences of their actions come home to roost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government has told us that it has been working at finding a solution for forests for the last 12 months and has spent thousands of dollars in the process. Indeed, a solution is at hand. But this government needs to take firm hold of the Native Forest Protection Bill as a model in one hand and Dr Judy Clarke's plantations study in the other. Only then will the government find a foothold on the first step out of the current bureaucratic morass to genuinely protect the last remaining old-growth forests, once and for all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TABLING STATEMENT BY SENATOR MARGARET REYNOLDS, CHAIRPERSON</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I am tabling today is the Committee's second report on the issue of the regulation of computer on-line services. Since holding an earlier inquiry in April 1995 the Committee has invited submissions in relation to the adequacy of current measures to control access by children to obscene, offensive or otherwise undesirable material through computer on-line services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received 37 informative submissions, which contained some 450 pages of evidence. Public hearings were held in Canberra in September and Sydney in October where the opportunity was taken to clarify many of the issues raised in the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Committee found was that material which would be refused classification in any other medium, such as in publications, films and computer games, can be found on-line. The Committee heard of there being depictions on-line of child pornography and bestiality which are banned imports into Australia under customs controls and are refused classification if presented to the Office of Film and Literature Classification. Witnesses stressed to the Committee that such material represents only a very small part of the total volume of material available on-line. However, the Committee takes the view that in the maintenance and protection of community standards action should be taken to ensure that otherwise refused or restricted material should not be available to children on-line.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly the Committee has recommended that it should be an offence to use a computer service to transmit, obtain possession of, demonstrate, advertise or request the transmission of material equivalent to the "Refused Classification" category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also gave consideration to the issue of children gaining access on-line to material equivalent to the "R" and "X" categories to which their access is restricted in other media. It is a feature of many on-line services that, once connected, all information is available to all customers in the same way that, once broadcast, all television is accessible to all viewers. The Committee has given consideration to the likely effectiveness of on-line controls on children's access to restricted material based on its observations in the past of the fallibility of similar controls in the provision of audiotex and pay TV services. The Committee has concluded that the main control is prohibition at source and it has recommended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that while regulation of material sourced within Australia can be subjected to Australian law, such on-line services as the Internet are of such a global nature that their regulation in Australia is necessarily limited by jurisdictional constraints. Unlike publications, films and computer games, which can be deemed to be "prohibited imports" at the Customs barrier, the contents of on-line services sourced from overseas cannot be vetted in any practical sense. Australian providers of access to such services were concerned, however, that they should not be held liable for the content of the material they are transmitting when they have no responsibility for its authorship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The network operators and service providers in the 0055 audiotex industry had put similar arguments to the Committee in 1991 and 1992. On that occasion the Committee had acknowledged the legitimacy of their argument in principle, but had seen as an important part of their role the imposition of appropriate content standards on their "authors" through their contractual arrangements. These provisions would then be subject to enforcement action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has made similar recommendations in relation to on-line services. It has called for the establishment of an industry-based body to adjudicate on claims of breach of content standards and, through the contractual arrangements between network operators, access providers, service providers and clients, impose realistic sanctions. The Committee has also called upon the Australian Government to pursue at appropriate international forums the concept of classification at source of all material placed on-line, based on an agreed set of classification standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that, in its recommendations, it has given the industry a sound regulatory environment in which its most positive features can flourish while appropriate attention is paid to the areas of greatest concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recognises that the march of technology is placing in doubt traditional approaches to content regulation. With the likelihood of continuing globalisation of information and entertainment services in the future, through such technologies as satellite and broadband, the consumer of the future may have to take much greater responsibility for their choices. It is then the Government's responsibility to ensure that the consumer is suitably empowered to make informed decisions. To this end the Committee proposes to sponsor a conference of experts to examine how a program of widespread public education and debate might be fostered.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the committee this was one of the most difficult inquiries of the year&mdash;we have had 25 this year&mdash;made even more difficult by the amount of interest it generated in the ACT by various groups and people. What also made it more difficult was the amount of lobbying that all members of the committee were subjected to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original proposal was for three office blocks to be located within the Barton area of the ACT. The committee has rejected two of these proposals for a number of reasons&mdash;the appropriateness of office buildings in this area and difficulties concerning the Canberra plan. One strong argument put to the committee was that moving a large number of public servants from Civic would result in Civic being devastated. The majority of the committee does not accept this view, especially considering that 10 years ago the fear was that Civic would be overpopulated and the government decided that once public servants moved out their place would not be taken by other public servants. This is now regarded as the `conventional wisdom' in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a question from the committee to the National Capital Planning Authority, we were advised by them that backfilling of vacated offices is permitted. The committee emphasises that there is no ban on public servants backfilling vacated offices. However, the committee is concerned at the combined impact of these three projects on Civic, while not sharing the rather alarmist views expressed by some witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal of the Department of Industrial Relations on what is known as the Woolshed site has been rejected by the committee. The committee believes better use could be made of this land and the proposed car park structure would be inappropriate and not in keeping with the national significance of the Barton area. The committee is of the view that the proposal should not proceed on the Woolshed site and that Australian Estate Management should seek another site, preferably in Civic, to house the Department of Industrial Relations. A Civic location would partially meet the objections to the loss of personnel from Civic outlined by many groups, including the ACT government. The committee expects to be fully briefed on the new proposal for the Department of Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers that the AFP has put up the most persuasive case for a Barton location. A majority of the committee believes the AFP proposal should proceed as planned on the Hinkler site. However, in coming to this conclusion, the committee regards it as regrettable that it will be necessary&mdash;this is something that disturbed me&mdash;to demolish the George Knowles building, which was refurbished only three years ago at a cost of some $2 million. That is one of the reasons why we have a minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third proposal concerns a new office building for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. The committee does not see the need for this building to be in Barton and recommends that this building be placed in either Tuggeranong or Gungahlin, with an emphasis on Tuggeranong. </PARA>

The committee was surprised at the evident lack of coordination between the National Capital Planning Authority and the ACT Planning Authority which was displayed in these projects. That is the reason why in the final report there is a brief dissenting report by myself, Neil Andrew MP, Ray Braithwaite MP and Bob Halverson OBE, MP, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These proposals should be deferred for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the undue haste that these proposals were presented to the Committee by AEM</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the fact that two of these proposals will require referral back to the Public Works Committee of the 38th Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>We were placed under a considerable amount of pressure. I do not remember the committee having three important buildings included in one project before. If they had come as individual projects and we had had time, I think perhaps we may have been able to give it better consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my major concerns&mdash;and it is shared by a lot of others&mdash;is the effect that three large buildings like these and the number of people in them will have on traffic flows in the Barton area, given the fact that in recent times we built the new DFAT building. I do not know how many people it will house. At a cost of over $180 million, it must house a large number. The Motor Traders building is also in the area. It must be evident to all of us who travel to the house on the hill that there is a fair amount of development going on in the Barton area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had evidence from the ACT government that they did not know whether they could provide the infrastructure there. There are two planning authorities in Canberra. I could never see the sense of that. We had a lot of evidence that there did not seem to be a plan for the whole precinct. One of the recommendations in the report is that a decent plan be organised for Canberra so that when similar matters come up in future we will know the effect that the movement of 1,400 public servants from one area such as Civic to another area such as Barton will have on that area. That was a major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Reid wishes to speak on this matter, so I will not continue for much longer. We are concerned about this matter. I do not know why there was this undue haste. The committee was quite happy to look at it again next year. The committee staff worked through the night so that this report could be presented to the parliament today. I do not know why there was this haste. Nevertheless, that is where we are at. I have presented this report to the Senate. I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am responding to the report tabled this afternoon by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works relating to the proposed York Park North office construction in Barton, the redevelopment of the Hinkler site in Barton and the redevelopment of the woolshed site in Barton. As Senator Calvert indicated, the report was supported by a majority of the committee. There is also a minority report to which he has referred and which I urge the Senate to adopt. Therefore, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)rejects the committee's recommendation that the proposed redevelopment of the Hinkler Building site, Barton, ACT, should proceed; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) rejects any proposal for construction of public works at Barton for eventual use by hundreds of public servants transferring from existing offices in Civic, until the Joint Federal/ACT Metropolitan Canberra Growth Strategy Review has completed its inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Calvert's final point, which was not the point I had intended to start with, was that the committee had no information before them of the impact on traffic movement in the area, with the bringing in of this enormous number of public servants, in addition to the ones coming in to the York Park development, which is nearly completed and will be occupied quite soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall go through the report and make several comments on it. It is an absolute mystery to me how this report could be before the parliament this afternoon when it quite clearly has been done in an enormous rush. I attended for part of both days of the hearings. One member of the committee commented that there were more people there than he had ever seen at a Public Works Committee meeting. Senator Calvert endorsed that. Many submissions were presented. Many matters which were raised before the committee have not been answered by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: who is pushing this project? Presumably it is one or other of the ministers in the House of Representatives. Mr Walker is the minister in charge of Estate Management. Mr Kerr is the minister in charge of the Federal Police. I do not know whether they have been lobbying the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From every indication over the last couple of weeks there was an expectation that more work needed to be done and more consideration needed to be given to this matter. Whiz bang, here it is this afternoon, to go ahead immediately! Is it the pea and thimble trick? `There are three buildings; we will see which one gets approved.' It is a bit hard to say whether that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the report in more detail, in paragraph 20 it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lease for the headquarters building is due to expire in August 1998.</PARA>
<PARA>My understanding is that it was due to expire in 1997 but that a year's extension had been granted. But that is not the end of the lease. There are two further periods of five years each&mdash;that is, 10 years&mdash;which could be added to it. It is only five years since it was fitted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this building, which is presently occupied by the AFP, is that it is in Northbourne Avenue. It is a prime site in Civic. Once vacated, it is very likely that it will stay empty for a considerable period. That would be a matter of concern for the landlords. The important point is the impact on Civic of having that building, which is next to a small garden and which is in a central part of Civic and an important part of Northbourne Avenue, vacant when there is no need for it to be vacant and when there has been no consideration of the total impact on Civic. In addition, there are spaces which are already empty and other movements out of Civic which are to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 9 of the report the committee refers to the issues that came before it: the need for the works, the cost of the works, wider planning issues, impact on infrastructure at Barton, impact on Civic and other issues. I do not believe the committee has adequately considered all these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report states that some ACT federal members of parliament expressed concern. Let me say that three out of four ACT federal members of parliament expressed concern about these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognised the concerns expressed during its inquiry regarding planning policies in the ACT. They seemed to ignore that by going ahead as they have in this piecemeal fashion. The committee noted that the Commonwealth and ACT governments have announced a joint review of urban planning. Let us wait at least for that report. Mr Howe, in conjunction with the Chief Minister of the ACT, instigated that review. We should not be rushing ahead with these things. They have announced that this committee is to review planning. I believe we ought to have the benefit of that information before we proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At paragraph 40 the committee says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this is an issue which for the longer term should be considered by the joint review referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA>They referred to the fact that these three projects take four per cent of the work force out of Civic. The report also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It became clear to the Committee that there is a general misconception that there is a ban on replacing Commonwealth staff moving from Civic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was assured by the NCPA that no such ban exists.</PARA>
<PARA>That might have assured the committee, but it is not the popular perception which has been in existence for the last four years, since 1991 at least. That needs to be laid to rest and dealt with. It is the perception. The report also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Committee is concerned at the combined impact of these three projects on Civic</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">while not sharing the rather alarmists views expressed by some witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA>Why was there this rush to go ahead with it? The report also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also shares the concern expressed by the Master Builders Association (MBA) that the delivery method proposed by AEM will disadvantage the ACT construction industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The woolshed proposal, which is not going ahead, should have gone to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories before it went to the Public Works Committee. But that did not happen either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report which Senator Calvert presented to the Senate refers to the undue haste with which the proposals were presented to the committee by AEM and other matters that ought to be taken note of by the parliament in saying, `Enough is enough. This does not go ahead at the present time.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key office users of space in Civic are the Commonwealth government, with 310,000 square metres; the ACT government, with 50,000 square metres; the private sector, with 90,000 square metres; a total of 450,000 square metres. As a result of these proposals, with AusAid and Defence moving out, 55,900 square metres of office space will be vacated, in addition to that which is already vacant in Civic. Another large building is under construction in Civic at present. There are no tenants for it. It will be a wasteland. This parliament is being asked to collude in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Civic is an important part of the parliamentary triangle and needs to be a significant part of the ACT. It needs to be in good order and it needs to be well housed with public servants. The impact if it is not is the degradation of the area. There will be a dramatic impact on Civic retailers and service providers. Car parks will be sitting there underutilised, plus the cost of putting car parking and other infrastructure into Barton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some will say that these are magic jobs in the construction industry. They will be in the construction industry, and that is important. If you look at the evidence given to the committee you will see that the construction industry was not saying, `Jobs, jobs, jobs. This must go ahead, no matter the cost to the rest of the community.' Everybody recognises that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already tenants in Civic have lowered rents to keep tenants there and there is a risk of institutional investment, not only in Civic but also in the ACT, being affected by this rash action. All I suggest is that the parliament defers going ahead with the project that is being recommended and the others as well until such time as the committee which Mr Howe has set up in conjunction with the ACT government has reported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe recognises that there is a significant impact on Civic from the action that his colleague ministers are seeking to take at the present time. He is seeking to do something about Civic and the general planning of Canberra, Gungahlin, Tuggeranong, Belconnen and even Woden as a consequence of what has occurred. I ask for the Senate's support for my amendment to the motion, that this project should be put on hold. </PARA>

It has got some continuation in the construction sector because of its recommendation about the Hinkler building redevelopment. It has some concern about the continuing strength of Civic by its recommendation about the DIR proposal.

There is no doubt that the workers in the building industry, whose representatives I have discussed this with, regard this as a very important part of the continuing generation of jobs for building workers in this town and for those who supply to it and for all the ancillary economic activities that flow from construction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee recommendations already defer two of the three proposals. In an employment term, that is not ideal, but we do have to balance all the competing elements. The amendment makes no attempt to do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I am not sure that what the committee recommends is what I would have done if I were on the committee, but it is a balanced proposal. It seeks to deal with the differing imperatives that it has on it and it is the only balanced proposal before us and it should be endorsed. It is a recommendation to the Senate. The Senate has the power to amend it in any way it chooses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from Senator Calvert, who is on the Public Works Committee, that that was the recommendation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid and Mr Acting Deputy President, we will not know what a disaster the York Park project is until people start moving into it. From the information I am getting back from little birdies that come to whisper to me about what is happening there, it is clear that the message I gave to Mr Wilenski and the people within DFAT who were pushing the York Park project back in 1992 is that it would be yet another unmitigated disaster of this Commonwealth government when it comes to building buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked at the Casselden Place project in some detail; indeed, we had an Auditor-General's report into the Casselden Place building in Melbourne where this government proceeded to build over $200 million worth of building. The Auditor-General's report that was subsequently done after I raised the matters in this chamber time and again showed that this Commonwealth government had lost over $100 million on that one building in Melbourne. That was an enormous waste of taxpayers' money. As a consequence of that Casselden Place inquiry, Senator Spindler successfully moved a motion that there be an Auditor-General's inquiry into the Australian Estate Management Group, a business of DAS. I understand that that Auditor-General's inquiry has virtually concluded and is currently with AEM for comment. It will be tabled in this place early in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from my own investigations through estimates committees, and also through my experience on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration when we did an inquiry entitled `Property management in the Australian Public Service', that AEM has a number of disasters on their hands. They have not performed well and the Commonwealth's management of its real estate assets is an international and national disgrace and disaster that is potentially costing the Australian people hundreds of millions of dollars. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being wasted by this organisation and the Commonwealth and the cabinet's poor decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, the members of the Public Works Committee who try to keep a bit of a reign on this government's ad hoc decisions to build buildings around the place are up against AEM. They do a very good job, but they are up against it. When we get to the stage where this report is tabled in the Senate and Senator Reid, who understands the Canberra aspects of these decisions and the social and economic impacts of that because of her position representing the ACT in this place, you have to wonder what is the motivation of the cabinet and the Labor government about building a new building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister that you do not create balance in these decisions by putting up a proposal to build three buildings and then say, `Lets have some balance and compromise and only build one.'

It is true that the committee does not run along a path that suggests that they accept every view the minister might have on developing buildings for accommodation for various government departments. We have over time been fairly clear in our views and suggested alternatives to those which the minister may have had at any given time. On this particular occasion we were not really happy with a couple of the projects. Indeed, the report suggests that they be given further consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I welcome this report of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney and its findings, with one notable exception which I will come to shortly. As the Senate will be aware, the committee was established following the opening of the third runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport and as a result in large part of an outraged community who feel their lives have been destroyed by altered air operations at KSA. I add for the record that it was only as a result of the combined efforts of the coalition and the Democrats in this chamber that the committee was ever established. I feel certain now that we were justified in our decision to have these matters referred to this parliamentary inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was apparent from the outset of the committee's establishment that there would be a massive response to this inquiry. The community response in terms of submissions received was nothing short of remarkable, with the committee having received well over 5,000 submissions&mdash;an overwhelming number by any standard. One of the most interesting aspects of the inquiry was that for many noise affected Sydney residents it was the first opportunity they had had to tell their side of the story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having inundated the Federal Airports Corporation's noise complaints line, many Sydney residents were at the end of their tether when the committee announced this inquiry. They felt that until now no one had been listening to them or took any notice of what they had to say about how aircraft noise was destroying their lives. For many of them, this committee represented a release valve, an avenue through which they could finally be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably a sad reflection on our democracy that people have to resort to parliamentary committee inquiries in order to be heard, but what it certainly proves is the absolute failure of the environmental impact assessment process to adequately predict the impact which the new runway would have on residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of airport privatisation, it is a matter of some considerable regret to me that despite the overwhelming evidence presented to the committee against privatisation, a recommendation has been produced in favour of it. Under the circumstances I have dissented from this finding. I believe there is practically no international precedent for the private leasing of a nation's airports. Virtually all the major airports in comparable countries to Australia are publicly owned and operated and no consideration is being given to the private leasing option. The Democrats do not believe that private leasing would be in Australia's economic, social or environmental interests. There is well-founded apprehension in the community that under a private regime commercial objectives will overrule the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst features of the EIS process was the appalling way in which people appear to have been deliberately deceived and misled as to what the impact on them would be. This must never be allowed to happen again. The EIS on the third runway at KSA appears to have been nothing short of a sales and marketing job, with the aviation authorities failing totally in their duty to the public to ensure a decent standard of objectivity in assessing noise impacts. Aside from the obvious bias, the EIS seriously failed in the key indicators, such as airport moderating modes and taking into account basic factors such as long-term wind analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of academics appearing before the committee confirmed the inadequate nature of the EIS. A matter of real concern was the fact that the EIS seems to have deliberately misrepresented and misused the available scientific literature. In light of these failures, the committee has made a series of recommendations in relation to the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek and the absolute necessity of conducting a proper and thorough EIS process in relation to that one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, quite a number of residents from western Sydney and local councils have expressed the concern that important environmental considerations were going to be overlooked in the same way as they were in relation to the third runway at KSA. It is essential that the government allay these concerns and ensure that the correct processes are adhered to in the development of Badgerys Creek if, indeed, that is to be the location of the second Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, I welcome and support the committee's recommendations, particularly those dealing with operational and remedial measures to be considered for implementation at KSA. Inevitably, much of the focus will be on the committee's recommendation that the new air space management plan be developed for KSA which examines the best way to use all three runways. It is my own view that the situation in which many residents of Sydney are now living is totally unacceptable in a civilised society. The people living under the concentrated flight path feel cheated and betrayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I am right when I say that no other senator on the committee lives under one of the flight paths. I do. I live under the east-west flight path. I believe the east-west runway should be reopened. In fact, it is my view that we should go back to where we were 18 months ago. It was safe then. We were only about six movements an hour under what we are now. We do not expect the new tower to open for some months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we should go back to where we were before the third runway was opened. We should go back to what was safe then and what was working then. There were only 55 movements an hour then. We should stop right there, work the airport at what it was working at for many months before then, and find another solution. That would mean opening the east-west runway again. That would mean that I would be living under it, yes. But it would also mean that those people who are living in hell, which is what they are doing, would not be living quite in hell any more. That is what I believe we should be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the community will take the opportunity over the next few weeks to have a look at all this and all the recommendations contained in the report, as well as all the evidence presented. In relation to the comments by Senator Forshaw which he attributed to the coalition about some coalition members wanting to hear evidence that the east-west runway should be fully utilised, yes, they did. Some government members were equally assiduous in searching for evidence that the government is doing the right thing and the current mode of operation should be maintained. Party political sensitivity was alive and well, and it was alive and well on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I must also say that, under the circumstances, I was very impressed with the way members of the committee worked together. Any disagreements we had were polite and reasonable. I thank all members of the committee for that. Senator Parer was an excellent chairman. He was fair and reasonable. He was open to innovation, and we had a lot of innovation. We held hearings in the areas affected. We held hearings in places that I have never been to before. It was very interesting and it was something that we should be doing in more committees. It was a pleasure to work with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would also like to record my sincere thanks to the secretariat of the committee. They worked very hard throughout this inquiry and they finally produced a thorough report in extremely tight deadlines. In particular, I would like to commend James Warmenhoven, the committee secretary. He is one of the most able and competent committee officers I have ever had the good fortune to work with over the years. Both James and Trish Carling, whom I have also known for a very long time, consistently displayed a remarkable level of patience under some very trying circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak to the report of the Senate Airport Noise in Sydney Select Committee. I have to say there was agreement on a number of things in the committee. There was agreement that the Kingsford Smith Airport is an essential part of the New South Wales infrastructure, that Kingsford Smith Airport is essential to the tourism industry and promotes employment in the region, and that the operations of the airport as a result of the noise and pollutants have made the quality of life for the residents around the airport less than it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major difference between the government and the opposition is that the government wants a solution and that really the opposition does not. The opposition sees the ill effects, the competing interests and the conflicts of different groups of residents as a political opportunity. The committee had a responsibility to find out what went wrong and to identify ways in which the process of planning and implementing major projects, such as the new runway, can be managed better in the future. This means both in the interests of good government and a safe and healthy community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report is marked not by objective assessment and analysis aimed at reaching a solution but by an attempt to ignite and exaggerate the difficulties and conflicts in the community. The opposition would have us believe that the difficulties arising from the conflicting interests between the airport operations and the surrounding communities only sprang up with the construction of the third runway and the reduced operations of the east-west runway. The truth is that the problem has existed since the construction of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the 1970s and 1980s the airport was experiencing congestion problems. The curfew shoulder periods were introduced to try to resolve this issue in 1988. This was to meet the overwhelming demand on the use of the airport by both international flights bringing tourists and country domestic movements. About 17 million passengers were passing through Kingsford Smith each year and the airport just couldn't cope. The log jams were getting so bad that delays and flight cancellations were costing approximately $40 million, according to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition during all their years in government did nothing about the adverse effects on residents surrounding the airport, nor did they try to resolve the congestion issue or to plan for their future. The Labor government's initiative to construct a new runway parallel to the existing north-south runway at Kingsford Smith and at the same time approving the development of the second major airport, Sydney West at Badgerys Creek, represented, in stark contrast, a fundamental approach to an extremely difficult issue. The two initiatives led to a significant increase in capacity and corresponding improvements in airport congestion. The improved capacity will go on to provide economic benefits for Sydney, New South Wales and Australia at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition advocated the new runway prior to its construction and clearly understood that a reduction in the use of the east-west was part of the new operations. Its change of policy position came about since the public response and it saw there was a political opportunity. John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, has been particularly hypocritical in his position. In evidence to the inquiry on 25 July 1995, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you are putting to me whether I knew that the contemplation in 1989 was that there would be the downgrading of the use of the east-west, the answer to that question is yes. I have never denied that.</PARA>
<PARA>John Howard was a most enthusiastic and active proponent of the third runway. He supported the third runway and was fully aware of the planned reduction in the use of the east-west runway. There is no record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of John Howard ever raising the issue of aircraft noise as a problem prior to the new runway being opened in November 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EIS document at the very outset also repeated the conditions regarding the downgrading of the east-west runway as outlined in the joint statement of 22 March 1998. Not only did the opposition not criticise the original proposal to downgrade the use of the east-west runway but they are on record as recognising that the construction of the third runway would lead to a reduction in the number of residents affected by aircraft noise. Charles Blunt, who was in 1989 the federal opposition spokesman for transport, gave a fairly lengthy statement in regard to that, which I will not repeat because of time constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming evidence to the committee from all expert agencies, such as the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia, is that restoring the east-west runway to full cross-runway operations would either reduce safety standards or the rate of aircraft movements, or create a substantial additional noise burden on surrounding residents. We just cannot take the risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the committee also gives recognition to the difficulties by backing away from their original draft recommendation where they bluntly call for the reopening and extended use of the east-west runway. In fact, they replaced it with, frankly, fairly much of a nothing recommendation that runs roughly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Minister for Transport direct the responsible authorities to develop a new airspace management plan for Kingsford Smith Airport and, in conjunction, revise the airport's noise abatement procedures. The new airspace management plan and noise abatement procedures should examine the best means of using all three runways at Kingsford Smith . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If anyone could recognise that convoluted recommendation as a recommendation to immediately reopen the east-west runway, then they must have a very broad imagination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, this committee report&mdash;and this is important&mdash;does not endorse the policy position of John Howard, nor does it endorse the policy position of the coalition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, rise to speak on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney. At the outset, I point out it is the most unusual committee I have been involved in&mdash;not because we were not civil to each other but because we did not go through the ordinary processes of discussing the report because of the highly political nature of the issue. I hope everybody realises&mdash;and I will use due care&mdash;that we have not gone through the processes that every other committee that I have ever been on has gone through. Let us face the politics of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was because we are in pre-election mode and in this case the opposition are desperate to, in a populous way, attract attention to their cause. I can understand that Senator Parer, as shadow minister for aviation, has had to switch and change as he has gone along and as the wind blows. In Mr Howard Senator Parer has a leader who defends Bennelong first, second and third and is doing everything possible to divert attention away from the real issues. The real issues are, as the minority report points out, there is a need to change the things that have been happening. That is summed up in the minority report, which puts forward:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current noise reduction strategies, providing for sound insulation and the management of flight paths, such as restricting flight paths to the north of the airport so as to minimise the number of homes affected, and prohibiting take-offs to the north on the third runway, should continue to be pursued in order to reduce possible adverse health effects.</PARA>
<PARA>That is recommendation 9 and appears in the health section of the minority report. When that is taken with the positive proposals that we have for the development of Badgerys Creek, we can see that is the solution for all those people in Sydney who everybody acknowledges have been stressed by the developments that have occurred because of the inadequate environmental impact statement that did not represent fully the problems that Sydney people would face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our recommendations in the minority report go on to mention that the mistakes that have been made at Sydney airport should not be repeated with the Sydney West airport. In this case we recommend that we immediately pass the legislation that the opposition have not passed to cause delays in getting Badgerys Creek up and running. That very delay this opposition has caused means that people under the flight paths of Sydney airport will suffer longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also propose in relation to the Sydney West airport that we ask the state Labor government in New South Wales to repair the damage that the Liberal coalition government in New South Wales caused at a state level by allowing estates to be built in the flight path area in the west of Sydney. Over the last few years the Fahey and Greiner governments have allowed estates to be built under where those flight paths will be, and people in the west of Sydney might be affected by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we have proposed that there be an improvement in the environmental impact system to make sure that we have the use of a public interest section and a regime applied to environmental impact statements so that the public interest can countervail the weaknesses that occurred at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of an agreement with my whip that I will not speak at great length, I have time to refer to only the coalition's proposals. My colleagues have shown the hypocrisy of the opposition's proposals, but I just want to draw attention to why we say that we should prohibit the take-off of planes to the north from the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week the opposition was sprung in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by Tom Burton headed `Coalition risks new airport noise protest'. He pointed out the fact that under the coalition government proposal&mdash;if they were to be in government&mdash;planes would be taking off to the north on the existing third runway. Of course, that is the secret plan. Although Senator Parer, as the shadow minister, was quick to deny it, I point out to the people of Sydney, particularly those people who will be affected, that this is just another way the opposition would, if they were ever in government, vastly affect them in relation to activity that has been banned. </PARA>

Poor Senator Parer, as the shadow minister, has to keep picking up the pieces as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) changes his mind in his populous style of trying to attract votes and protect Bennelong first, second and third. </PARA>

In a meeting of that committee, Senator Forshaw, who came to every single meeting of that committee, took the viewpoint that, rather than go through the draft report item by item and page by page, and in view of the fact that he was going to write a minority report, it would be better if he took the draft report away and wrote his minority report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Childs, that is not correct. That was not the point. In fact, you have indicated, as has Senator Forshaw, that there are items of agreement, particularly with regard to noise forecasts and all these sorts of things. This was a request made to me by Senator Forshaw, and I was happy to accede to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another remark was made by Senator Neal. She indicated that she did not have the chairman's draft report by last Friday. In fact, the chairman's draft report was given to the Labor members of the committee last Thursday. We attempted to do it by Wednesday, but at that stage I personally had not had the opportunity to review it. The report was given last Thursday to all members of the committee who wanted it. So Senator Neal's remark that no Labor member of the committee had that report by last Friday is clearly incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Childs says that it was changed. Very minor details were changed. I gave Senator Forshaw my assurance&mdash;and this was in keeping with the relationship we had during the committee hearings, irrespective of the fact that we certainly had differing points of view&mdash;that if there were any significant changes to the report I would draw them to his attention. That was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought while I had the opportunity that I would quote an article relating to the issue of safety. Senator Forshaw has made it very clear in his response that no-one has ever claimed that the use of intersecting runways is unsafe. Let me say that that is not correct. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said it is unsafe. He used violent language to talk about the dangers of intersecting runways as did the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Senator Forshaw has clarified that by toning down the language used by the Prime Minister and the minister. It is worth quoting from a recent article in the newsletter of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators of Australia which deals with Sydney airport. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedural changes that have followed the introduction of a third runway&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the closure of the east-west&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport are concerning Guild members in Australia. Former Regional Committee Chairman and Chief Pilot of Qantas, Ken Davenport, points out the "third runway" is a misnomer because when the new runway was brought into service the old-cross-runway became subject to stringent limitations.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to explain to readers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the original operations were conducted on two runways, 07/25 and 16/34 i.e. an east-west and a north-south runway system. A simultaneous operating system, SIMOPS, enabled both runways to be used at the same time, greatly reducing delays even if it did, on occasion, cause hair raising experiences for both pilots and controllers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the second runway . . . was commissioned, the east-west runway was closed for political reasons&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and could be used only when the crosswinds on the other runways exceeded 25kt. A pilot could request the east-west runway for operational reasons but ran the possibility of a "please explain" to the Company, Civil Aviation Authority or the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I contend that undue pressure is being applied to pilots not to use the east-west runway when good airmanship would dictate this runway should be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All pilots of large, noisy jet aircraft are aware of the noise they generate and try at all times to minimise its effect on the community.</PARA>
<PARA>This came through in evidence given to us by pilots. They feel guilty because of a flight path situation which has been imposed upon them by this government and this minister and not their own requirements. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minimum drag approaches are flown with minimum, or even no, reverse thrust on landing. Departures using downwind components and optimal climb procedures are also used. The pilots seem to be playing their part but where does it all end?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pilots may reasonably feel that being forced into a take off with maximum crosswind component is questionable. We have all heard of windshear.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of a myriad of statements similar to those made to the committee. Those statements are made by people who should know. The people who have not been listened to are international pilots and domestic pilots. One domestic pilot even apologised to the people because of the noise he was causing. It is not his fault, but he said he had no option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee addressed all the issues. I believe the majority report is certainly a hard hitting report and addresses the issues front on. The recommendations in relation to noise and pollution give a balance. We are suggesting that the noise problem will not go away and with the passage of time will get worse unless it is addressed. Under the current configuration it is bound to get worse. No matter what the government or the minister like to think the problem will not go away. Those people have been subject to a barrage which they described to us as being like in a war zone without bombs. </PARA>

The bills before the Senate are the government's request for further appropriations&mdash;further moneys, to put it simply. What it really does spell out more than anything else is the collapse of the government's budget strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in these appropriations a request for some $1 billion extra due to the government's unlisted expenditure, which now confirms that the government's budget will go into deficit this year, and that is regardless of the government at the last budget declaring that they would have this budget in surplus this financial year. Of course, that is just not going to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, they were gilding the lily when they declared in the last budget statement that they would have a budget in surplus, primarily due to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. They had estimated a budget surplus of some $718 billion. The likelihood now is that it will be a $718 billion deficit. That is a complete turnaround&mdash;a greater than a $1 billion turnaround. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had another collapse of a government strategy. In fact the budget surplus was the only strategy left to the government. Today we have had the government in this house, and indeed the other house, declare that we are entering the final days of the parliament before the election. That was obvious today when Senator McMullan pretty well announced that this was his final question time, as well as Senator Gareth Evans. The same theme ran through the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it little wonder that the government now really does want to close the parliament down before the real economic results come in next year. No matter how much gloss they put on the national accounts figures yesterday, they know as well as every other commentator in the national media who has reported on this that underlying those national accounts is a set of very bad figures. I do not think it was put any better than in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> editorial. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The harsh reality is that once the one-off bounce back in rural output and the unsustainable lift in stock levels are removed, the result is a domestic economy as flat as the proverbial pancake.</PARA>
<PARA>The government well knows that the next set of national account figures, the December quarter&mdash;which will be out on 30 March next year, around about the time of the election date&mdash;will of course most likely show a further slowing in the economy, if not a negative growth in the economy. This of course reflects poorly on the government's employment strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know now that unemployment is on the rise. It has shot up from its best level of eight per cent and is now at 8.5 per cent. That best level of eight per cent is no better than the level at the beginning of the so-called recovery. The unemployment figures have not improved at all. In fact the youth unemployment figures are trending up at some 29 per cent. This really puts the economy in a mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certain economic indicators that the government cannot run away from, that they cannot gild the lily on and that are really starting to bite now in the community in every household and every family. One of the most potent indicators of the standard of living is the GNP per capita. In comparison, Australia in 1983, according to World Bank data, ranked ninth in the world in terms of gross national product per capita. This gross national product per capita is recognised universally as a nation's standard of living. According to the most recent data released in 1993, Australia has slid to 21st in the world. So we are down 12 places in the term of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit, which we all know now is some six per cent of GDP, is the worst in the world. We used to come into this parliament and say that we were second only to Mexico; that our current account was fast approaching the disastrous state of the Mexican economy. Ironically, it prompted the Mexican ambassador to complain to the parliament for deriding his country. He was quite right. It was not long before Australia's current account as a percentage of GDP became worse than the Mexican statistic. That is a very embarrassing state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it now places Australia as having the worst current account deficit in the OECD countries. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> quite laughingly mocks Australia and says, `Guess who's looking like Mexico?' Who would have thought that Australia would ever be compared with the Third World country of Mexico in such mocking terms by such a leading economic magazine as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. That is read by the international community and that is now how Australia is seen in the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures get worse. With a deteriorating current account you get an increasing foreign debt. Australia has a record foreign debt of $180 billion, which again ranks as one of the world's worst. As far as our interest rates go Australia ranks, in regard to its prime rates, as the equal highest amongst the developed countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to unemployment, because all these statistics cascade down to what is the most basic effect upon the households and families of Australia. You may well talk about foreign debt, current accounts and GNP per capita, which often seem like lofty economic terms&mdash;indeed, they are lofty economic terms to the ordinary Australian family and household&mdash;but they cascade to an effect that Australians all know about: the unemployment rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very few people in Australia who have not been affected by the unemployment rate in this country. We have an increasing unemployment rate. There are some 800,000 Australians unemployed, and 29 per cent is the unemployment rate of teenagers. That has not only an economic effect but also a great social effect upon those teenagers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is incumbent upon the government to take note of these economic statistics and the economic critics such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, the Business Council of Australia and the government's very own economic advisory body, the Bureau of Industry Economics. The bureau declares that the government have been too slow in progressing its micro-economic reform policies; that it has reached a stage of micro-economic fatigue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is borne out in the most stark way in a paper published by the bureau of economics in August 1995 called `International benchmarking: Waterfront'. If you cannot get your waterfront right you are never going to get your exports right. If you cannot get them off the wharves in the most efficient and competitive manner, or get them off at all, then you are never going to be able to compete internationally. Your business is handicapped from the start and it is just another additive cost upon business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report has some very telling statistics which really do reflect upon all other failures of the government in micro-economic reform. For example, the waterfront charges for containers in Australia are considerably higher than most of those surveyed in ports in New Zealand, Asia and Europe. The greatest concern with Australia's performance must lie with stevedoring productivity, where crane rates&mdash;that is, container moves per hour per crane&mdash;declined during 1994 and fell back to 1991-92 levels, recession levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Crane rates at the very best performing Australian container terminals were 18.5 moves per hour at Fremantle. That is equivalent to some of the poorest performers in Europe. So our best performance is seen to be equivalent to Europe's worst. The BIA survey of ship operators indicates that timeliness and reliability are more important than price. Moreover, the survey indicated that timeliness and reliability for the waterfront services in the Australian ports lagged well behind the overseas ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we still have the same old problems on our waterfront&mdash;which you can relate back to the Maritime Workers Union. That union has had more strikes on the waterfront than any other union in this country. In the past 18 months they have had some half a dozen or more very costly strikes in this country&mdash;some of them pathetic and useless; most of them utterly unwarranted, as we saw only some weeks ago when they all went out in sympathy for their CRA comrades. That cost the country some $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It being 7 o'clock I will conclude my remarks, but I think it is worthy to say that the government's economic statistics and indicators have not improved.

I want to revisit the matter that I have spoken about each year for about the last five years, and that is the level of funding provided to the Department of the Senate, the arrangements which have been entered into, the resolution which was passed some years ago when former Senator Richardson was the chairman of the appropriate estimates committee and the lack of resolve to do anything about it, except to say that successive finance ministers seem to utterly ignore the resolution and the appropriations and staffing committee of the Senate and, on this occasion, ignore the recommendations and proposals adopted for funding which arise from a review of the committee's resources conducted jointly by the Department of the Senate and the Department of Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A view has been put to the committee by the Clerk of the Senate, and has been accepted by the committee and in fact confirmed, as I recall, by the President that, with the present level of funding, there can be no guarantees and no certainty that the committee system will be able to function in an adequate and appropriate way. It seems that in this coming period, for the first time at least in my 13 or 15 years, or however long I have been here, the committees' work and the references they take will be subject to the level of funding. In other words, for the first time the committees will not be able to automatically accept references given to them by the parliament, given to them by the Senate, without considering whether or not they can be funded. The funding will dictate the level of activity and the contribution that the committee system makes in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said for some time that there is something obscene about the fact that the capacity of a parliament to function depends upon the funding provided to it by the executive government. While one expects parliamentary departments to have some recognition of uniform and universal funding constrictions and restrictions, in my view it is utterly wrong that the capacity of the parliament&mdash;the capacity of the chambers and the committees&mdash;to monitor, examine, consider or contemplate the activities or the conduct of the executive government is controlled by the executive government through the purse strings. I well remember some years ago Senator Walsh threatening with respect to a certain committee that he would ensure the committee did not fulfil the wishes of the parliament because it assured the Minister for Finance that the funding would not be made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an excellent argument to be had that appropriations for parliamentary departments should be creatures of the parliament and not creatures of the executive government. As it presently is, we are going back to Charles I, who restricted the funding to the parliament and said he would have a capacity to close the parliament down because he would not give it any funding. He lost his head. We are in a situation now where, if it is the view, the wish or the commitment of the Senate to examine the functioning, activities and expenditure of the executive government, it can be prevented from doing so by the executive government. In other words, there is no separation in terms of autonomy between the two. I have always thought that separation of powers was an essential ingredient in the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion the President of the Senate (Senator Beahan), following in the well trodden footsteps of his predecessors, wrote to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) expressing his concern that the considerations and contemplations of the appropriations and staffing committee of the Senate had again been ignored, except to say that on this occasion a joint committee of review was ignored. The President said in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee expressed its concern and disappointment at your failure so far to adopt fully the recommendations and funding proposals arising from the review of committee resources conducted jointly by the Department of the Senate and the Department of Finance, which recommendations and proposals were adopted by the committee on 21 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter observed that the Department of the Senate made several concessions in the course of the joint review in the interests of reaching an agreed outcome with the Department of Finance. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations and funding proposals in the report thus represent a compromise on what the department considered was warranted. It was expected that, the review having been thoroughly conducted and its report accepted by the Finance officers, there would be no difficulty in adopting it. I urge your consideration of its remaining recommendations and funding proposals when the matter next comes up during consideration of the 1996-97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say with the greatest of respect that is a vain hope. Nothing has changed. There is no indication that things will change. As I recall, the joint committee review was as a result of a meeting by I think the President and the Minister for Finance, and it was intended that it be a mechanism to ensure proper consultation between the Department of Finance and the Department of the Senate in good and healthy time prior to the construction of the budget. In past years funding figures have been set and put in place before the department or the appropriations and staffing committee have been given an opportunity to make a contribution. So we have advanced at least to having the facade of a committee to examine the funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 23rd report of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing observes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has now received a letter from the Minister for Finance confirming that the government is prepared to offer funding of $1 081 000, $500 000 for standing committees and $581 000 to continue permanent funding for secretariats for two select committees, without adjustment for the 1 per cent absorption determined in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear from the President's correspondence and from the committee's report that, not withstanding next year being an election year, there will be inadequate funding to allow the various committees to fulfil their obligations and responsibilities. For the first time in living memory committees could find themselves in the position where they will be given a term of reference by the Senate and will not be able to fulfil their obligations because of funding constraints. In other words, the obligations and responsibilities of the committees will be suspended because of a lack of financial resources. I find that grossly obscene, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rhetorical question I put to the Senate is this: what does the government propose to do about it in future? If the present process continues the committee system will be utterly neutered. The committee system will be restricted to a level of inquiry and investigation that the executive government judges appropriate. Whenever an external body controls, directly or indirectly, the monitoring of the activities and conduct of another body, you can guarantee that there will not be proper and free ventilation of facts and circumstances which flow from the conduct of the monitored body. In this case, it means that the government will no longer be accountable to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to make the obvious point that committees are no more and no less than creatures of the Senate. They are a reflection of the Senate. When their reports are adopted they articulate the views, the commitments, the determinations and the resolutions of the Senate. If they are unable to function it means that the Senate as a whole&mdash;this chamber, set up to review and to contemplate; a second deliberation of legislation and activities of government&mdash;will no longer be able to fulfil its obligations. Once we arrive at that position the Senate, in many respects, save for rubber stamping legislation or rejecting it, will not have the capacity to make proper determinations and will fall to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Senate addresses this question of how it will ensure that the committees have appropriate funding and that they are divorced and removed in some way from the outcomes of the government. At present we go, year in and year out, with the committee, through the President, writing to the Minister for Finance, expressing their disapproval and dissatisfaction at not only the funding but the process of determining that funding. Nothing changes; it stays the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, the time seems to have come where the Senate, through a committee of its own, ought to review the process of funding&mdash;not the level of funding, not the need for funding, not the need for resources. The committee ought to examine the process used and the methods used to determine funding for the parliament itself. Until such time as there is autonomy, whatever the constraints, on the part of the Senate in its deliberations and determinations of the level of funding, the Senate will not be able to function in the way intended by our forefathers and by those contemporaries serving within it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I go to what I intended to talk about, let me say something that I do not say very often. I agree very substantially with what Senator Crichton-Browne said about Senate committees and Senate committee funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter I want to speak about is one of the appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). It is the $7 million for the upgrading of the New South Wales showground facilities in order that they be handed over to Mr Rupert Murdoch. That $7 million could do an awful lot of things, including funding the committee system and improving hospitals, roads and schools. It is almost beyond comprehension that the government wants, effectively, to give that money to an ex-Australian&mdash;not even a current Australian&mdash;billionaire to help him construct a profitable theme park, profitable for himself, on what should be and still will remain, although it is leased, public land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats wrote to the government, asking 15 very specific questions on why and how the money for the showground site would be spent. The reply we received gave none of the detailed explanation that we sought. We asked the same very specific questions in the estimates committee hearings. Neither the minister nor the department head was able to provide satisfactory and detailed responses to those questions. We have asked additional questions at the estimates committee about the expenditure, but the committee staff, with the best will in the world&mdash;and they do have that&mdash;will not be able to furnish answers before mid-December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are left with a government request to approve the expenditure of a large amount of taxpayers' money, without adequate justification for doing so. There are other good reasons why the money should not be appropriated, at least until our concerns and the public's concerns are fully answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The details of the proposed studio raise serious concerns about the impact of the showground site complex on the showground site and the surrounding area. Over 1,000 cars will be introduced into an area which is already one of the most congested in Sydney. The studio complex will take over most of what is now public land in one of Sydney's most densely populated areas&mdash;one of the most densely populated areas in Australia. The complex will attract hundreds of people to the site on a regular basis, creating as yet untested impacts on the local environment. The showground also contains important heritage structures. We still do not know their fate. Until the government has fully assessed all the impacts on the area we cannot, in conscience, support this appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also concerns with the processes followed. The whole tender process for the showground site is now being investigated by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. Further, a legal challenge against the New South Wales government also questions whether the allocation of the showground site was tainted by a conflict of interest by one of the Royal Agricultural Society's directors, as well as the legal right of the RAS to sign a lease with Fox studios. The case also questions the legality of the New South Wales government's decision to use the state environmental planning policy process to rezone the showground site so it can be used as a studio complex. It would be totally wrong to appropriate that money until the concerns raised both by the ICAC inquiry and the legal action are resolved and the allocation processes are found to have been appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also now real doubts as to the benefits of the Fox studio complex. Premier Carr's promise of up to 6,000 jobs for the state is also looking a bit shaky, in light of the statement by the Fox studio's chief executive officer that the complex would create between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs and, of those, only between 550 and 700 will be in the film industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Gold Coast film complex is any guide, the studios at the Gold Coast complex have yet to generate a profit. The theme park in the complex is doing very nicely, thank you. Perhaps more tellingly, 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the studio users at the Gold Coast operation are from overseas. The promises of huge benefits the Fox studio complex will deliver for the Australian film and television industry must be seriously questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, this $7 million appropriation amounts to a government request for money, with no detailed list of expenditure, after processes which are being questioned, to undertake work which has neither been listed nor costed, with potentially severe impacts on the site and the surrounding area which have not been assessed. I am very disappointed that the government would make such a request. I am equally disappointed that the opposition intends to vote for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston was present at the estimates hearing and was as anxious as the Democrats to obtain detailed answers on why and how the $7 million would be spent. I can only ask why the opposition's concerns disappeared at some point between the estimates hearing and this debate, to the point where they support the appropriation but are asking the government not to hand over the money until ICAC has reported positively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell Senator Calvert, whose second reading amendment I am speaking to, that the government will hand over the money. It does not matter what we tell them, they will hand over the money. As soon as it is appropriated it is the government's to do with as they will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will not be voting for Senator Calvert's amendment. We agree with paragraphs (a) and (b), but we think the way to stop the government disbursing these moneys until such time as all of this is resolved is not to give it to them until that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather fortuitous that I am here to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 4) now because I will follow on from what Senator Bourne has said, which will lead me to the amendment I will move on behalf of the opposition. As Senator Bourne said, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) provides for a $7 million payment to the New South Wales government for infrastructure costs with the establishment of the Fox film studios at the Sydney showground site.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell Senator Bourne and other senators here that I know the Sydney showground site reasonably well. As a former president of the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania, I have spent a fair amount of time at the Sydney showgrounds&mdash;in some areas more than others. I do know the difficulties that were being experienced at the showground. Senator Bourne quite rightly pointed out the parking situation. Nevertheless, over the years the Royal Easter Show has been one of the biggest events, if not the biggest event, in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That facility has provided great entertainment for the people of New South Wales, particularly the country people, for many years. I know for a fact that many of the old show people&mdash;exhibitors, graziers and the like&mdash;are very sad to be leaving that particular area because it has been around for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say I am very pleased to see that the government is making $25 million available to help that happen. The alternative was to upgrade the old facilities which were, in some areas, becoming past the stage of being able to do anything with. I do not think anybody has any argument with the showgrounds moving out to Homebush. I do not think the Democrats have any problem with that. The coalition certainly has not. We support the appropriation of the $25 million towards the Royal Agricultural Society at Homebush Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that my very good friend Trevor Smidt, who is still the president of show society of New South Wales, Jim Davidson, who put so much of his life into that showground, and Colin Sanders, the director, would all welcome the fact that they are moving out. What they can do now is set up a show facility that will take the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales into the year 2000 with facilities that will be second to none in Australia. They can custom build everything they want, because at present there are certainly deficiencies in a lot of areas out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a feeling listening to Senator Bourne that she may have been briefed by Clover Moore on this particular matter. Because of some of the heritage buildings on the showgrounds and the facility it provides, it is a matter of local concern. Given all the changes that have been made because of the Olympic Games, I do not think there is any doubt that the eventual move out to Homebush Bay is generally supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of contention is the $7 million payment for infrastructure costs associated with the establishment of the Fox film studios. From the outset the coalition has welcomed the decision by Rupert Murdoch to develop a film studio in Australia. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, said on 9 November 1995, `The coalition welcomes the fact that Mr Murdoch has decided to make such a major investment in Australia, not least because of the potential opportunities it is likely to open up for the independent production sector.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we are moving this amendment is to draw attention to the fact that there is an inquiry. The New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption is investigating certain aspects of the New South Wales Carr government's dealings with Fox studio. It is concerned about certain matters in respect of the tender process. Senator Bourne has already raised that matter. That is the reason we are moving this amendment. We do not believe that the federal government should disburse $7 million of taxpayers' money until ICAC has publicly confirmed that all processes associated with the dealings between the New South Wales government and the Fox studios are legal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward with great anticipation to visiting the new Agricultural Society headquarters at Homebush Bay. I look forward to seeing some of the innovations that are planned. I had representatives from the Australian Showmen's Guild and the Royal Canberra Show Society in my office today talking about where the showmen's industry is going in the late 1990s to the year 2000. This opportunity to custom build an agricultural society complex where you can provide all the facilities that you normally have for a showground and to custom build entertainment areas happens very rarely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been briefed on the way the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales is going to promote the entertainment area of the showground, the sideshow area&mdash;the rides and all the rest of it. It is quite fascinating to know how this is going to be done. Areas will be designated by the types of rides, the quality of the rides, the quality of the eating houses&mdash;`joints' as they called&mdash;so the public will have the best entertainment facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These areas will be called precincts. So you will be able to walk into an `Adrena-land' where you can go on the Gravitron and all those rides that make you feel sick. Then you will be able to go into another area where you can go on milder rides and then you can go into other areas. It is going to set a trend for the rest of Australia in the next century. I will be looking with great interest at what happens at Homebush Bay. I think the money that is being spent by the federal government on promoting and helping that facility to move is very significant. We do have concerns, as the Democrats do, about the $7 million. That is why we are moving this amendment. I move:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Schedule 2, page 15, Division 807, Other Services, item 2, Dr C. Lawrence&mdash;legal costs in relation to the Marks Royal Commission, omit "556 463", substitute "259 095".</PARA>

<PARA>The amendments seek to reduce the payment to the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, for legal fees; first of all to $495,095 and then, after a deduction of $236,000, which is the expected payment from the Western Australian government, to the final amount of $259,095. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be necessary to make some comments on how the Democrats have arrived at this position. In the first instance, we are adopting a somewhat different view from the opposition on the issue of Dr Lawrence's legal expenses. We start from the premise that the Marks royal commission was an inappropriate use of executive power and that it devalued the status of a royal commission by using it solely for the purpose of discrediting a political opponent. I note that this position is also supported by the opinion provided by the Clerk of the Senate that it is inappropriate for an executive in this way to create a situation where parliamentary privilege is attacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask what wrongdoing was exposed by the commission, what laws were exposed, what corruption was brought to the surface, what misuse of public funds was established, what recommendations for future development of public policy arose out of the proceedings. These are the usual content of the report of a royal commission, but that was not why the Marks royal commission was established. In short, the $8 million spent by the Western Australian government on holding this commission was a waste of Western Australian taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only finding of the commission was that the evidence appeared to suggest that Carmen Lawrence lied. But from the very moment that former health minister Keith Wilson first suggested her recollection was wrong, that imputation was already public and it should have been left to the public to decide whether or not she lied. I must say the Australian Democrats have always taken the view that it would have saved a lot of difficulty, a lot of expense, a lot of toing-and-froing, including the time of this chamber, if Dr Lawrence had said, `Well, I've made a mistake, I'm sorry I did, but there it is.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since she did not, it is also open to us to suggest&mdash;and we have taken the view&mdash;that it might have been better if Dr Lawrence had resigned and if the political prestige and power of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had not been put behind Dr Lawrence to the extent of keeping her in office when all the evidence points to the position that she did lie to the state parliament of WA and carefully avoided placing herself in exactly the same position as far as the federal parliament was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to do that, we believe, has devalued the standards of parliamentary behaviour and ministerial probity. However that may finally be judged, it does not affect the Australian Democrats position on the funding of Dr Lawrence's legal expenses. We have taken the view, previously set out in detail, that cabinet was entitled to make the decision to fund her legal costs. We extend that judgment also to the challenges that Dr Lawrence undertook to the validity of the inquiry. We do that on the basis that any citizen who finds herself or himself before a tribunal or a court is perfectly entitled and has the legal right to challenge the constitutionality of the law and the jurisdiction of the court or tribunal before which the citizen finds herself or himself. To that extent, our position also differs from that of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, where we differ markedly from the government's position on this one is in the quantum of the legal fees charged in the first place and which are now being claimed by the government in these bills so that the expenses can be paid. We believe there is no evidence whatsoever that in its decision cabinet took any precautions to set limits to the expenditure, to in any way put a monitoring process in place, to in any way control strategic decisions which inevitably had a result as far as costs were concerned and were reflected in increased costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This somewhat slipshod and cavalier treatment of expenditure out of the public purse for Dr Carmen Lawrence leads us to the position that we believe the Australian taxpayer, the Australian public, should not be expected to pay legal costs at these levels. We believe any payment should be based on the Western Australian Supreme Court scale rates, reduced by a further 20 per cent, to arrive at the level of expenditure which would be funded by legal aid if any Australian citizen found herself or himself before a tribunal and was seeking public assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in passing that the fees that were charged, and I take as an example Mr Gyles QC, are at the very top of the range&mdash;$500 per hour, up to $5,000 per day. These are not the sorts of levels that would be available to citizens who were asking for public assistance through legal aid. The Democrats believe the minister should not be in any different position from that of an ordinary citizen in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis we have deducted $68,000 claimed for travel and accommodation expenses for the interstate legal team, on the assumption that there would have been plenty of legal talent to choose from in WA, which also happens to be the home state of Dr Lawrence. We have left in an amount that could be apportioned to the travel associated with the challenges because, of necessity, they required travel to Sydney. But, after doing that, we have then measured the expenses. We would have liked a little more detail, but on the basis of the figures supplied we have then applied, as I said, the Western Australian Supreme Court scale rates and, for counsel fees, solicitors' fees, agents' fees, have deducted a further 20 per cent to arrive at the legal aid levels. We have then deducted only 20 per cent from the disbursements to make a proportionate deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That arrives at a figure of $495,095, less the $236,000 to be paid by the Western Australian government. Thus we arrive at the figure of $259,095, which the Australian Democrats believe is a fair, just and reasonable figure. This is the figure that the amendments are putting forward as a substitute figure in the relevant places in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). I commend the amendments to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say at the outset that the coalition opposes this amendment and does so on the basis that it has itself an amendment to put forward in relation to the sum in question. I will just touch on what the coalition proposes. It proposes that the sum stay the same as mentioned in the bill, but that there be a definition in clause 3A of the bill so that it is made quite clear that this money is only to be used for any costs associated with Dr Lawrence's appearances before the Marks royal commission. The coalition has taken the stand that it will support the funding of Dr Lawrence's fees in that regard but only in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler has gone into the minutiae, so to speak, of the actual funding itself and dealt with the figures at hand. Although this decision was very much ad hoc, on the run and, I would submit, made without sufficient consideration or legal advice, it has been handed to the Senate as a fait accompli. It does deal with Dr Lawrence's representation before the Marks royal commission, which the WA government itself saw was important enough to have Dr Lawrence legally assisted in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation is very different to the challenges. The Commonwealth guidelines even allow for the funding of a minister who is acting as a defendant, but they make a distinction where the defendant is a plaintiff. There is a difference between defending an action and initiating an action. In this regard, that principle has application because Dr Lawrence was, as it were, the defendant or not the initiator of the royal commission. But she certainly was the instigator of the challenges in the Supreme Court and the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detail that Senator Spindler has gone into really puts us in the position of being somewhat like a taxing master; that is, we have the bills before us. If you go to the Supreme Court or most courts, you can have your bills taxed. In this case the Attorney-General's Department has given evidence in estimates that it has scrutinised these bills and that it has gone through the bills to make sure that they are fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not happy about the situation we are faced with, that we are having this handed to us as a fait accompli, but, nonetheless, bills have been incurred in the course of representation of a minister before a royal commission. At this stage it really is unsatisfactory to be going through bills with a fine-tooth comb. I have previously said that we should have this degree of scrutiny and this degree of thoroughness, but the responsibility for that lies squarely with the government. It is the government that has made this decision. It is the government that runs the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;not the Democrats and not the coalition. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Spindler" NAMEID="0X4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is our responsibility to ensure that these fees are paid only for the purposes that we have agreed to, and we have agreed that funding go to representation before the royal commission. That is why our amendment specifies that legal costs should be paid only in relation to the royal commission and not in relation to any actions taken in any court in relation to the Marks royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying that it is really too late to go through the bills individually at this stage. The responsibility for that lies with the government. The fact is that the solicitors concerned could well substantiate their bill to the amount in question. They could well want to come before the Senate and justify their costs. By cutting the amount, I am afraid that we are doing that without any recourse to the solicitors concerned or without allowing them any justification of their bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ordinary course of events, there should have been clearer guidelines in place&mdash;and there is a Senate committee looking at that, as Senator Spindler knows. I think the guidelines that the Commonwealth has in place are insufficient in that there is lack of clarity and lack of transparency as to how a minister's costs are met. But, nonetheless, we are faced with a situation where, on the second last day of sitting, we have this put before us. It has been the coalition's view that there really is no alternative but to meet the costs for the representation before the Marks royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to Senator Spindler's amendment No. 4101, which deals with an amendment to clause 3A, I think there is merit in his proposed subsection (1) where in principle Senator Spindler has set out that the payment should relate to the `legal costs of Dr Lawrence in relation to the Marks Royal Commission remaining after deduction from those costs of any amount paid or payable by the Western Australian government'. I think that is in principle a good amendment. It makes it quite clear that there is no chance of any double-dipping and that there is no chance of any overlapping of costs so that you have two governments paying for the same item of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to proposed subsections (2) and (3), I believe the coalition amendment standing in my name is to be preferred because it is expressed in a way that has a degree of efficacy about it. In particular, proposed subsection (3) of my amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this Act, any reference, however expressed, to legal costs of Dr C. Lawrence in relation to the Marks Royal Commission does not include legal costs (however constituted)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think that proviso really does makes it clearer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of Dr C. Lawrence for or in relation to proceedings in a court in relation to the Marks Royal Commission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>`Proceedings in a court' would relate to the two challenges in the Supreme Court and the one challenge in the High Court. Senator Spindler's proposed subsection (3) simply states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this Act, reference to legal costs `<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">in relation to the Marks Royal Commission</EMPHASIS>'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that is taken from that part of the bill which refers to the payment of Dr Lawrence's fees&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not include reference to legal costs of Dr C. Lawrence for or in relation to proceedings in a court in relation to the Marks Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very close, but I do not think that it is expressed quite as widely as the coalition amendment. I think the expression `however constituted' is to be preferred. That really doesn't allow anything to slip under the door, so to speak, or to slip through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There really could be a combination here. I am suggesting that, should Senator Spindler's amendment fail, we move on to the amendments to clause 3A standing both in Senator Spindler's name and in mine. I would suggest that my amendment be moved in parts, discretely, so that we debate and deal with 3A(1), then 3A(2) and then 3A(3) accordingly. That is a suggestion I would make to the chair in relation to the progress of this matter. But in relation to Senator Spindler's amendment currently before the chair, the coalition is not minded to support the amendment for the reasons I have mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am open to the suggestion that was made about our second amendment. I do think my first subsection is better, and I am prepared to accept the argument on the other one. I will be happy to go along with that procedure. I think it achieves the basic purpose of ensuring that there is no double dipping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find Senator Ellison's arguments, however, on my amendment somewhat strange. He is trying to have it both ways a bit. He is saying there is a responsibility on the part of the Senate to scrutinise expenditure before it is paid out of the public purse, but it is not our job to carefully look at what we are being asked to pay. Either we have that responsibility, we discharge it and we look carefully at the reasons that are being put forward and we look carefully at the rates or we do not. While I said we might like to have a little bit of further detail, in actual fact what we have here is adequate for the purpose to which we have put it, and that is that the bills have shown the actual rates charged&mdash;the rates per hour, the rates per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rates per hour and the rates per day are, as I said, at the very top of the range. That is not the sort of scale that can be expected to be paid for an ordinary Australian citizen. The question simply is whether the minister should be in a different position. I ask the coalition to very seriously reconsider the position that they appear to be adopting on that amendment because it is soundly based, logical, just and fair. It simply says that the rates that have been charged are far too high and do not correspond with what an ordinary Australian citizen would be able to obtain. We have two people here asking support from the public for legal costs. I think they should be treated equally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that I do not support Senator Spindler's amendment for obvious reasons: an amendment that has been circulated in my name rests on the principle that the payment has not been valid in any event. I will not speak to that until my amendment is dealt with. I want the minister to clarify the figures involved. I have done several sums and I keep getting different totals all the time. So my question to the minister is: how much was the total legal bill to which the cabinet committed themselves for Dr Lawrence's funding? What is the breakdown in terms of the defence cost, the challenge cost and the contribution of the Western Australian government? Has that Western Australian contribution been paid already? Has it been left out of the calculations on the basis that it will be paid, or is it somehow included in that amount? I am actually asking for four figures&mdash;the total cost of Dr Lawrence's legal funding with the subitems of the defence cost, the challenge to the commission cost and the contribution to the WA government&mdash;and information as to whether or not that has been provided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are embarking here, first of all, on a procedure which is unique and unusual. I think it is unique that we are modifying an appropriations bill in a specific case because of legal costs incurred and because of, dare I say it, political points of view about the actual rather than so much about the costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These legal costs are high. The amounts of these legal costs have been brandished around the media as being high in order to attract spectacular attention in the community on the basis that somehow this is a bad thing that Carmen Lawrence is doing in incurring these legal costs by saying, `Look at the amounts. Aren't they high?' The amount of the legal costs is not a comment on Dr Lawrence. Dr Lawrence was doing nothing more than wanting to defend her interests before a royal commission that set out to put her in the position of a defendant and to destabilise, undermine and discredit her as a public figure. That is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the costs of doing that are high, that is a reflection on the legal system and the level of legal costs&mdash;not on Dr Lawrence. Yet somehow or other Dr Lawrence seemingly is being held to be in disrepute for incurring such an amount. I think what this Senate ought to direct its attention to is where the wrong is in the first place. In the first place the wrong is with those who visited this royal commission on her. In that respect, I acknowledge what Senator Spindler has said about this royal commission. He has canvassed its merits, or its lack of merits, the processes that it undertook and its findings. He has expressed his perceptions of what proper conduct might be ethically and politically, and he has gone on to question the legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he, as the mover of this amendment, has told us is that the Australian Democrats effectively in large part support the government's position about this. The Democrats demur on some elements of Dr Lawrence's conduct in terms of whether or not she should have stepped down since she was under a challenge of some sort. They seem to assume that she had something to clear up and, if she had cleared that up at the beginning of this process, maybe the process would not have gone on. They are presumptions. They are not presumptions that the government has; they are presumptions that the Democrats have. But I note and do welcome the views of the Australian Democrats about the pernicious nature of this royal commission and the manner of its conduct and its treatment of Dr Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, given those sentiments expressed by the Australian Democrats, I think this amendment then sits quite oddly. This amendment goes on to argue that the amount is too high and that the amount should be at the level of legal aid. I submit that that is a superficial argument. It is not true in the eyes of even the Western Australian government&mdash;the government who mounted this royal commission against Dr Lawrence. They have not applied this test in the settling of their fees to the extent that they have reimbursed her. So it is not a test, if you like, that those who set out to get her political scalp applied when it came to assessing legal fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is at least a reason for that, and that is that ministers of the crown, in their accountability to the Australian community, bear, I believe, a far greater responsibility and a far deeper accountability than ordinary citizens do. They are entrusted with high office. They are reposed with major responsibilities. They are in the public spotlight. Their conduct is and is expected to be at an elevated level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they are being challenged it is reasonable that they ought to attract the best legal defence that they can have. That legal defence comes at commercial rates. We know of this legal defence and its costs that evidence has been given to a committee of this parliament that these legal costs are fair, represent the true costs incurred and are within the commercial rates that apply. That is the true measure of what the level of costs should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you apply that measure you come up with a stunningly large figure. Again I point out that Dr Lawrence is defending herself against a royal commission attacking her and that was set up for that purpose. She is entitled to a quality defence. That is a basic right. Given the higher responsibility she bears, it is important that she be properly defended. The amount of the costs is not her fault. It is the cost of justice in a case like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first point that the Australian Democrats raised about comparing this to legal aid, can I say that I do not think it is true in terms of the public responsibility and accountability that goes to a minister. Even the Western Australian government has not applied that level. I suggest that that might be a compelling argument to rethink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly than that, Senator Spindler has raised a second argument in this case which goes to the choice of counsel or at least the geographical location of counsel. He believes that Dr Lawrence should have found a lawyer in Perth to defend her in a proceeding being conducted in Perth. Let us look at that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Marks is a resident of Melbourne and was recruited by the Western Australian government to conduct this royal commission after a national survey to find someone to coopt to do that job. They looked nationally and obtained who they thought was the best person in Commissioner Marks. They got him not from Perth, but from Melbourne. Moreover, when they looked for counsel assisting the commission they recruited Vanstone QC&mdash;I forget her Christian name; I apologise for omitting her Christian name&mdash;and she is not a resident of Perth, she is a resident of Adelaide. They obviously looked nationally in order to find a fitting person to be counsel assisting and they chose a resident of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of these facts, what Senator Spindler is saying is that, notwithstanding that, Dr Lawrence should have found a lawyer from Perth. I am also a resident of Perth when I am not living in Canberra. Most lawyers in Perth at one time or another have been associated with royal commissions, in the first instance, mounted by Dr Lawrence into what is styled WA Inc. and subsequent events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is entirely appropriate that fresh blood be considered in order that someone could appear before this commission to defend Dr Lawrence's legitimate interests. You would not find fresh blood among the legal fraternity in Perth. With the greatest respect to them&mdash;and I admire several of the practitioners in that community&mdash;all of them have had their hands on this sort of case at some time or other. To the second argument that she should have picked up someone on the local scene, I think that in the circumstances, with the greatest respect Senator Spindler, that is not appropriate. That is another reason for inviting you to reconsider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ellison has moved an amendment. Understandably and quite reasonably&mdash;and I do not criticise it&mdash;when he was speaking to Senator Spindler's amendment he did so by promoting his own and sought across the chamber to invite you to join with him and he preferred what he called the greater merit of his to yours in achieving that outcome. I do not think Senator Ellison's amendment is appropriate either, nor do I think it goes to the actual point you wish to raise. I understand that point to be your conception of a principle about legal aid being really a determinant as to the level of payment and, secondly, insistence&mdash;and reasonable insistence in my view; one that I do not disagree with you on&mdash;that there should be no double dipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of what Senator Ellison is going to is another matter again. Speaking on behalf of the government&mdash;and I of course have a vested interest in this&mdash;on the plain facts of the circumstance it does not seem that you have a coincidence of interest with the coalition either. Senator Ellison in expressing his views, which he did in a quite persuasive manner as he normally does, let slip an observation which I think is revealing. That observation was that in these sorts of proceedings that Carmen Lawrence had to face up to she was in the nature of a defendant. I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show that the word `defendant' was used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in a royal commission there is no such thing as a defendant. It has been the government's argument that Carmen Lawrence has been cast in the role of a defendant. I think Senator Ellison is quite right in calling her a defendant, because that was indeed the nature of the proceedings. She was made to be a defendant. When a royal commission was supposed to be there to discover the facts she was put in the dock as someone on trial about her probity. The proceedings, to the government's mind, did not follow the processes of inquiry. Rather they followed the processes of a prosecutorial process as if there were a trial. I do not know whether Senator Ellison reflects the views of the coalition in this because this is the point the government has been making all along, but it is revealing that he should use that term in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole story is a sorry story. The government believes it should never have occurred. The $8 million or so that it has cost Western Australian taxpayers for this royal commission is a travesty and an outrage and it should never have occurred. But, because it did, there are costs of justice, and costs of justice for significant public figures in terms of their national accountability, too. The Western Australian government does not argue that that should be at commercial rates because that is the level that they have tested this in. These figures are high, but let us not fall into the populist trap of saying these figures are high and it is outrageous that they should be paid.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This raises an important consideration for the government. The government was not on trial here; Dr Lawrence was. The government made a determination to meet reasonable legal costs for her defence, but they left the selection of counsel to the person who was the subject of the royal commission, that is, Dr Lawrence. We did not intervene and decide on behalf of Dr Lawrence what we believed to be her best interest. We thought the appropriate thing was that Dr Lawrence, as the victim of these proceedings, should decide that and she made the selection of counsel, not the government. It was for her to decide on instructions to her counsel how her defence was best to be mounted. It was not for us to intervene in choosing how best to defend her interests. Indeed, it may well be on at least one view that we are not in a position to have made those choices anyway, had we been of a mind to, because the corporate knowledge of these circumstances was knowledge peculiar to Dr Lawrence and her experience.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much as I am very fond of most of those on this side of the chamber, I find something vaguely bizarre about those that they accept as public funds to be provided to Dr Lawrence and those which they do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But before I get on to that&mdash;and Senator Cook has had something to say about the commission, as well as the funding for it, in terms of relevance&mdash;I thought the commission was totally and utterly justified. I do believe that the minister for health, the then Premier of WA, indulged herself in a petition, which Mr Halden was in large part the architect of, for the purpose of deflecting from her own difficulties&mdash;including a police investigation into her use of public funds, allegedly for trips she did not take, which rested comfortably in her account for a very long time and were only refunded when the police brought it to her attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I have no time for Mr Halden. It is no shock to me that he is involved in this matter, because he tabled in the state upper house a document which claimed that I was anti-Semitic. It was a document which was a fabrication and a creation of somebody sitting behind a computer, which I thought was perhaps the most despicable sort of concoction one could have invented. Mr Halden promptly tabled it in the state parliament with my name and initials at the bottom of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe&mdash;many may disagree; anybody who has read her suicide note will understand why I say this&mdash;that Penny Easton ultimately committed suicide or was led to her death as a result of circumstances surrounding that petition and the way that it was dealt with. I find the coalition's attitude at odds with my own for these reasons; they are slightly bizarre. Recently, Mr Eoin Cameron, the member for Stirling, had published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper a statement that he was seeking from Mr Walker, the Minister for Administrative Services, part of the cost of his legal fees, which he claims amounted to $5,000, when he was inquired into by the Australian Federal Police as a result of a complaint from me stemming from blackmail threats being received by me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police found that the blackmail threats had been transmitted from the facsimile machine provided to Mr Cameron by the taxpayers of Australia in his electorate office. They also found a dirt sheet on his computer. They also established that two copies of those dirt sheets were faxed from his office to the President of the Senate, Senator Beahan, and to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also found large quantities of an unprocessed restraining order from my wife in vivid colours which was reproduced and redistributed by Mr Cameron and provided to him by Mr Viner QC, whom my wife had consulted as, she thought, a friendly lawyer. I will not go into the detail of how he improperly acquired that, the fact that the person who gave it to him is now subject to a charge under the Public Service Act of WA or the fact that Mr Viner then rummaged through the file when the clerk left the file, accidentally or by design, on the desk and then provided further information, which was the construction of a dirt sheet subsequently typed on a computer in Mr Cameron's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it odd that the Liberal Party has not disowned itself from Mr Cameron's suggestion that the taxpayers owe him a large part of his $5,000 as a result of activities which led the AFP to execute a search warrant on his office. I did not make a complaint about Mr Cameron, because he was not my first choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police said to me&mdash;I think I use their exact words when I say it this way&mdash;`Senator Crichton-Browne, these days to get a search warrant, not least on a federal member of parliament, almost requires grounds which will lead to a conviction.' They obtained in the most stringent circumstances a search warrant of his premises. The Federal Police do not seek these search warrants easily and they are not granted easily by those who have to sign off on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police then sent up a brief to the DPP looking for a prosecution, which could not succeed because it could not ultimately establish who pressed the button. I suppose it is not unreasonable to suggest that a burglar broke in, pressed the button and sent it off and nobody in Mr Cameron's office knew about it. I find no objection by the opposition about Mr Cameron seeking to use taxpayers funds to reimburse him because he suddenly decided that he needed legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, for instance, the Federal Police visited my office with a search warrant because it had been suggested that I had been sending blackmail threats to the minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), I would hand them my keys, go down the pub and say, `Ring me when you are finished.' The last thing I would do is waste money ringing up and engaging a lawyer, unless I was visited by some anxiety and doubt as to what they might find. I would then ring Mr Malcolm McCusker QC. A royal commission was set up, in my view very legitimately, yet, as I understand it, the funding that has been severed goes to the question of, for instance, privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My memory is&mdash;and I have not had time to research this&mdash;that following what was euphemistically described as the Murphy committee, which was chaired by former Senator Tate, subsequently the Minister for Justice and now ambassador to The Hague, certain evidence provided to that committee was raised and allowed as admissible evidence in, I think, the New South Wales Supreme Court. The then President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, joined the action and, on behalf of the Senate, made certain representations in respect of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could get into some dispute, I suppose, as to whether or not it is a question for the Hon. Clive Griffiths MLC, the President of the Legislative Council in Western Australia, or Senator Beahan, the President of the Senate, or perhaps more particularly the Speaker of the House of Representatives. But I have long held the view that, when matters of privilege and matters of a similar nature are raised in jurisdictions, the appropriate presiding officers have an obligation and a responsibility to ensure that the proper interests of the parliament are represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is the view of the parliament, as articulated and reflected through the Presiding Officers, there should be counsel engaged. If you were going to argue about what funding was to be provided to the present minister for health, I would have thought you might have had some dispute about the level of funding for her legal fees before the royal commission&mdash;not the question of justiciability, or jurisdiction or the general question of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, for some quaint reason&mdash;of course, of which I am not likely to be informed&mdash;the coalition have taken the view that we just chop off certain funding. I think they have chopped off the wrong funding. If we were having a debate tonight about other funding, I would find myself probably in a different circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to argue about the level of funding, it is my view that, given the seriousness of the matter&mdash;the political, moral and personal circumstances which will be visited upon Mrs Lawrence&mdash;she is entitled to seek, at the very least, quality representation. In my future litigation I will not be getting the poorest or the cheapest counsel; I will be getting counsel that can represent me in a way which provides me with the best opportunity of prosecuting my case. I think it is not an unreasonable circumstance that the same opportunity be allowed of the minister for health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I find myself, as one of my colleagues says, in a dilemma about the approach that the coalition has taken on this matter. But I would have felt much more comfortable if I had heard the coalition say, `We disassociate ourselves from Mr Cameron because he is asking for taxpayers' funds as a result of an investigation over very serious criminal matters including section 28 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act.' I think section 85Z also carries a gaol term of three years; a very serious criminal matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they had said, `That's his bag, that's his lot if he has a warrant executed upon him'&mdash;presumably the Commonwealth police are conducting themselves in a way which they are expected to, and the public are entitled to have them so do&mdash;then I would have had more sympathy to the view being put. But it is not an argument that I have heard put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my knowledge&mdash;and I might be wrong; he might have locked himself in the loo, as is the wont of those from time to time who do not have the courage to make a decision&mdash;Mr Cameron voted against the proposal that the funding not proceed. My understanding is Mr Cameron's attitude is that he should get the money and that Dr Lawrence should not. I find the logic, the morality and the integrity of that kind of quaint in my own sort of humble, inarticulate way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, I believe that the Presiding Officers&mdash;to the extent that this matter visits them, this parliament and members of it&mdash;ought to be looking at this whole question of privilege. When the rights of members of parliament or the public, or the responsibilities of the chamber, are before the courts, there is something to be said for making sure that the parliament has representation there to articulate and argue the views of the chamber. We, as I understand it, are being asked to support a proposal that makes sure we do not provide funding for that very reason. For my part at least, I find that vaguely curious. </PARA>

The law, as it stands, has plaintiffs and defendants. You will notice I did not use the word `accused' or the words `in the nature of an accused'. But when you are involved in a royal commission, a coroner's inquest or any administrative inquiry, you are not in the role of a plaintiff, certainly, but you are more in the role of a defendant. `Defendant' is a clumsy term in relation to that but, nonetheless, it is the nearest the law can get to describing the person's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose you could say that Dr Lawrence is a person who is affected by the royal commission.

<PARA>I am actually moving these amendments in honour of St Jude, who is the patron saint of lost causes, only to put on record a matter of principle. I know in advance that there is not support for this in the chamber, but I do think it is important to exert a principle. Maybe the Greens should adopt St Jude as our patron saint. We live in hope, though. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have consistently opposed the payment of Dr Lawrence's legal costs because we believe there is no precedent, legislative basis and, arguably, no constitutional grounds for making such a payment. We have never criticised Dr Lawrence on that account because we have acknowledged&mdash;I have acknowledged it before this place&mdash;that we believe the Marks royal commission was a disgraceful political exercise. We believe it was a misuse of executive power by the state government, relying upon information provided by Dr Lawrence's own adversaries within her own party. Nevertheless, we also believe that the federal government's plan to use public funds to defend this political attack is a further wrong which does not make a right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we make this payment, where does it end? We are throwing the coffers of the Commonwealth open to ministers for their unfettered use. I feel that it would be hard to argue that this is the intention of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was initially very concerned about the payment of these costs. I believe the Democrats were also, and I think Senator Spindler has referred to it. It appears that their resolve has weakened and an arrangement has now been made&mdash;or a deal been done, if you want to put it in harder terms&mdash;in the other place to pay the defence portion of the legal costs. I would be interested to hear the reasons for that position. No doubt this will occur later on when the opposition supports the amount they are prepared to contribute towards Dr Lawrence's legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have put forward a proposition that costs should only be paid at the level of legal aid. If we believe that the payment of the costs was valid in the first place, then possibly we would have been supportive of such a move. It is interesting to note that there has been no attempt to cap Mr Griffiths's costs to the legal aid level in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). The Democrats amendment helps us to see the level of privilege that is operating in this case. It shows that there is one law for the wealthy and powerful and one for all other Australians, who must rely on legal aid funding or their own resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been easy to maintain a firm stance on what the Greens see as a very important principle whether cabinet and executive decision making should be imposed upon the parliament as a fait accompli and various attempts made to force political parties, perhaps through fear of some kind of political repercussions, to support the expenditure. It has not been easy because, personally, I have not wished to identify myself with the kinds of slurs and attacks that have been made on Dr Lawrence. At times I have been cast in the role of a Western Australian woman against a Western Australian woman and I find that offensive. It has also been reported that we have sympathy for the financial burden that Dr Lawrence may have to bear if these costs are not covered and such reports are unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments have been rolled out in an attempt to obscure the questions that lie at the heart of this matter, which is why we have moved the amendments. Should the parliament establish a precedent that the Commonwealth purse, the taxpayer's purse, fund the constant slanging match between the political parties? Should we perpetuate the adversarial nature of the political culture? Should we ignore these sleazy episodes in our political history which are the product of a valueless and self-serving system? Should we ignore the warnings about the very constitutionality of making such a payment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the self-serving interests of all involved have been glossed over. For the coalition's part, the establishment of the commission and the harassment of Dr Lawrence in the parliament and the media furthered their agenda to damage the government in the lead-up to an election. The government, in turn, has sought to cast the coalition as the evil villains conducting a hate campaign against the minister. In the skirmish to gain the political advantage, both truth and justice have been eclipsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But throughout this sordid process it remains clear that there is still no basis for the parliament to make this payment. I firmly believe that the Labor Party and, in particular, the cabinet have a responsibility in this matter. The Labor Party cannot be surprised that its own avidly used political tactics have come home to roost. So long as the adversarial two-party system is maintained, these incidents will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cabinet, for their part, did a grave disservice to Dr Lawrence by leading her to believe that she would have a blank cheque for her legal costs. This is in spite of the fact that they had no authority to make such a commitment and repeatedly refused to produce any evidence that they sought legal advice as to whether she would be successful, the constitutionality of the allocation, or even any legitimisation of this appropriation. They were not even going to have it as a one line item in an appropriations account until the findings of the committee that has been looking at this matter brought it into very sharp relief that they had no possibility of gaining anything if they did not at least submit to the parliament for the use of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has almost passed from memory now, but the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee are still considering the guidelines and conditions to ensure the legality and propriety of any use of public funds to pay the legal costs of members of parliament and ministers. I hope that this at least will be a positive outcome to this disgraceful affair.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These guidelines will hopefully prevent this from happening again. It may then be that the community can have some measure of faith that the Commonwealth purse, the taxpayer's purse, will not be thrown open to parliamentarians for their unfettered use. It is for that reason that I have moved the amendments circulated in my name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition, for reasons outlined previously, will oppose these amendments in preference to the other amendments I mentioned previously. I note Senator Chamarette's comment that the government went about this in a questionable constitutional and legal sense and that the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee indeed recommended that there be a single line of appropriation. I think that was the correct method to employ in this instance and, on that basis, the manner adopted by the government is legitimate.

One of the principles that I have thought we have always stood on is that there ought to be an ability to fund the cost of justice so that justice can be done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate, as the minister said, that he has been left to look after this matter while Senator Evans is away. He has not heard me repeat this argument on many occasions. I gave it in a very abbreviated form because I have repeated it on many occasions to Senator Evans and in this chamber. I did it in August. As I have done so several times, I am not going to burden my colleagues with repeating it. I ask the minister whether legal advice was sought as to the efficacy or success of the challenge that was put up to the royal commission and, if so, would the minister table that advice?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is usually the case when such an endeavour is embarked upon, was there ever any opportunity to seek from the solicitor some kind of payment on the success of the case rather than simply payment whether or not the case succeeded?  If you are arguing that it is legitimate for the entire amount to be provided by this parliament, that it has got precedent, legal basis and constitutionality, you should also be able to justify to the people of Australia via this parliament how well you stewarded that money and ensured that it would be used in a particular way. I would be very grateful if you could tell us, having decided that it was perfectly legitimate to ask for this money from the taxpayers' purse via this parliament, what accountability you have to ensure that it was used properly, that the minimum amount was used and that you had some chance of success, because that is where your position leaves you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to respond to some other remarks that the minister has made. My reason for saying that there is no precedent is that the precedents that have always been raised to justify payment of the legal costs of ministers is that the ministers were actually engaged in the same post at the time a matter arose. However, we are dealing with a federal minister being charged in a state, under a state jurisdiction, over a matter that occurred prior to her becoming a federal minister. We have not got a precedent for that. We set precedents; we are setting a precedent. But it is quite a dangerous one. That is why there has been no precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `no legal basis' argument that I am speaking of is the one that Senator Spindler raised. The Democrats believe that it is a legitimate allocation of the money. After eight weeks, the government finally produced a justification for the payment which referred to the ministerial entitlements. Clause 4(4)(b) says that this amount is not limited to ministerial entitlements but can be expended on anything in the course of the minister's functions. What that clearly relates to is the minister's role as the minister for health. That is also the basis for questioning the constitutionality. It is an allowance that can be provided for the carrying out of her duties and functions as the minister for health. It is not an amount that is allocated to ensure her political survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler, I never meant to imply that the Democrats had changed their position. There is a disagreement between us in that you regard 4(4)(b) as a rationale that is sufficient for you to believe that payment should be made. In my view, if we take the particular interpretation that has been made of that, then we have all kinds of possibilities arising as to expenditure that ministers are entitled to have covered that does not actually occur in the course of their duties or role as minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very dangerous thing. If I were a minister&mdash;which I would never anticipate being, thank goodness&mdash;I could ask for a house or any manner of thing. If I were sued for defamation, I could ask for things on the basis that I was a minister and that I would not be able to politically survive if I were not able to pay these costs or fees. So in my view there is not a basis there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You also said that somehow we were operating on an expediency principle which defies your understanding as to motive. Maybe it is because it is not expediency at all, and there is no particular gain for standing up for something that is not supported in a popular sense. The reason we moved this amendment is that we want to put on the record that there is a view that the taxpayers' money should not have been allocated in this way. It should certainly not have been guaranteed up front. For those who believe that it was a legitimate use of taxpayers' funds, there is an onus to show how that is being spent and what endeavour was made to ensure that it would be spent properly and with due protection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We wish to oppose schedule 2, along with another two parts. I have already addressed in my speech during the second reading debate the reasons why I do not think the Senate should agree to this appropriation of $7 million. I will sum up what I said in that speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Sydney showground is public land. It is one of the very few areas of public land in what is probably the most densely populated area of Australia. Secondly, the Democrats and, indeed, the opposition have asked many questions about federal government funding of this venture at estimates hearings and outside estimates hearings. We have not received satisfactory answers to any of them. In fact, in most cases we have not received any answers at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tendering process is currently being investigated by ICAC. There is currently a legal challenge against the New South Wales government over the legal right of the Royal Agricultural Society to sign a lease with Fox and over whether a conflict of interest has tainted the allocation of the site. The impact on the surrounding area of a studio complex with tours, cinemas and restaurants is likely to be disastrous. The extra traffic in the area will be a nightmare. During peak hours the traffic in that area is already a nightmare. I can barely imagine what it will be like with an extra thousand cars a day going through. The number of new Australian jobs which was promised appears to have been enormously overstated. The amount of new Australian film and television product is very unlikely to be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no detailed list of expenditure. The processes by which the site was allocated have been legally questioned. The work to be undertaken with this money has been neither listed nor costed, and potentially severe impacts on the area have not been assessed. Under those circumstances, I do not believe we should be allocating $7 million to this project. I do not believe we should be allocating $7 to this project. I urge the committee to oppose this schedule. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) will be supporting this proposal to oppose this schedule. The reason is that we do not believe the funding was done in the proper way and we do not believe that proper process has taken place. It is not the appropriate way to spend taxpayers' money.

The Commonwealth is providing assistance of $7 million towards the cost of rehabilitating the dilapidated showground site to provide improved water supply, sewerage and drainage, communications and electricity and remove fire and asbestos risks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The film and television production industry has expressed, of course, considerable support for this proposal. The development will also bring substantial new investment to Australia and its film industry. The New South Wales government announced on 14 November this year that Fox would invest $120 million in the project over the next 11 years. The New South Wales government has also provided Fox with an incentive package largely comprising a temporary payroll tax concession. These incentives are similar to others that state governments all around Australia offer to attract investment. The concession will be available to all producers who make films on the site, not just to Fox. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direct benefit to the New South Wales economy is expected to be about $212 million per annum after five years. The New South Wales government has said that Fox will lose access to certain parts of the site if the facility fails to meet these investment levels and job targets over 11 years. This is a major project with significant benefits to the economy. The studio will produce films for the international market and be a significant export earner. Establishment of a film studio will mean that the local film industry will not have to limit its creativity and expertise to low budget movies as it has in the past. The facility will be a major asset. It will include several sound stages, a variety of post-production facilities and backlot areas for external shooting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following discussions between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Premier of New South Wales, the Commonwealth has agreed to a one-off payment of $7 million to the New South Wales government to help defray costs for site preparation and infrastructure development associated with establishing a movie studio at the existing Sydney showground site. The Commonwealth has also agreed to provide $25 million to the New South Wales government for precinct planning, design development, bulk earthworks, services diversion, site works and related costs for a new showground at Homebush as part of the state's Olympic coordinating authorities construction plans. </PARA>

<PARA>Members of the opposition may find something they recognise in this amendment. As I mentioned before, our preferred option was that this payment, which has not gone through due process, which has not gone through any particular process at all from what I can see, should not have been supported. However, the opposition clearly pointed the way. They felt that the Independent Commission Against Corruption should have the ability to look at this. If the Independent Commission Against Corruption did have the chance to look at the way the tender processes took place in relation to the proposed establishment of the Fox Film Studios and if it found that it was not a proper and lawful process then the natural extension of that is that the Senate would not be able to grant that payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very good editorial appeared on Wednesday in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> called, `Doubts on the Showground' which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Confusion over the potential worth, in employment terms, of the proposed use of the Showground site is not surprising. After all, the project is still to be properly defined. What, for example, is the exact nature of its dominant feature, the entertainment complex of cinemas, restaurants and shops? Are there to be eight cinemas or 22? These things are not clear because the proposal itself has been changing ever since it was announced by the Prime Minister in October last year as a highlight of his Creative Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's announcement, presumably to give what never has been his to give, undercut the proper process of tender. To his credit, the former State Treasurer, Mr Collins, had insisted on a tender process for such a large and important piece of public land. But since the Government changed in March, Mr Carr and his Treasurer, Mr Egan, have treated Mr Keating's handshake deal with Mr Murdoch of October last year as having settled the matter, leaving only the details to be settled with Mr Murdoch's Fox Studios Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This circumstance has tended to make secret what should have been dealt with by the public processes first of tender and then by normal planning and environment procedures. It has also led to a complaint to the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The complaint questions the probity of government action which invites expressions of interest for the site in certain terms but which then chooses to deal only with one party on quite a different basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore it certainly would not be logical if the opposition were not to support that because we are saying that the Senate could support payment of this money if it was found to be done by a proper and lawful process. But if IPAC, to which the opposition has said that they feel it should be referred, does not find that the tender was performed in a proper and lawful process, and it related to the proposed establishment of the Fox studio, surely none of us could or should support the appropriation of this money. Therefore I commend my amendment to the Senate. My preferred option was the Democrats' amendment. I cannot see any reason why the opposition would not be able to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will be supporting this amendment. It is only one part of what we would like to see before the $7 million is agreed to. As Senator Margetts said, the $7 million has been agreed to. I thank her for supporting my amendment that would have stopped that until several things had happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is this tendering process currently being investigated by ICAC, but there is also a legal challenge. There is also the fact that there is not necessarily an environmental impact statement or assessment going on, although we hope that that may still happen in the future. Judging by the way this has worked in the past, I think it is highly unlikely. We were told about 6,000 jobs; it is now down to about 550 jobs or maybe 700. The last studio that was built in Australia, at the Gold Coast, is not even making a profit yet. We cannot imagine when this one will make a profit. If it does, it will be from the restaurants and the cinemas, not from other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a great many things which have to be investigated before this $7 million is passed over to the New South Wales government. One of the most important of them is ICAC. I believe that Senator Margetts's motion is a good one. It would at least put to rest one of the problems that we have with passing over the $7 million. Unfortunately, it would not put to rest the rest of the problems, and they are very substantial.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it somewhat strange that Senator Margetts is moving this amendment on behalf of the Greens, given that the Greens did not support the coalition's second reading amendment which, I remind the Senate, expressed the opinion that the government should not disburse the moneys&mdash;the $7 million&mdash;that we are now talking about in relation to this amendment. The Greens opposed the coalition's second reading amendment that that money should not be disbursed until such time as ICAC has publicly confirmed that due process was observed in respect of the tender process for the use of the showgrounds site. These matters have been referred to ICAC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a somewhat different view from the Greens and the Democrats on this matter. I understand that both the Greens and the Democrats are opposed to the development that is being proposed here. The coalition is fully supportive of the concept of the studio being established here in Australia. The current showgrounds site has been deemed, after pretty careful examination, to be a suitable site. Equally, the move of the showgrounds from its present site as a consequence to Homebush, particularly given the proximity of the Olympic Games and the relevance of the development of that site to the games, are all very sensible procedures and concepts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only doubt that we have had in the coalition is the extent to which the Commonwealth should get involved in developments of this kind and in the financing of them, as distinct from them being more the responsibility of state governments. That is where our hesitation about the proposal has lain rather than in the more fundamental objections that the Greens and the Democrats have to the whole concept of the development of the Fox studio at the current showgrounds site and the consequential move of the showground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a big difference, in my view, between the second reading amendment that the coalition put forward and which was defeated because the Greens did not support it and the amendment now being moved in committee by the Greens. The big difference is that the second reading amendment expressed an opinion that the government should not disburse the moneys&mdash;the $7 million in relation to the present showgrounds site&mdash;until such time as ICAC has publicly confirmed that all the necessary proper processes had been observed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a big difference between the parliament expressing an opinion that the government should not disburse moneys on the one hand and on the other hand the parliament saying that these moneys `shall not be disbursed unless,' because that puts a mandatory provision into the bill relating not to appropriation but to the actual disbursement of moneys. There is a difference between appropriation and disbursement. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that is being proposed by the Greens blurs that and brings the two together in a way that is undesirable and would certainly have unfortunate precedents if it were to become a precedent, as it could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are two reasons why we do not agree with this. The second and perhaps most important is the point of that blurring, the other being that we do not have an objection to the development that the Greens and Democrats have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last Liberal government in New South Wales had, as I understand it, an open tendering process. They were down to a certain number of tenders. When the Labor government came in, they just threw it out the window. They said, `Merry Christmas, Mr Murdoch, here you go, it's yours. Don't worry about the others, we'll just stop this tendering process.' That is why ICAC is looking at it. There are many questions about this. We are not necessarily opposed to this but we want these questions answered. We want what is done with the site to be decided upon in a fair, reasonable and open way. We do not believe anything like that is happening at the moment. That is why we are opposed to giving that $7 million. I have heard what Senator Cook said; I heard almost the same at estimates. But it is not a detailed list of what should be going on at that site&mdash;what that money will be used for. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, there is a very big difference, I agree with Senator Short, between the opposition's second reading amendment and this committee amendment by Senator Margetts. The big difference, I agree, is that this amendment requires the government not to hand over the $7 million until ICAC has said it is safe to do so. I think that is a very good thing. That is why I am voting for it. The second reading amendment said, `Here's the money, here's the $7 million, do what you like with it but we suggest that you don't hand it over until ICAC says it's safe to do so.' I suggest to Senator Short that that is not the way to ensure that what you want is going to be what you get. I think this is the way to ensure that. </PARA>

These conditions include the abolition of price controls on basis foodstuffs, with some prices increasing 200 per cent in a short time; the imposition of hospital fees, supposedly to assist in decentralising health care but, due to the virtual non-existence of rural health outposts, rural people are denied access to health care; a wage freeze and possible abolition of the minimum wage, which will make life very difficult given the increasing costs of foodstuffs; a weakening of foreign investment controls, which will potentially result in balance of payments difficulties&mdash;and, heaven knows what extra environmental costs&mdash;the retrenchment of 3,000 government employees and the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised many of these concerns at the recent estimates hearings of the Economics committee last week. Unfortunately, all my worst fears were confirmed. It appears that the Australian government has accepted all the assurances from the World Bank that the structural adjustment program will be of benefit to the economy and to the people of Papua New Guinea, despite evidence elsewhere in the world that the World Bank structural adjustment programs provide dubious benefits. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Papua New Guinea government needs to listen to these people and consult more widely on these crucial issues. The Australian government needs to take a lead in encouraging the World Bank to allow such consultation and not to impose conditions on a foreign government without some form of consensus. In addition, the World Bank needs to live up to the rhetoric it produces about the need for proper consultation with non-government organisations. </PARA>

He is right but, despite repeated attempts to organise some meetings, the World Bank has failed to live up to its commitment in this regard. Whilst I am aware that this loan has already been made to the Papua New Guinea government, using the advance to the Minister for Finance, the Senate's opposition to this appropriation will send a strong message to the Australian government that the conditions of the loan are inappropriate and need to be negotiated and that, in the future, loans of this nature should receive proper parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is precisely that the Australian government is dictating conditions, and the conditions that it is dictating are atrocious. If you mean such things as dictating that they must abolish minimum wages, that they must change their economy so that rural price imposts are something like 200 per cent to 300 per cent and that people will no longer be able to eat, that is not acceptable if you are talking about sovereignty.</PARA></TALK.START>

Each parliamentarian&mdash;there are 109 of them in Papua New Guinea&mdash;now has around 600,000 kina and they can spend that in any way they like.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Margetts raised this matter because it is an important matter. I do not intend to talk very long on it at all. I have not involved myself in this debate thus far, but I do feel that this is a matter which should be given serious consideration. I understand the reason that Senator Short has indicated on behalf of the opposition that it will not support the motion. In fact, the money has been paid, as far as I know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with what Senator Margetts has said about structural adjustment programs imposed upon certain countries that eat into the very fabric of society and place heavy burdens on the poor. This is done to the extent that wages fall, incomes fall and prices go up for basic commodities such as food, clothing and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated this afternoon in the debate on the government's response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report on international financial organisations some of the problems in relation to structural adjustment programs. I indicated that even the taxation structures that are put into place do not contain the type of vertical equity, let alone the horizontal equity, that they should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you take income tax, for example, you can only tax land, labour or capital. In the case of capital, I observe that it is a moving target. If you attempt to place what the owners of the capital believe to be a too heavy burden upon them, they will shift their capital offshore. Labour can be taxed but what happens is that the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers pay the increases but the people that are getting income for their labour from another source rather than the pay-as-you-earn system are able to make arrangements to evade or avoid taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the third point which relates to land. In my view, I believe that there is too little insistence and focus on tax on land by those who develop these structural adjustment programs. I pointed this out to one person who is in a multinational financial institution and that person said that he and his family live in a very expensive suburb of Manila and they pay very little tax on their land. It just so happens that a large number of politicians also live in that particular area. The people who can afford to pay are very often the people who own the land, particularly in the metropolitan areas. They are not shouldering the burden. Again, I am concerned about the fund to which Senator Margetts adverted. That is a matter that ought to be considered very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very well aware of the problems of infrastructure in Papua New Guinea, where the people in the outlying areas cannot, in many cases, get their produce to the markets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose this amendment by Senator Margetts for very much the same reasons that Senator Short put forward. This year, we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the independence of Papua New Guinea. While that independence occurred under the Whitlam government, it was nonetheless a bipartisan decision of both major parties. It was freely acknowledged at the time that Andrew Peacock had played a significant role leading up to that independence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion does not respect the right of a sovereign power and a neighbouring country&mdash;Papua New Guinea&mdash;to make decisions about its own domestic economy. Twenty years on from independence and from Australia ceasing to be a colonial power, it seems inappropriate now at this hour of the night in the Senate to revisit imperialism. The point of this motion would be to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of Papua New Guinea has put together a comprehensive economic reform package in response to extremely difficult circumstances. Without adopting those measures, the Papua New Guinea economy faces collapse, with the burden likely to fall most heavily on the poor. Elements of the package have been agreed with by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. As the PNG finance minister has made clear, the reform program belongs to PNG, and it is in its best interests. That is an assessment that Australia shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has encouraged the PNG government to implement economic reforms and has supported the IMF and the World Bank in developing a stabilisation and economic reform program for Papua New Guinea. Australia has provided $A69.4 million in government to government loans to PNG as part of a US $111 million IMF currency stabilisation facility. The economic reform program aims to restore macroeconomic stability, which is a prerequisite for growth in production income and jobs. It also aims to liberalise the economy, lift public investment and improve public sector efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. A further key objective is the promotion of sustainable natural resource development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly turn to the poor. Both PNG and the World Bank have given considerable thought to distributional aspects of the program and have designed it to protect and advance the interests of the poor. Specific measures include locking in high proportions of government expenditure on basic health and education services; providing government services to rural areas; creating a social fund to support small-scale development activities through non-government organisational channels; developing a new anti-poverty strategy, with special attention given to the disadvantages faced by women in PNG; strengthening regulations governing forestry and fisheries; and providing more resources for monitoring and enforcement. That is part of all of this debate. For those reasons, the government opposes this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I pointed out earlier, the problem is that the nicer words of that package are not being implemented. There is nothing to say that Australia's payment of this is conditional on those things being done. It is all very well saying that we will provide funds for rural health when many rural health services do not exist. When health services are available, people are now being asked to pay for them and for basic schooling. Basically, that is what we have imposed. The bits that sound great are terrific, but they are not happening. If we talked to the people who are involved with development, they would be able to tell you that. Instead of Australia throwing the money in the air and hoping that it lands reasonably, if we ask those questions, we might be able to work out a package which does address and provide for those needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that what we have done is actually entrench conditions which will make local areas less viable and will in fact create more of the problems which we plough a lot of aid in to. What do we do in Papua New Guinea? We actually plough quite a lot of aid into providing funds for policing. Why is that policing being seen as necessary? Something like 93 per cent of the land in Papua New Guinea is still unalienated&mdash;that is, people still have the use of their land but they are being forced off it. When they are forced into the cities, there is no means for them to survive in many cases without reverting to some kind of illegal activity just to feed their families. Australia is ploughing so much money into what they call law and order schemes when in fact what we are doing is helping to create the situation which results in people taking desperate measures to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are alternative models. We have been told by people working in the non-government areas that there are alternative models. One of the things Australia does not do is actually help promote that. In recent times I have asked questions about money that has been provided to Bougainville which has not been spent. The alternative developments about Bougainville getting up and reviving their local economy have actually been dampened by the Papua New Guinea government because they would like the people in Bougainville to be continually dependent on the Panguna mine reviving. I do not see Australia taking any action to encourage that money to be spent on reviving the local economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to be saying that we are doing something to help the poor, let us actually help that to happen. Let us talk to or help communicate with the people working in those areas; do not just expect that top-down development is going to help the poor. We should look at the alternatives that exist. If we did consult in these areas of aid, we would not be ploughing the hundreds of millions of dollars that are ending up getting spent on the outcomes of what we are doing&mdash;that is, the law and order side of Papua New Guinea&mdash;instead of the grassroots development and local viability. That is the disappointment. I hear the nice words, but I do not hear anybody actually telling me whether there is anything whatsoever to indicate that any of our assistance has come to fruition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other matter concerns a question asked of me in the committee stage by Senator Chamarette when we were debating Carmen Lawrence's legal fees. She has pointed out to me that I have failed at this point to answer that question. The two questions she asked me, as I recall them, are: when the cabinet decided to back Carmen Lawrence for her legal expenses, did it seek legal advice on any challenges she might make to the legality of the royal commission; and, if we did, would we table that legal advice?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to that first question is no, we did not. The principle we held to here was that Carmen Lawrence was subject to an inquiry designed to attack her standing as a minister and that she should choose her method of defence. It was for and against her and she should decide her method of defence. That did not go to the government saying, `But you can only defend yourself this way or that way.' So the answer to the first question is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question was: did we monitor the expenditure? This was a question also asked of me, as I recall, by Senator Spindler. I replied to that question earlier this evening. In summary, the answer to that question, without going into the full detail of that reply, is no as well. </PARA>
