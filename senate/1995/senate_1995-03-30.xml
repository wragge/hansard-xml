<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We who are assembled here on the steps of Parliament House, Victoria on this day the 26th of March, 1995 hereby request that the Australian Parliament (Senate), take into consideration the following points with reference to the plight of the majority Albanian population in Kosova, which was formerly one of the eight constituent federal units of Yugoslavia prior to the disintegration of the old Yugoslav Federal Republic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On May 24, 1992, more than 80% of citizens of the Republic of Kosova, voted in free and fair multi-party elections, under the supervision of many international observers and journalists, and directly elected Dr Ibrahim Rugova as Kosova's President and also elected 130 parliamentary deputies to the Parliament of the Republic of Kosova.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a sign of protest regarding the woeful human rights situation which characterizes daily life in Kosova for the 2 million Albanian inhabitants as a result of Serbian aggression and occupation, we are appealing for understanding and support for the peaceful path which the Albanians of Kosova have chosen in order to realise their independence, whilst also respecting the political will and legitimate right for self-determination that the overwhelming majority of the citizens of Kosova</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have expressed in both popular elections and a referendum which was held in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kosova, which declared its independence in September 1990 through the legitimate organs of the Parliamentary Assembly of Kosova, and then once again confirmed through the overwhelming participation of the majority of Kosova's citizens in the successful organization of the statewide referendum in September 1991 and the multiparty elections in May 1992 and which has consistently strived to attain its political independence through peaceful and democratic means, now endures a classic system of occupation from the Serbian authorities who rule with an iron hand. Whilst acknowledging that Kosova which has more than two million citizens,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">92% of whom are ethnically Albanian, after the disintegration of Yugoslavia had the legitimate right as a formerly constitutive element in the old federation to declare independence, just like the republics of Slovenia or Macedonia.</PARA>

Call on the United Nations to use preventative diplomacy to ensure that there is no outbreak of the conflict into Kosova, which includes requesting the Serbian government to demilitarise Kosova as well as supporting the deployment of some sort of international presence in Kosova to reduce the level of repression and human rights violations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I was going to move for formality of my general business notice of motion No. 1484, which is a censure motion. I am not going to put it and I want to make a very brief statement of three points as to why I am not going to put it. When I gave notice of this motion I was very concerned about something. Attentive senators may have realised that I actually proposed a different motion earlier in this program. I was anxious about it for the reason that I did not particularly want to blow out the timetable for our last day of sitting nor gag legitimate debate which is appropriate when it is as serious as a censure motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

So, firstly, I realised there were problems in putting it on the program and proceeding to request formality for it. The second reason why I have chosen not to put it is that some Aboriginal people made contact with me expressing distress and urging me not to criticise Mr Campbell, as he listens to and supports them and is one of the few who do. </PARA>

<PARA>I have just a few remarks. Report 335 contains copies of the two finance minutes received by the committee during the 1994 calendar year. Each of the finance minutes contained in this report has already been tabled separately, but they are reproduced now in an annual consolidation for ease of future reference. The finance minutes deal with the committee's reports on an inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office and its reviews of Auditor-General's reports tabled in the period May 1991 to September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The finance minute on report 326, an assessment of tax, was tabled in parliament on 20 October 1994, together with comments by the committee. Report 326 was the result of the first major public examination of the administration of taxation laws in Australia since the enactment of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In its report the committee sought to introduce balance to a system which it saw as having grown to ignore the people it serves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When tabling the finance minute on report 326 in October last year, I noted that the vast majority of the 88 administrative recommendations had been accepted and were being implemented. I can now advise the Senate that, since that date, the committee has continued its interest and involvement in the reform process generated by report 326. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst other things, the committee announced a watching brief over the work of the tax law improvement project. The improvement project was established by the government in response to one of the key recommendations in report 326&mdash;that being that the Income Tax Assessment Act be re-written and simplified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The improvement project has already produced impressive results with its vastly simplified rewrite of the substantiation provisions of the tax law.

Report 330 contained the results of the committee's review of the 72 audit reports tabled from May 1991 to September 1992.

<PARA>The issues paper which I have just tabled is intended to stimulate public debate in the coming months about Australia's future communications requirements and how we are best able to meet those requirements in light of the rapid&mdash;in fact, explosive&mdash;changes in telecommunications technology which have taken place. Like other physical infrastructures&mdash;roads, ports and the like&mdash;our future communications network will serve as a platform supporting social interaction, education, health, government services, business activities and our communication with the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many in the community are looking to the government and to their elected representatives to play a leadership role in the new information and technology environment. Accordingly, the paper discusses a number of topical issues such as whether we should go with optical fibre technology in preference to the current hybrid coaxial cable, what sort of national information and research data we should develop and whether existing consumer safeguards are adequate given the regulatory framework we currently have. But, rather than seeking a blueprint for Australia's communications future, the paper provides a starting point and framework through which a common understanding of the key issues can be gained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of the issues paper is also important. The government is currently reviewing the duopoly arrangements with a view to introducing greater competition in telecommunications post-1997.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains the drought investment allowance and enhancements of the farm management bond scheme. These measures were first announced by the Prime Minister and Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on 8 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The five year drought investment allowance is a 10% deduction of capital expenditure incurred on investment in fodder storage, or livestock water storage, or minimum tillage equipment or all water transport facilities. There is a cap on deductions of $5,000 per taxpayer per income year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farm management bonds have been made more concessional. That measure increases the "default" investment component of farm management bonds to 100%, increases the maximum holding of farm management bonds to $150,000 for each farmer, eliminates withholding tax on withdrawal of farm management bonds, and brings the treatment of farm management bonds where a farmer ceases to be engaged in primary production into line with other repayments unrelated to serious financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was originally intended that the measures should come into effect on 1 July 1995. However, the Government brought them forward after representations from the National Farmers Federation and the Caucus Primary Industries and Resources Committee. The Treasurer announced this on 23 March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought investment allowance is now to take effect for capital expenditure incurred after 23 March 1995, the day announced in the more recent Press Release. This will give those primary producers who can incur such expenditure this financial year the opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changed arrangements for farm management bonds will now take effect on Royal Assent. The Government is seeking to speed the consideration of this bill, so that those primary producers who can make deposits of farm management bonds this financial year may have the opportunity to do so to the maximum level.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Drought investment allowance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought investment allowance provides an incentive for primary producers to invest in items that will increase their drought preparedness. It applies to capital expenditure incurred after 23 March 1995 and the items of property to which it applies must be first used to produce assessable primary production income, or installed ready for such use, by 30 June 2001. The allowance, deductible in the year the item of property is first used, will be at a rate of 10 per cent and will be additional to depreciation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought investment allowance will operate similarly to the general investment allowance that ceased application at the end of June last year. To qualify, the items of property must be fodder storage facilities, or livestock water storage facilities, or minimum tillage equipment, or facilities for the transport of water. The taxpayer may incur expenditure on any one or more of these items but cannot incur expenditure in excess of $50,000 on items first used or installed ready for use in a particular year of income and claim the full allowance for all of it. The items of property must be for use in Australia to produce primary production assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The property must be retained by the primary producer for at least 12 months and must not, in that period, be made available for use by other persons. The allowance can be withdrawn at any time if property is acquired or constructed by the primary producer with the intention of dealing with it in a disqualifying manner even after the first 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought investment allowance will be available to leasing companies if lessees contract to use the property for not less that four years. Leasing companies will have the option to transfer some or all of their entitlement to the allowance to the lessee of the property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those primary producers who wish to claim the drought investment allowance on the installation of water storage facilities and water transport facilities must have an approved water conservation plan in place to be eligible for the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of such a plan is to help the primary producer in preparing the farm to survive drought better in ways that minimise any adverse effects that the installation of water storage and water transport facilities might have both on the primary producer's farm and on the environment of which the farm is a part. A plan ensures there are no significant adverse effects on water quality or availability off the farm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Farm management bonds</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of the amendments to the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976, farm management bonds will become more attractive to farmers. Farm management bonds provide a greater return if they are repaid to meet certain sources of serious financial difficulties including commodity price collapse and drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments increase the proportion of the deposit which attracts interest to 100 per cent, farmers will be able to hold up to $150,000 in farm management bonds, and the 20 per cent withholding tax that was imposed on withdrawals of farm management bonds has been removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When farm management bonds are not repaid because of serious financial difficulties caused by a commodity price collapse or by drought, disease, fire, flood or the like, they are repaid only as ordinary income equalization deposits. Deposits made after these changes may be repaid on the retirement of the primary producer from primary production only as though those deposits were income equalization deposits and so will have earned a lower level of interest. This brings the treatment of repayment of farm management bonds on the retirement from primary production of a primary producer into line with repayment of farm management bonds in other situations where there is no collapse of commodity prices or other disaster.</PARA>

<PARA>This report came about as a result of Sydney gaining the 2000 Olympics. It will come as no surprise to the Senate that the estimated cost of the Olympic Games will be somewhere in the region of $1.7 billion. Of that, the Commonwealth contribution will be $150 million and the contribution by the New South Wales government will be $30 million. Revenue from the games is estimated at $454 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not normally advocate regulation of this nature in the marketplace. I much prefer a free market. In this case, we have an unusual situation involving one event that is of great moment and cost. Therefore, it has to be looked at very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received 35 submissions in relation to its inquiry. It took evidence at public hearings in Sydney on 12 September last year. Submissions were received from a range of interested parties, including the Sydney Olympic Games Organising Committee and the New South Wales government. The central issue was whether the Commonwealth should provide additional protection to the organisers of the Sydney 2000 games for the olympic words and symbols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant problem facing the Olympics organisers is ambush marketing. Ambush marketing refers to the unauthorised association by businesses of their products for the marketing of a sporting event without paying for those rights. It goes without saying that the Sydney Olympics would be a prime target for such ambush marketing. I refer to the action between Visa and American Express over the Albertville Winter Olympics in 1992. Visa had the sponsorship of the games, and it was alleged that American Express tried to encroach on it and unfairly advertise in relation to that event. So legislation was needed in that instance to protect the substantial investment by Visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the coin is the question of balance. A sporting or charitable group might in a harmless way use something which could be associated with the games. It, too, might suffer some legal sanction. I refer to page 94 of the report, which stated that recipients of letters from the Canadian Olympic Trust, which was entrusted with protecting the olympic words and symbols, included a men's amateur hockey team at Scarborough in Ontario and a Toronto bicycle shop for using stick-man logos similar to the official olympic symbols. Similarly, the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Canada was forced to drop the stick person symbol it had used for over six years. That could well be an example of where this can go too far. That is where we really need to strike a balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem that the committee heard of was a system for gaining injunctive relief to stop someone using improperly an olympic word or symbol. At the moment, I suggest that there is some convoluted process in relation to such an application. It was submitted that there should be legislation which can afford quick release so that one can stop unauthorised advertising in its tracks and seek corrective advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was convinced that existing laws are inadequate to meet the special circumstances of the games. This opinion is based on the legal advice the committee received in relation to current legislation. In all, the committee has made 17 recommendations on the additional measures which it believes should be taken to protect olympic words and symbols. The committee has recommended specific purpose legislation to protect olympic related expressions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is of the view that, without additional measures, there is a likelihood that not only will ambush marketing of the Sydney games occur on an unprecedented scale but also that this will be to the detriment of the game's organisers' budget and, in turn, could have ramifications for the taxpayers of Australia. The committee also recommended that specific purpose legislative measures be introduced to facilitate the Olympic organisers' abilities to seek and obtain urgent injunctions and also that there be corrective advertising. If someone does transgress the provisions of this legislation, then they would have to place corrective advertising in order to remedy the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next to the report there is a schedule dealing with those expressions which would be considered as impinging on the phrase `Olympic words and symbols'. For instance, it stated that the words `Olympic' and `Olympics' should not be used in conjunction with the words `games' `gold', `medals', `millennium' or `summer'. If you have a combination of those words, they could well represent an association with the Olympic Games. On their own there might not be any trouble with them, but once you get them combined you have this representation that they are associated with the Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also add that there are some businesses presently which use the word `Olympic'. I refer to Olympic Tyres and the Olympic Coffee Cafe. It is intended that they should remain. There should be no interference with the use of that word in those cases. Those businesses have been using those words for some time, and the running of their business should not be disrupted. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to pay a huge tribute to the committee's secretariat. This committee, along with its sister committee&mdash;the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee&mdash;is probably the hardest working committee of the Senate. We continually get references from the Senate to look at legislation, with very tight guidelines which we are not always able to meet. The secretariat does a phenomenal job in assisting the members of the committee and in assisting the committee as a whole to meet their obligations to the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of the Olympic symbols, and the protection of them, is of deep interest to the city of Sydney and to the state of New South Wales. As a Western Australian senator, and as a member of the committee, I felt that there was a broader interest in this matter. Whilst we have not accepted all of the suggestions that came from SOGOC, the planning committee for the games, my mind has been perhaps influenced to a certain extent by the fact that there is an Australian investment in those games, not just a Sydney or a state of New South Wales investment. Indeed, the Commonwealth government has pledged $150 million to assist the games. I do believe that each state, in particular the outlying states&mdash;Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia&mdash;ought to be in a position to benefit from the games, but they ought not to be in any way intrusive of, and interfering in, the marketing that must go on to raise the enormous amount of money that is required to ensure that the games are a success. </PARA>

Nonetheless, I think we have reached a happy medium and a good balance in the recommendations that we have put forward. We put forward those recommendations in an environment in which there is a strong push to deregulate.

My colleagues on the committee know the reason for that. I disqualified myself from sitting on that committee for the purposes of this hearing so as to ensure that there could be no allegation of conflict of interest. The reason being that the sporting discipline I have represented this country in for a number of years and will continue to represent this country in is subject to consideration by the IOC for return to the Winter Olympics either in 1998 or 2002.

That was much appreciated as far as I am concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in recommendation No. 6, one of the 16 very well prepared recommendations, the committee recommends protection of words combined with other words&mdash;that is, for instance, a word out of list A combined with a word out of list B. For example, olympic city, millennium paralympics, millennium paralympian or millennium olympian would be protected. I do not think many people would have concerns about that. The question is exactly how the combination of words should be defined. Is it simply one word followed by another&mdash;for example, olympic city or olympic sponsor&mdash;or would that protection be drafted so widely as to catch, say, a phrase like sponsor of our olympic athlete X. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is my concern. The difficulty for young athletes in this country is getting sponsorship to meet their training requirements. The cost of training and competing these days is increasingly expensive. The difficulty for young athletes is that they have to hold out a light at the end of the tunnel for the sponsor and say, `I may only be competing in the Australian age championships now, but in four or five years time I could well be on my way to the Olympics.' That is the dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you preclude a sponsor from using a loose grouping of words&mdash;for example, sponsor of olympic athlete X&mdash;at any point in the future, then what you do is preclude the opportunities for young athletes to get the sponsorship which will get them through the next three, four or five years and make them an athlete of olympic quality. I think it is important that consideration be given to that matter otherwise all we will do is cheat our young athletes out of the opportunity to properly develop and we will cheat our country out of gold medals in the year 2000 as well as having unintended consequences on Winter Olympic athletes in 1998 and 2002. </PARA>

<PARA>Senators will recall that in August last year the Senate agreed that the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee should inquire into and report upon the impact of assets tests on farming families' access to social security payments and Austudy. It was basically at the instigation of Senator Woodley and Senator Boswell, who had been pushing for something to be done about this for quite some time, albeit a lot of other people were concerned about what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first report deals with Austudy assets tests and farming families&mdash;a matter that attracted considerable comment in submissions to the inquiry. The committee's report reviews Austudy provisions&mdash;including the assets tests&mdash;examines its impact on farming families and notes specific concerns raised in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the amount of information that we received and the amount of work that was done, we should pay a special tribute to the secretariat of John O'Keefe, Ms Hawkins, Mrs Migus, Neil Bessell, and particularly Peter Hallahan, who did most of the work on this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to be eligible for Austudy, a student must jump two hurdles. The first is the assets test&mdash;the limit for which is currently $369,350. Do not forget that that is not the students' assets; it is the parents' assets. Farms and businesses receive what the Department of Employment, Education and Training describes as a 50 per cent discount. In effect, this means that the value of the assets for farmers is $738,700&mdash;double the standard limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second test that applies is the income test. Under this test, maximum benefits are available for taxable incomes up to $21,300 and then on a sliding scale to approximately $40,000 taxable income per annum. The living allowances available under Austudy depend on the status of the student. A dependent student aged 16 to 17 years receives $3,449, whereas an independent student married with a child receives $6,917. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on the evidence presented by DEET, it would be very easy to draw the conclusion that the assets test has a minimal impact on access to education, particularly for farming families. The department advised the committee that, in relation to unsuccessful Austudy applications from rural areas in 1994, only one per cent failed on the basis of the assets test, while 72 per cent failed on the basis of the income test. However, as the department itself recognised, the statistics reflect only those students who submitted applications for assistance. Also, the department's statistics relate to applications from rural areas but do not show those exclusively for farming families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, therefore, was interested to receive, and has included as an appendix to its report, unpublished data from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy which shows the impact of the Austudy assets test on farming families regardless of whether or not they applied for assistance. DPIE advised the committee that, if the assets test excluded farm assets while retaining a test on off-farm assets&mdash;I stress that point: it would retain a test on off-farm assets&mdash;an additional 5,400 students from farming families would be eligible for Austudy. In simple terms, this means that 5,400 students from farming families who meet the income test for Austudy are being denied assistance for their education solely on the basis of parental assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the data provided by DPIE is in stark contrast to the Treasury's view that the assets test is a generous test as it has removed only the wealthiest families from Austudy. Not only does the evidence of DPIE call into question the economically rational pronouncements from Treasury, but the overwhelming opinion expressed in the 260 submissions lodged with the committee is that the Austudy assets test is a blunt policy instrument which effectively denies a sector of the Australian community access to education opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence maintains that the assets test is not an appropriate indicator of a family's immediate ability to meet the costs of educating their children. This is because farming is a capital intensive industry in which most assets are fixed and cannot be readily liquidated without diminishing the viability of the industry. I think there are many cases where you can say that farmers are asset rich but income poor. If we look at broadacre farms at the moment, we will see that the average income is something like minus $17,500. If we look at the assets of those farms, they might sound rich but they cannot just sell off the back paddock very easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report considers the Austudy assets test as not only a blunt instrument but also an inappropriate instrument which determines farming families' access to educational opportunities. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that farm assets should be excluded from the Austudy assets test. This recommendation is based on several considerations which are noted in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my strong personal view, which I am pleased is reflected in the committee's report, that it is important in the national interest that farming families have access to educational opportunities in order for this protective sector to remain competitive and technologically innovative. In our rural adjustment scheme report we made recommendations to the effect that if we are going to have a better farming community we have to have a better educated farming community and for people to have a better chance of readjusting off the farm they need to be able to go to universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying what I have just said, neither I nor the farming sector expect special treatment. What I believe is essential and what the farming community asks for is a fair go&mdash;something they are not getting because of the Austudy assets test. Basically, my position and the position of the  committee is that education is a right, not a privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making the recommendation, the committee was mindful of budget implications. We were advised that it would cost a maximum of $15 million to have the farm assets removed from the Austudy assets test. This may seem a lot of money but, after all, we are dealing with the future of young Australians. I suspect that $15 million would represent about one per cent of the overall budget for student financial assistance. In terms of the bigger picture, I would also suspect that some of the 5,400 students who have been identified by the DPIE as having been excluded from Austudy may well receive more costly yet less enriching government assistance through other programs and services, for example, jobsearch or jobstart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult for anyone on these committees to divorce themselves from strong political or economic considerations. In relation to this report, I must admit that as the chairman I had no such difficulties. The fundamental consideration in this report is equitable access to educational opportunities. As I said, education is a right, not a privilege. Equity needs to be extended to farming families. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that I am delighted to be able to contribute to the discussion on this latest report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. This report deals with the impact of the assets test on the access of farming families to Austudy. As all senators in this place will be aware, this is an issue that the Australian Democrats have been pursuing for over four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1990 my colleague Senator Lees moved an amendment to a social security bill to exempt the value of the family farm from the assets test which applied to the family allowance supplement. On at least eight further occasions since that amendment of Senator Lees the Democrats have attempted to exempt farm tools of trade from the Austudy and social security assets tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent instance of this was an amendment I moved on behalf of the Democrats to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. That amendment sought to exempt the family farm from the assets tests which apply to the basic and additional family payments. It was in response to my amendment that this committee of inquiry was originally established. Soon after submissions were called for to that inquiry it became obvious that the committee needed to look beyond just those assets tests on the family payment and to consider all social security payments as well as the student assistance payment, Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the terms of reference for the committee's inquiry were subsequently broadened by a notice of motion moved by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Meg Lees. Following the incorporation of Senator Lees's motion into the terms of reference, the committee was required to inquire into and report on the impact of the assets test on farming families' access to all social security payments and to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given our record, senators will understand when I say the Democrats feel not only a sense of having been vindicated by the major recommendation of this report but also a sense of frustration that it has taken so long for the Senate to realise what the Democrats have known for years. The recommendation which appears on page 22 of this report is straightforward. It simply states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that farm assets be excluded from the AUSTUDY assets test.</PARA>
<PARA>We are pleased, I must say, to see this recommendation put to the government and we feel and hope that the government will accept it. It would be remiss not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to extend my thanks to the committee for the marvellous job that it did on this report. The great concern in the community over the issue of the access of farm families to Austudy and social security payments was clearly reflected in the fact that the committee received over 250 submissions. These included various rural counselling groups, the Independent Schools Parents Council of South Australia Inc., the Western Australia Minister for Community Development and the Family, Australian Women in Agriculture and a large number of church groups, including the Australian Conference of Leaders of Religious Institutes and the National Anglican Caring Organisations Network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the submissions were highly critical of the current assets test as it affects farming families and a large proportion of the submissions made extensive reference to the Austudy assets test. The Australian Cane Farmers submitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTUDY is the benefit that most farmers resent being excluded from. Perhaps this is because they see education as a means of their children being able to get out of the economic uncertainty they have grown up with.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assets test means our kids work most weekends and holidays&mdash;for no pay, seldom have the pleasures of urban children, and are well used to hand me downs.</PARA>
<PARA>In submission No. 215 the Woodhouse Woolgrowers Group said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tertiary education is the greatest strain of all because rural children simply have no choice but to board away from home if they wish to pursue higher educational opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>I could read from many other submissions and I have a number of other quotes, but I am aware of the pressure of time. Time does not allow me to place any more quotations on the record. Senators who are interested in rural Australia should read these submissions. They would meet face to face the real suffering of rural people. Access to education is a basic right and children from farming families must have the same opportunities that other children receive and government encouragement to continue their studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to leave the Senate with the words of Mr and Mrs Blake, a farming couple from Shelford in Victoria who saw the issue of Austudy assets test in a broader context and that is whether or not the government has any commitment to the maintenance of rural communities. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators I believe that Australians must make decisions very soon as to whether they want a viable rural community&mdash;to continue to have family farms with people who love and care for their land or if they want to see young people leaving for the much easier more comfortable life offered by urban dwelling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to comment on the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report on the impact of the assets test on farming families and their access to social security and Austudy. As Senator Brownhill has pointed out, this aspect of the report deals with the provision of Austudy. The nature of farm assets in themselves means that farmers are usually asset rich and income poor, given the fluctuating nature of their income, particularly over the last four years in Australia which have seen probably the worst ever drought. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Urban families do not have to put so much capital into their assets in the sense that the family home is exempted from the assets test and the home in the city or in the town is often where capital is used. So it is possible to have an extremely expensive home&mdash;in the sense that a lot of capital has been invested in it&mdash;yet still be eligible for Austudy. On the other hand, farming families who possess broadacres of land are ruled out of being eligible for Austudy because of the nature of their assets. Farm families use their capital to build up the productive nature of their assets. If they are to retain their farm and use it for the benefit of future generations, they must plough their capital back into their land. They are penalised for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Brownhill said, the net value of the assets that apply to farming families to determine eligibility for Austudy is $738,700. In Victoria in particular, which is my home state, many productive farms have land worth much more than this, because Victorian land values are higher than other states and you do not need to have a very big farm to have farming land worth over that amount. Even in the drought many of the farming areas in Victoria are not eligible for the drought relief payment because they are not considered to be within the negative rainfall criteria given by the government to access the DRP. So farmers are neither eligible for that nor eligible for other welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that representatives of the rural adjustment scheme have made only two visits to Victoria, both to irrigation areas. They have not even been to look at whether other farming areas in Victoria should be considered for drought relief payments. So those farmers are not considered to be affected by the drought when in fact they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not wish to dwell on the negative side of this in so far as how many farmers we should possibly get onto welfare payments or social security. I would like to look at the positive aspect of providing education to equip children for the challenges of the 21st century. Education, as Senator Woodley has correctly outlined, should be a right for children. It is an undeniable fact that children of farming families do not go on to tertiary education in the same numbers as children from cities and towns. We need a well trained, well educated work force for the future not only for the many farm children who go on to other areas of employment away from the farm but also for those employed on the farm itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers themselves need to be better educated to cope with the challenges of a technological farming future. Australia's farm managers and farm owners are an ageing group. As a group in their past lives they have not had access to tertiary education and, in many cases, to a higher secondary education. Many of them, and I have spoken to them about this, would like to see a much brighter future for their children in so far as they want their children to be better educated to have better farms in the future. We need to provide Austudy for those children so that they can move away from their farm environment and go on to tertiary studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best form of welfare is a job. Education will lead to this, even if the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) does not believe it. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy estimated that, if farm assets were excluded from the assets test but off farm assets were retained, as Senator Brownhill said, an additional 5,400 children would be eligible. Even if one child were to be eligible because of the removal of the assets test, it would give that child&mdash;or the 5,400 children&mdash;a better chance of attaining an education. This is not taking into account those students who did not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also received a deal of evidence to lead us to believe that confusion abounds among rural families as to the exact nature of the assets test. Many families do not know whether or not they are eligible to receive Austudy. There is also a lack of information about Austudy provided through government information outlets. There are complex application procedures which mean that many people are put off applying. Farmers and their families, from the evidence we received, are often ruled in to receive Austudy for one year of their child's studies and in the next year, because of better commodity prices being obtained from what they produce, are then ruled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot let a student embark on a tertiary degree course for three or four years without knowing whether that child will receive Austudy for the entire three or four years of a course. Students need to know that they will be receiving it for the three or four years. They do not need to have Austudy for one year, be ruled out the next year, and so on. That leads to enormous economic uncertainty not only for the students but also for their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which Austudy is provided is not the only factor that works against rural participation in tertiary education. I realise that some of these are endemic because of the fact that rural people do live a long way away from capital cities. These factors include travelling costs. Also, there are living away from home costs for tertiary students. To reside in a university residential college for one academic year entails a cost of around about $9,000. For students who want to reside in private rental accommodation, the cost is even greater&mdash;starting, I would estimate, at around about $10,500. We need to provide these students with the wherewithal to at least go to the cities, gain their tertiary education, even if they have to supplement Austudy with a part-time job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost will no doubt be touted by the government as a factor against implementing what we have recommended in the report&mdash;which is, to remove the assets test. The Department of Employment, Education and Training estimated that the cost of excluding farm assets would be $15 million. When we consider some of the other items of government expenditure that are perceived by the Prime Minister and the cabinet as being absolutely essential, such as the refurbishment of the Prime Minister's private plane&mdash;and I note a report in this morning's papers of a plan by Mr Bilney to send journalists overseas on further education at government expense, and we are talking about private sector journalists here&mdash;I do not feel that $15 million is too much to pay for the cost of giving rural students access to tertiary education, a right that is enjoyed by every other student in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If our recommendation to remove the assets test were to be implemented, it would be an acknowledgment by the government of the difficulties being faced by rural families in the present environment. It would also be an acknowledgment by this government that all Australians are to be treated equally, regardless of where they live or what their aspirations are in life. Therefore, I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to comment on this report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. I have agreed to keep my contribution short because of pressures of business. It is tragic that when reports such as this inevitably come down in this place we find ourselves pressured to such a point that they cannot be given proper attention, but I know there will be other opportunities. I want to reinforce some of the points that have been made by my colleagues about the impact of the assets test on farming families. I am a recent convert&mdash;I confess&mdash;to the position adopted by my colleagues. I also recognise the position adopted by the government members of the committee. Senator Forshaw just rose to his feet to make the point that there was a dissenting report. The government members, as well, recognise in their recommendations that there is a problem with the assets test, although they were not prepared to take the quantum leap of recommending it be abolished. I hope they follow it through and get some action on the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 5,400 potential farming families students are affected by the assets test. A total cost of some $15 million would be needed to overcome it out of the total budget of $1.4 billion which is currently spent, as I understand it, on Austudy. Something most people do not understand is that the problem of being income poor and asset rich is not easily overcome. There is no way you can go out and sell the back paddock. You cannot sell your income earning resource, whether it be sheep, cattle or a tractor because, once you do that, you are on the road to oblivion. So you have to look at it somewhat differently to other aspects of assets testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum of $738,000 of net assets might seem like a lot of money, and to a lot of people it is a lot of money, but the problem is the way assessments are made by financial institutions to determine whether you can borrow against that net asset. To endeavour to put it in simple terms, you can have a property that has a gross value of $1.5 million&mdash;just to pick a figure out&mdash;and you can have debt of $500,000, which means you have net assets of $1 million. The problem is that when financial institutions assess the capacity of people to borrow against that, they take a stress value of two-thirds, which immediately means that the stress value of that property is $1 million. They then look at the $500,000 debt against that and totally rule out any capacity to borrow money against that for the education of farming families' children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scenario I have put is fairly common. It does not matter much whether you use the $1.5 million or a $2 million gross value, you seem to find that the debt level is between 33 or 34 per cent and 40 per cent. But for borrowings for personal requirements the test from the financial institutions is much harder. So as a consequence you have this relatively small group of people who are ruled out of being able, when they are income poor, to get the money required to educate their children. That is an anomaly, an unintended consequence, of the assets test and where it sits. It disadvantages a small group of people significantly. It also runs in the eye of the thrust, which I believe most if not all people support, in the farm sector that we need to have better educated young people remaining in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against the $15 million we mentioned before and the research that was done through DPIE and others there will be a significant offset of young people who receive social security. We have not got a figure for that but certainly in some areas&mdash;I can nominate some areas in Western Australia; however, it is probably better from the point of view of the districts concerned that I don't&mdash;where over 50 per cent of the rural youth receive some social assistance because their families have no money to pay them, there are no jobs in the area and there is little point in their heading for the city because with their level of education they have little or no hope of getting a job. So it is an enormous social problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 107. I will read it into the record. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be understood that, in keeping with its terms of reference, the Committee's conclusions and recommendations are confined to farming families. Therefore, the Committee has not addressed more general issues such as the application of the AUSTUDY assets test to businesses other than farms. Nevertheless, the Committee anticipates that this issue will be addressed by the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee in its broader inquiry into AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I draw attention to that is that I think it is important that that other group of people out there who have the same problem with periods of being income poor but relatively asset rich know they have not been ignored by this report&mdash;it was just that they were not included in the terms of reference&mdash;and the issue will be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note some figures we were given in terms of that group. If the assets test were removed for those who would qualify, the additional cost would be about $5 million. So we are not talking about a lot of money, but we are talking about a group of young people who I believe are being severely disadvantaged in terms of access to quality education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important report. It is not possible to do justice in the time available to the detail of the report, so I simply want to make some general comments and elaborate at a later point on its precise contents. I begin by thanking the committee secretariat: Peter Keele, committee secretary; Robert King, who was secretary in the initial stages; Janice Paull, principal research officer; Sarah Bachelard, senior research officer; Dr Pippa Carron, principal research officer; Christine Tieu, executive assistant; and Winifred Jurcevic, the executive assistant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that they worked well beyond the call of duty. Indeed, in many respects they are probably much more exhausted than we are, the highlight of that being that they worked until 4 a.m. the other day in order to meet the Senate imposed deadline. I pay public tribute to their efforts. I found them to be extraordinarily cooperative and enthusiastic. I hope they enjoyed the exercise as much as we did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make mention of another matter that is of particular concern. All members of the Senate committee are appalled at an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today which referred to a suggestion that senior ABC managers had acted dishonestly in their dismissal of Pamela Bornhorst. That is factually incorrect. I think we all want to make it very clear that we take it very seriously that some person or persons presumably provided that information to a journalist on whatever basis. We want to utterly dissociate ourselves from those remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has a very strong commitment to the ABC as one of Australia's vital national cultural institutions. I have no doubt that it will continue to deserve the support of all Australians. The ABC has had a special place in the hearts of the community now for more than 60 years. It is a long and honourable history and it is vitally important that the ABC remains as an independent quality alternative to the commercial radio and television networks in the decade ahead. Australia certainly needs a fearlessly fair, impartial and independent ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the forces of darkness are constantly at hand, whether in the form of political interference, board stacking, or commer</PARA>
<PARA>cial interest wanting a free, or indeed a paid, run. Therefore, the ABC must be constantly on its guard to protect itself against threats to its independence and impartiality. Where necessary, the parliament, which currently provides $515 million on behalf of the taxpayers each year, must be equally vigilant to ensure that the ABC does not compromise itself and that it maintains its independence and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senate committee comprised members of all political parties. It is the first major public inquiry into the activities of the ABC since the Dix report of some 14 years ago. The inquiry came about as a direct result of Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program of 18 September last year. Indeed, it is fair to say that even in the period of little over six months since that time, a virtual torrent of water has flowed under the bridge with the departure of the managing director, the director of television, with two reports from Mr George Palmer QC, with the decision taken to scrap infotainment programs and with the appointment of Mr Ian Macphee to the board, undoubtedly a token Liberal counterbalance to the very gross board stacking that we have seen in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that even in the time the committee has been sitting, it has certainly achieved a considerable amount. I pay tribute to: my fellow committee members, particularly my colleagues Senators Tierney and Chapman but also Senators Bourne and Chamarette and Senators Carr and Forshaw; the printing office and the Sound and Vision Office; and the ABC for not only providing us with detailed submissions and supplementary submissions but also answering innumerable questions and providing us with the information that is necessary in order to ensure as best one can that the report truly reflects the facts and circumstances of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of aspects of the ABC's operations are touched on in the report. I think it is fair to say that the common thread that runs through the report is the impact of commercialisation and commercial activities. In many respects it can be said that that relates to the budget pressures that  have been on the ABC and, of course, on a number of other publicly funded institutions. It is a function of pushing the barriers to engage in a number of new commercial activities, which often have taken the ABC into unchartered waters, and the compromises and pressures that are always there on a public broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have canvassed not only Australian television and pay television but also the continuing gravitation towards Sydney as the centre of Australia. We have expressed concern that the ABC should, under its charter, reflect cultural diversity and, as much as possible, regional representations so that we do not have just one view of the world. Much as we would all like our own views to prevail, the fact remains that they will not. Therefore, it is very important in a democratic society to have a diversity of views and opinions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have touched on staff-management relations. We think there is considerable scope for improvement there. We are mindful of the fact that only those with grievances come before a public committee. Nonetheless, that in itself was a courageous act in a number of respects. It certainly reflects a level of discontent that needs to be addressed by management. I have already commented on the stacked nature of the board, which at one stage saw six out of nine members with past or present ALP affiliations. We are therefore very supportive of the ABC, but we believe that there is scope for a number of changes to ensure that it remains vital and strong in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the minority report incorporated in the document in the names of Senator Carr and Senator Forshaw, which has only come to my attention this morning. I have not had an opportunity to read it in any detail. Chapter 4 refers to the chairman's initial draft report. I also see a statement in the second paragraph that the chairman completely rewrote the entire report and its recommendations. Not only is that absolutely and manifestly untrue; it would seem to me that that is a clear breach of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators who have been in this place for more than five minutes know that a private meeting of a committee is just that and that it is normal practice for committees to consider draft documents. Indeed, the chairman's draft is the common term used in that process. It is then on the table for all members of the committee to contribute to it. They have an opportunity to correct any inaccuracies and to add to it. But to refer to what is a private process in that way seems to me on the face of it to be a very clear breach. I am simply giving notice that I will be pursuing this matter further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no reason to think Senator Forshaw is the prime mover in this little effort. I expect Senator Carr to apologise for the utterly untrue statement that the entire report and its recommendations were rewritten at the 11th hour. I also call on Senator Carr to explain why a reference to what occurred in private session is not a breach of privilege. I also find it offensive in the extreme to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that the report reflects the true views of the Opposition in relation to the ABC and its role as the national broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA>There is not a skerrick of evidence to support the proposition. It is simply put in the report in stark print. It seems to me to show the desperation of some people to politicise and discredit by whatever means are available to them and to resort to whatever tactics, however dubious, to effect that end. I look forward to both an apology and an explanation. I give notice that I will be taking advice about the reference of this matter to the privileges committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Forshaw and I agreed to participate in this select committee in the full knowledge that it was a kangaroo court set up to condemn the ABC. We did so because we believe that it is part of our responsibilities as senators to defend citizens and institutions targeted for such a witch-hunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the opposition's view, the corporation's crime is very straightforward: it is competing too effectively with the private media cartels not only in traditional areas such as radio and television but also in areas such as pay TV and the wire services. The ABC has increased its radio audience by 62 per cent and its television audience by 26 per cent since the late 1980s. It has done so through quality programming with more Australian content than ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, it has launched Australia Television International to offer a satellite service into Asia and Broadcast News Australia to offer a news wire service to subscribers around Australia in direct competition with AAP. These successes are putting pressure on private networks, and they do not like it. Sure, there is something that the champions of the free enterprise system in this country could do about that, and they have. Members of the Liberal Party have run a campaign of smear and disinformation to create the impression that the ABC is in crisis. They have used their own propaganda as the pretext for a Senate inquiry and to make a series of recommendations that would render the corporation totally uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government agreed to be part of this committee only on the basis that it felt a responsibility to keep the bastards honest, and that is exactly what we have done. Given the way things started, I have to confess that we were not all that optimistic about our chances of getting justice in the end. But this inquiry was politically motivated from the outset. The opposition was quite clearly prepared to sacrifice the ABC's reputation in the pursuit of some chimerical political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that the opposition members of the committee had already made up their minds about the issues they were purporting to investigate before the inquiry began. Senator Alston has been enriching the public record for some years with his diatribes against the ABC and its former managing director. He clearly saw this inquiry as a heaven-sent opportunity to vent his hostility towards the corporation. This is why the opposition was so keen to stack the committee, which had only two government members out of the seven on this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition were furnishing themselves with utterly scandalous terms of reference which took it for granted that the ABC was marked by `failure', `controversy' and `conflict' and that these were symptomatic of some `dysfunction', some `deep-seated problem', that was causing universal `concern'. This is why members opposite flouted the standing orders, with Senator Alston careering around like a loose cannon and acting without the committee's authority. That is why those opposite made one outrageous demand on the ABC after another, blithely requesting truckloads of documents they never intended to read about events they had no intention of ever investigating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why those opposite extended the deadline for submissions when it became clear that no-one was taking much interest in their antics. That is why they went around on the inquisitorial equivalent of the gutter crawl, trying to solicit submissions from anyone they could think of who had a grudge against the ABC. That is why those opposite allowed the committee's time to be wasted on peripheral matters like the dismissal of television presenter Pamela Bornhorst&mdash;matters that would have been more appropriately dealt with in the letters pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">TV Week</EMPHASIS> rather than the Australian Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why those opposite accepted submissions and testimonies that had absolutely nothing to do with the terms of reference. That is why they consistently flaunted the provisions of the Senate parliamentary privileges resolutions relating to adverse evidence. That is why they gave witnesses with personal axes to grind free rein to vent themselves on the ABC. That is why they allowed the disgruntled and vindictive to make unsubstantiated and often highly slanderous accusations about individuals under parliament privilege. That is why they gave the victims of these attacks no opportunity to respond and allow their side of the story to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as witch-hunts go, this one has been a real dud. Despite the fact that the whole inquiry has been predicated on the presumption of the ABC's guilt, not one of the allegations found in the terms of reference has been proven. The ringleaders of this inquiry may have failed in their primary objective of bringing the ABC into public disrepute, but they have succeeded in making the Senate and its committee system the object of ridicule and contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government members of this committee want to put on record our complete lack of confidence in this sham inquiry and our support for the ABC, its staff, its management and its board. Our faith in the ABC is shared by the government as a whole, which has demonstrated its commitment by giving the corporation triennial funding since 1988, by steadily increasing its funding in real terms since 1988-89, by earmarking $1.5 billion for ABC activities over the next three years to 30 June 1997, and by providing additional funds when required for special initiatives such as Australia Television International and ABC Pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us compare this with the opposition's threat before the last election to slash the corporation's budget by $50 million a year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry cast a very wide net; but, as the report says, the central issue was commercialisation. This was not an inquiry in which the ABC's critics hid their lights under bushels. Robust allegations were made. I believe the committee did examine them thoroughly. The picture that emerged was of an ABC that is sound and is providing a diverse and vibrant service. But it is clear that commercial influences have compromised the ABC's editorial integrity at the margins, particularly in the area of co-production. That problem has already been tackled by the board and by management. The committee believes that further changes to the ABC's editorial policies are warranted, along with a regular audit of external funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also foreshadows the possible need for greater public funding of the ABC's pay television operation to keep the commercial wolves at bay. In my view, that is a critical recommendation. Underfunding of pay TV has forced the ABC to accept equity from Fairfax and from Cox Communications, at a time when the future ownership of Fairfax is in considerable doubt. I believe this recommendation is not enough by itself. I have proposed further measures to maintain the ABC's relevance and integrity in the cable era. That is the era that is coming up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC should be guaranteed lanes on the FOXTEL and Optus Vision cable networks, subject to a fair price being negotiated. It is essential that any editorial leverage which the cable providers might have over the ABC's service be removed before it gets there. The fact that FOXTEL and Optus Vision will be `closed access' networks until at least 1997 gives them potential editorial influence which dwarfs anything that we have seen so far on free-to-air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC's pay service is extremely important&mdash;in fact, more important than is generally understood. But inadequate funding has exposed it to commercial pressures it could well do without. I have great faith in Kim Williams upholding the ABC's integrity, but I would be far happier if the potential for compromise was eliminated right now, or at least substantially reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the report strongly endorses the ABC's Asian TV service&mdash;Australian Television International. I am even more pleased that it accepts that increased core funding may be needed to ensure that ATV builds on its impressive success to date. I would go further and remove sponsorship from ATV altogether, but I am pleased that the committee has endorsed a measure which would at least reduce the commercial pressures on that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the committee did find problems, the question then arises as to who should take responsibility. As we know, the ABC chairman yesterday announced that the director of television had accepted responsibility and had resigned from that position. This has happened just three months short of Mr Conroy's retirement. It would be most unfair if the manner of his departure were to obscure his contribution to a very productive period in the ABC's history. Of the hundreds and hundreds of co-productions under his leadership, problems were discovered in only a handful, and serious breaches were discovered in, at the most, three. There is room for concern that some complacency had crept into editorial content of co-productions, but I do not believe that responsibility rests solely with Paddy Conroy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 10 years, the ABC has come under unprecedented pressure to become more commercial and to stretch its limited budget further. I think it is important that we remind ourselves that greed was good in the 1980s, and the ethos of public broadcasting was widely regarded in this place to be old-fashioned and out of date. It is very easy for us to go tut-tut and to wag our fingers at the ABC for allowing commercial influence to creep into programming decisions, but the fact is that, until very recently, the two major parties were strong advocates of that trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at the some of the things they said. When Michael Duffy was communications minister he urged the ABC `to make greater use of commercial opportunities in the marketplace'. John Howard said that commercial sponsorship on the ABC was inevitable and that people who rejected it would be sticking their heads in the sand. The pressure on the ABC reached the point where the chairman, Bob Somervaille, issued a press release expressing concern at the policies of the major parties in the lead-up to the 1990 election. He criticised Labor for failing to commit itself to a further funding agreement and for refusing to rule out corporate sponsorship. He criticised the coalition for threatening funding cuts and advocating sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in that context that the ABC cut its work force by about 1,000 and started looking aggressively for external sources of income. It is now clear that the pendulum swung too far, but that is with the benefit of hindsight. The two major parties showed no concern about that until it became impossible to ignore. My main criticism of the report is that Labor and the coalition did not acknowledge that their policies were wrong too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be hearing strong criticisms again from the Labor members of the committee about the process by which this report was produced. I will make a couple of observations on that issue. It is normal for the chairman to produce a draft report for the committee's consideration. Senator Alston did that, and we strongly disagreed with the draft. Negotiations began as usual. That is what happens. The report was changed to better reflect the views of the committee. Senator Alston willingly engaged in a constructive process and I believe that produced a good report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr and Senator Forshaw decided that they could not support the initial draft&mdash;that is understandable, I could not either. But there is much in the final version that I believe they could agree with. They have refused to consider giving any support to the majority findings. They are more intent on exposing what they see as flaws in the committee system. I find that a matter for regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something which occurred this morning, however, is much more than a matter for regret. In fact, it is an outrage that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has given great prominence to an alleged finding by this committee that a member of the ABC management acted&mdash;and I use the term it used&mdash;dishonestly in the reasons he gave to Ms Pamela Bornhorst for putting her on probation. The committee did not draw that conclusion as Senator Alston has said. That word does not appear in this report. It is a matter of deep distress that yet again a person's reputation has been falsely maligned by the actions of someone in this place with a particular view of this matter. It is equally distressing that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> chose to publish that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of this exercise is that a contempt of the Senate may have been committed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> may have left itself open to legal challenge and this controversy has been reignited on false grounds&mdash;a proud moment indeed for somebody! The Democrats believe that this matter must be investigated by the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the treatment of Ms Bornhorst's dismissal in the report is balanced. The committee was unable to find evidence of any political interference in the decision to dismiss her. It found that there were real problems with her relations with her colleagues, but that the problems had been poorly handled by management over many years. Whatever might be said about Mr Chubb's actions, he did at least take actions where others had feared to tread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there are some lessons for the committee system. Firstly, the chairman in the first draft should really strive to reflect the majority view. Secondly, all parties should do as much as possible to negotiate an agreed outcome. Thirdly, and most importantly, all parties should set aside politics and draw conclusions which are consistent with the available evidence rather than bending the facts to fit a predetermined stance and running a political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the media to concentrate more on the findings of this report than on the long-running personality feud between two members of this committee. It is old news, it is tired news and we have heard it before. The real news is that both major parties have recognised that adequate public funding is the key to public broadcasting. At last we have an acknowledgment that you cannot keep hacking away at the ABC's resources without paying an unacceptable price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by thanking the members of the committee secretariat for their excellent work. They were caught in the crossfire. They were asked to do far more than was reasonable. They did it with great ability and with great good humour and they deserve a glass of champagne and a good rest. I will be pleased to help them out with the first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I love the ABC dearly&mdash;it is my ABC. I listen to ABC radio and I watch ABC television. I believe the ABC is now far more relevant to Australia and to all Australians than it was ten years ago. I look forward to continuing my rewarding relationship with the ABC for a very long time to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no doubt that from the outset this was a politically motivated inquiry. The original terms of reference were a hotchpotch of biased conclusions cobbled together in search of supporting arguments, and the amended terms of reference were no better. That is clearly illustrated by paragraph 1(b) of the terms of reference, which referred to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">controversial proposals to abolish regional Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV News, advocated with great vigour by ABC Management and rejected by the ABC Board&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That term of reference was totally incorrect. It was without any foundation whatsoever. Yet before and during the inquiry the management and board of the ABC were attacked for even daring to consider proposals regarding its news and current affairs broadcasts on television. This false term of reference was put to rest only when it was outlined clearly to the committee that management had never advocated the abolition of ABC regional news, but had put a proposal to the board which would have extended the amount of coverage of ABC news on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the proposal was rejected by the board. ABC retained its 7 p.m. news based upon regional and national news, followed by its current affairs report at 7.30. This is a clear example of the board doing its job. It considered proposals brought to it by management and made a decision on those proposals. That term of reference is a clear illustration of the entire process in this report and the reason why government senators on the committee could not, in the end, agree with the majority. From the very outset, the inquiry was loaded to focus on negative, pessimistic views about the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the board's action on that occasion and its actions since in respect of the Palmer report&mdash;which was commissioned by the board to look at the issue of co-productions&mdash;demonstrate that the board is doing its job. It does not need a Senate committee of inquiry to go on witch-hunts and fishing expeditions to enable it to do its job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention one other episode referred briefly to by Senator Bourne&mdash;that is, the Bornhorst affair. The committee spent 1 1/2 days out of seven inquiring into the position of a single employee who ultimately left the ABC. As Senator Carr so rightly pointed out, in the process a range of people were very maliciously slandered on the public record. We on the government side believe that those people&mdash;particularly Janine Walker&mdash;deserve an apology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, the majority report suggests that the proposals on news broadcasts demonstrated some centralisation in Sydney. This committee held hearings only in Sydney and Canberra, except when it went to Brisbane to deal with the Bornhorst affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining time available to me&mdash;and I no doubt will have further opportunity to address the report&mdash;I want to say that I support everything that Senator Bourne said about the ABC in her concluding remarks. The public love the ABC. That is clear by the recognition that is given to the broad range of ABC services that are provided and its audience reach. It produces first-class drama. Australian content on ABC television is significantly in advance of what it was 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a first-class, internationally renowned ABC news and current affairs service regarded as one of the best in the world. The ABC is a leader in children's programming. It has created a dynamic youth broadcasting network through Triple J. The ABC has excellent educational and open learning services. It is a leader in developing Australian comedy, and, of course, it continues its great role in promoting and developing culture and the arts through the orchestras and other programs on ABC television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a creative organisation of over 5,500 employees who do a great job for one of the great public broadcasters in the world and, I might say, one of the few public broadcasters in the world that rely almost entirely on budgeted funding, unlike other national public broadcasters that do accept advertising overseas or, like the BBC, have a licence fee system to sustain them. Whilst we acknowledge that the ABC will have its faults&mdash;in any creative organisation of this size that is to be expected&mdash;we believe that these mistakes when they do occur, and some have occurred as George Palmer QC found, will be appropriately dealt with by the board and by the management. We have seen that evidence in the last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reject the negative, pessimistic tone of the majority report that suggests that the ABC should not look to the future, should not look necessarily to being involved in things like pay TV or ATV because of a fear it might get it wrong. We want an ABC that is dynamic, that moves with the changes in technology and continues to be, as I said, one of the great broadcasters in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, as the public has shown through its great support of ABC open days, it is the public's ABC&mdash;and I note the report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our ABC</EMPHASIS>. It is not the Senate's and it is not the preserve of a few journalists who want to continually criticise it and look at negative aspects; it is the public's, who I believe support very strongly the ABC. Aunty is doing a great job and I think it is about time we, in the parliament, recognised the great job it is doing. We should give it the support that it needs to continue that job rather than look for opportunities and ways to attack it and bring it down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, and hopefully I will have another opportunity to make some further remarks, I thank the secretariat staff. They did a stirling job under what were clearly trying circumstances, particularly in this last week with the time constraints upon them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By arrangement with Senator Woodley, I have drafted some amendments which have been circulated and I want to explain them briefly. The first amendment seeks to substitute the reporting date from the date mentioned in Senator Woodley's motion to 28 September 1995. The reason is that the committee which this is being referred to has two fairly large references before it already. The committee chair tells me it would be impossible to do it by the May date, and it will even be difficult to do it by the later date. The committee is a very expert one and very well chaired by Senator Ferguson, but it is going to have difficulty because of the work it already has. So that is the reason for that one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the second amendment to, paragraph (1)(d), is that we do not see that there is any real need to mention `instead of expanding the consumption of coal generated electricity'. The paragraph asks the committee to look at alternative sources of power, and we have added to that `including hydro power' just to make sure that all those aspects of power generation in Queensland should be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment seeks to delete the original paragraph (2) and substitute the one that I have circulated. It is principally a rewording of it to make the motion read better. Although the original motion did ask the committee to look over all relevant state and federal government reports into electricity and the 1992 report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, we have reworded that so that it makes sense and also to confine the committee more or less to looking just at the 1992 report, to see whether the Eastlink proposal, as it is currently proposed by the Queensland Electricity Commission and Pacific Power, does take into account the reservations that have been raised by that previous Senate committee report. So with those amendments the coalition supports the reference to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of concern in the area between Queensland and New South Wales about the Eastlink proposal from a health and an environmental point of view. There is general recognition that the national grid is good for Australia, but there is concern about whether it is good and will mean cheaper power for Queensland. So for those reasons the coalition thinks it is well worth while the committee looking at that and addressing the very considerable concerns that have been raised by people in that area. I am sure my colleague Senator Boswell, perhaps amongst others, will elaborate on that. Therefore, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Paragraph (1), omit "11 May 1995", substitute "28 September 1995";</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have at least one of the issues here that Senator Cook was responding to. It is something that Senator Watson had raised. It was: can the project be completed in its three-year time frame? That is the issue I am to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax law improvement project team believes that, within three years, it will have broken the back of the task and shown very clearly the community benefits to be won from this project. With such a vast amount of law to review and with the public consultation and parliamentary process necessary to complete the task, it may well be that a little longer is needed before all the ends are tied up. But having such a schedule will help to maintain a momentum and allow the benefits to be delivered to the public as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some other matters too. Senator Watson, I understand, has claimed that, on page 55 of the bill, there is the highlighting of a major problem in the underlying policy. It contains an example which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you fly to Los Angeles for the sole purpose of attending a seven day conference, but you don't record the conference in your travel record, you cannot deduct the cost of the airfare. This is so even if you have written evidence that you paid the fare (eg a receipt), as required by Division 5.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point Senator Watson made. We do not see this as a major problem. Just because a person has a receipt for a trip does not mean that they have engaged in business activities for some or all of the time that they were away. They could have attended a conference for one day and then spent several weeks on holiday. A record of their business activities while away on a long trip is required to establish a connection between their income earning activities and the expense. All they have to do is make a written record of their business activities while away. This is a very easy requirement, especially given the high costs which can be involved in long overseas trips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue that has been raised is the urgency of the bill and why it should be passed as soon as possible. The bill eases the substantiation rules in numerous ways which benefit taxpayers. These benefits are so great it was decided that the bill should be backdated to 1 July 1994 to enable taxpayers to take advantage of these benefits as soon as possible. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>, which outlines taxpayers' rights and responsibilities, is about to go to the printers. If the bill is not passed soon, it  will not be possible for these new laws to be put into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> and into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this bill is not passed now, taxpayers will have deductions denied on the basis of rules which are unnecessary, out of step with commercial reality and so complicated in some areas that we suspect that no-one fully complies with them. For example, under this bill taxpayers can claim up to $150 for laundry expenses without receipts. Under the current law, taxpayers will be denied such claims unless they have receipts for their electricity, water and power costs and carefully calculated costs of how much each wash costs them. That does seem a bit ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill taxpayers can use the cents per kilometre method even if they travel more than 5,000 business kilometres. Under the current law they cannot. Under this bill taxpayers do not have to sign logbooks and diary entries. Under the current law they will be denied claims if they do not sign such entries. Under this bill taxpayers can annotate receipts which do not adequately describe what they have purchased and can rely on an invoice plus a bank statement to support a declaration. Under the current law you cannot do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are only a handful of the benefits for taxpayers contained in this bill. These changes have been widely welcomed. No taxpayer will be disadvantaged by the backdating of the bill. If the bill is not passed now, taxpayers will have rules applied to them which they know will not apply in the future. Taxpayers will be totally confused as to what they must do to substantiate their deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson raised his concern about a situation where someone goes to a show, pays $10 to go through the gate&mdash;it must be one of the shows we have been going to recently, Senator Watson&mdash;and then must pass the ticket in so that there is no record of expenditure. Section 5(7) of schedule 2B allows taxpayers to use a diary entry or similar record if the Commissioner considers it unreasonable to expect them to have gotten written evidence in any other way. So all those shows we are going to, Senator Watson, I presume are in your diary and mine. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. The expense may be more than $10 and there is no monetary limit on the amount which can be substantiated in this way. Other examples of this type of situation include tollway fees and parking metre expenses. I think Senator Watson was also concerned about uncertainty as to whether the Commissioner will exercise this discretion. I am informed that the Commissioner will be happy to issue a tax ruling or tax determination on the situation that Senator Watson is concerned about and in relation to other similar circumstances which may be raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees had a concern. She argued this bill does not benefit ordinary taxpayers. All of the benefits in this bill apply to ordinary wage and salary earners. Some of the examples that I have referred to would clearly illustrate that. Seven out of ten taxpayers are affected by the substantiation rules and will benefit from the easing of the rules by this bill. For example, some $3.5 million taxpayers claim deductions for protective clothing or deductible uniforms. Almost all of them will benefit from the changes, which will enable them to claim up to $150 of laundry expenses without substantiation. Sixteen per cent of salary and wage earners, more than one million people, claim deductions for car expenses and will benefit from the greater access to the cents per kilometre method and the much simpler logbook rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as well I am here for this one. I understand that Senator Harradine raised a question with respect to my comments during a debate where I was alleged to have misled the Senate.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again on advice, I did not mislead the Senate. That act contained measures relating to children's income provisions of the income tax law. Comments on these provisions were made by several people. Some comments directed only to non-government senators were made on the expected evening of the Senate debate because the debate was a few days earlier. Senators sought comment from the government on these various comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government provided written notes on each of the matters raised. It also provided copies of the explanatory material from the introduction of the child income provisions, division 6AA, Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The original intention of the parliament was stated clearly in those notes and in that material, as were the government's views on the amendments it proposed. I stated to the Senate the government's view on particular aspects of the amendments. Senator Harradine challenged that. Reasons for the government's views were set out in the material that the government gave to interested senators and different views were set out in various materials also received by interested senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) was passed, Dr Dwyer and Ms Dwyer raised a further argument against the government's view that new subsection 102AG(2)(a) was a restatement of the existing law. This new argument was not raised in the written material on which senators sought a response from the government before or during the debate. Dr Dwyer and Ms Dwyer published their views in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Butterworths Weekly Tax Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 10 January 1995. They claimed that the Senate had been misled. Mr Hood, a senior tax counsel of the Australian Tax Office, replied in the same issue of the tax bulletin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council has now raised the question of whether or not the Senate was misled, relying on the views of the Dwyers. The government does not agree with the views expressed by Dr Dwyer and Ms Dwyer. I was correct to express the government's view and did not mislead the Senate in doing so. I was responding to clear statements by Senator Harradine of a different view, and both of us gave reasons for our views. Those different views form part of the material the Senate considered in deciding to pass the bill. Further arguments for and against one of these views do not make statements made to the Senate misleading and they were not intended to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine raised concerns over the operation of the rule in Sanders v. Vortore. I understand that after the debate Senator Harradine accepted advice and those concerns were allayed. Dr Dwyer and Ms Dwyer seem to have accepted the same advice in their views published in Butterworths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not seek to mislead the Senate when these concerns were genuinely held. The fact that those concerns were misplaced does not mean the Senate was misled, and nor were they intended to. I did not mislead the Senate as to the government's view of the formal law. The government still holds the view that I expressed. It is true that some aspects of the view are disputed. That dispute was a matter of record in the Senate debate. The government and certainly I did not mislead the Senate by stating our views any more than Senator Harradine would mislead the Senate by stating his own view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek clarification of the term `expense' used in the new substantiation provisions. I wish to have an assurance that the plain English substantiation provision does not override section 51 in the sense of a matter maybe having to be paid as opposed to being incurred. I remind the Senate of section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That is the general provision in relation to an expense being incurred. These substantiation provisions could affect a doctor who brings income to account on a cash or accrual basis. For example, if the doctor gets a phone bill on 29 June, under section 51 he would be able to claim the expense for the phone bill because the expense was incurred in respect of phone calls up to, say, 3 June. He received the bill on 29 June and, according to section 51 of the act, he would be entitled to a deduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words there are quite specific. I refer to the general provisions of section 51. All section 51 really states is that an expense has to be incurred. The inference I gain on reading the substantiation provisions is that it must be paid. If that is the case, this really introduces a new dimension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether we really need a definition with the way it is written in plain English. This is one of the problems we are incurring because we are changing to a plain English style. Is it intended under this plain English version that the amount must actually have been paid before 30 June or can we still rely on the older provisions not yet written in plain English which provide that the expense has to be incurred? Using this new format is essentially going to deny quite substantially the availability of deductions for many professional people who come within the ambit of section 51. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make sure that these new substantiation provisions are not going to change the law. We have been assured that there are no changes, but by virtue of the plain English style and the emphasis on meaning, it appears to me that there could well be a change. If the judges, for example, believe the law is clear, then the assurances we get in the second reading speeches or during the committee stage are to no avail. I think we should at least ask the question because it is most important that in the way this is written&mdash;I go along with the plain English version of using examples because examples do help to explain the law&mdash;there has not been a change in terms of what is required under section 51 of the act. We are supposed to be bringing about a greater element of certainty. I want to make sure that in what I say now and in terms of later presentations I will make, particularly in relation to section 5, we do have a position that is absolutely certain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also use this opportunity to respond to the parliamentary secretary's summing up of the second reading speeches. I thank him very much for the assurance he has given that in terms of section 5(7) of the act there will be some examples by way of adding to the list I have given as typical of where a number of people could run into trouble. I think parliamentarians are very much in this category. Their expenditure patterns are such that an allowance is given for certain activities or expenses incurred in connection with their parliamentary business for which it is very difficult to get receipts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a major problem with the $200 limit. I wanted it increased. The parliamentary secretary has agreed with the compromise of issuing a ruling. The problem with rulings is that they can be withdrawn without the assent of the parliament. While it is a second-best option, I appreciate the parliamentary secretary's assent to issuing a concept of a ruling to clarify 5(7). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether the ruling can be linked into section 5(7). In order to trigger section 5(7), you actually must be subject to an audit, which means that taxpayers who are over the $200 limit and have genuinely expended such moneys&mdash;they can prove it by virtue of their travel itineraries or their diaries or whatever it is, but actually do not have a ticket from the show society or the ethnic organisation or the Red Cross or whoever it might be&mdash;may run into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to trigger that, a taxpayer must be subject to an audit. How many taxpayers are going to subject themselves to fighting the commissioner having to rely on a discretion on a particular ruling'? Basically, it will be forcing these taxpayers to go to their tax agents, who will charge them $100 or $200, to get a deduction of $100. That scenario is not on. So who wins? Most taxpayers will not test the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third point is that the parliamentary secretary did not respond to another issue raised by the Taxation Institute. It is concerned that the process will inhibit the response of ordinary taxpayers, such as blue collar workers, who are really frightened of being called before tax auditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary was not present during my speech on the second reading; in fact, one of his colleagues was handling the matter. I draw the parliamentary secretary's attention to a fundamental issue that we have to address very early in this whole tax law improvement program. The Tax Institute acknowledges that a `move to a simpler legislative framework with a less legalistic structure is clearly a preferable approach to the future direction of the tax laws'. I agree. However, the changing language used in the legislation is not of itself sufficient to materially reduce the compliance burdens on taxpayers in complying with the substantiated provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I welcome the concept of a tax ruling as it applies to section 5(7), somehow I would like that tax ruling to be related to section 5(6), if possible. In order to get to section 5(7), the process itself is convoluted because the onus is on the individual to prove on audit. Until people get audited, they are effectively sitting on the edge of their seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that our colleague Senator Margetts will shortly be introducing an amendment to substantially change the compliance rules. I will restrict my comments to that point. I might take this opportunity, in addressing the title and the matters raised in the second reading debate, to refer to section 82A of the act. </PARA>

It has been a matter of some considerable debate between the tax office and members of the tax liaison group. There have been concerns at that level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is really a question of how wide an application you are going to give to your proposed ruling. I am very happy about the concept of the ruling&mdash;as the second best option. However, I would have preferred the clarification in the legislation. Since the government wants the legislation quickly, the coalition is trying to accommodate that request by not pressing amendments. This is the first piece of legislation that has come through the good offices of the tax law improvement team. It covers a very narrow field of work-related expenses. I ask why the existing provision, section 82A, covering self-education expenses. As I understand it, section 82A concerns work-related expenses. Therefore, the inconsistency is that not all work-related expenses have been included in this substantiation legislation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that an undertaking was given in April 1994, in a meeting of the occupational rulings committee with the various accounting bodies, that this issue would be addressed in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 82A, if an individual taxpayer incurs self-education expenses, he is not entitled to deduct the first $250.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, under the Fringe Benefits Tax Act, self-education or education to benefit an employee are exempt from its provisions. The first question is: why was that assurance of the meeting between the occupational rulings committee and the accounting bodies broken or not proceeded with? The second question is: as this was the first attempt to cover work-related expenses, why was the very important item of self-education omitted, in terms of denying a taxpayer the entitlement to deduct the first $250?  Why was the undertaking not honoured? The third question is: isn't it reasonable that taxpayers' should be allowed the whole amount, just as the company or the employer is entitled to a deduction as from the first dollar spent? This is especially so in view of the fact that, for fringe benefit tax purposes, we do not regard self-education as a fringe benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated, I am pleased to get the minister's clarification; however, I am disappointed that the government has not proceeded with a form of speech in the form that it was. I will state for the record that there were comments in the draft speech that were obviously prepared for the minister that I would certainly want to have incorporated in the record. Whilst there are a number of comments in that draft speech that referred to most of the issues that related, there were two paragraphs which read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These additional amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill No. 3 (PIELAB) meet concerns that the RAS may not be implemented in full consultation with the States. They put in place a requirement for all Commonwealth RAS assistance to be the subject of Commonwealth/State Agreements, including regional initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments retain provision for, subject to Commonwealth/State agreement, payments to be made directly to beneficiaries, for payments to entities other than farmers under all elements of RAS and for flexible cost sharing arrangements under all elements of RAS. However, as has been stated before, the assistance would be provided within the framework of a Commonwealth/State agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst I am certainly reading from a draft that was made available to us yesterday, it must be reiterated that they were the important issues that we certainly wanted to see reinforced and which the presented government amendments address. We were intending to propose amendments ourselves which would have met those very requirements, but I understand that, by negotiation between Mr Anderson's office and Senator Collins's office, those issues were comprehensively picked up in the 12 amendments that have now been placed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's original decision to send this bill to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee resulted from the lack of information about how RAS regional plans would work, how they would be funded and whether they would be constitutionally acceptable. These concerns have been borne out by the committee's report, which was also tabled in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee recommended the bill be passed without amendments, it recorded at that time its concerns that the explanatory memorandum and, in particular, the second reading speech did not contain detailed information on the proposed amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. Even the Attorney-General's Department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administrative arrangements to be undertaken by the Commonwealth in relation to the new non-state-based component of the RAS are not clear from the available material. It is this lack of information which appears to be of concern to the Parliamentary Research Service. In the absence of that information, it is not possible to form a view whether the proposed administrative arrangements would be valid.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee concluded that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the minister must provide information that will allow the parliament to make informed judgments when considering legislation. During the inquiry, representatives from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy said that refunding for RAS regional plans would come from `the underspends' of each state. The coalition is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Malcolm Smith, from the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria, said that the federal government wanted to impose a levy on states on top of the underspends which would create a larger pot of money. Mr Smith correctly pointed out that the Victorian government would not be happy to provide finance for a regional restructuring plan in Queensland. Quite rightly, any state that puts money into a scheme must receive the benefit for its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is aware that the regional restructuring area in Queensland appears to be welcomed by the people of that area because it was sought by the local people. It is a grassroots request. It is not a decision made at the top being imposed on the locals. For this reason the coalition is pleased that the government is now proposing amendments in line with the Senate committee's dissenting report which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a minimum, the legislation should be amended to require the Commonwealth to consult with the States on regional adjustment initiatives, fully recognising that the States have the responsibility for land management.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's amendments ensure that a regional restructuring program cannot go ahead without agreement of the particular state or territory. We would also like an assurance from the minister that any regional reconstruction scheme will be as a result of initiatives of the local community and will not be foisted on the community from a federal Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that Senator Crane and Senator Brownhill will address this issue and ask for additional information, as both participated in the Senate inquiry in this area. We are concerned that in parts of New South Wales the government is trying desperately to have its restructuring plans look like they are the idea of the locals when in fact it is being forced upon them. The coalition has no objection to the government amendments put forward. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 were initially considered by the Senate on 9 February 1995 as part of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill No.3 (PIELAB). The proposed amendments were referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering the proposed amendments, the Committee generally supported a regional approach to the RAS, but raised a number of concerns, in particular:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the constitutional validity of the amendments;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">administrative arrangements to be established to implement the regional approach to the RAS; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consultation with the States in developing the regional approach to the RAS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report in its deliberations made a number of useful observations on the proposed amendments. The further amendments now proposed respond positively to the Committee's report and accommodate the Committee's substantive concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department has provided clear advice that the proposed amendments are constitutionally valid and that this validity is not affected by any administrative arrangements that may be put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's ability to enter into agreements with persons other than states; and to make direct or indirect payments to farmers and persons other than farmers, for the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">purposes of rural adjustment; is supported by the appropriations power in s81 and the incidental power in s51(xxxix) of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a regional context, the Commonwealth funding is intended to be provided for community based activities relating to rural adjustment. The activities would be driven and undertaken by the States, local government, community and industry, with the Commonwealth in addition to a funding role, monitoring the expenditure of such funding ensuring that it is spent for the purpose for which it was allocated. A role which Attorney-General's Department advises is within the Commonwealth's constitutional powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the Committee's concerns as to the lack of clarity on administrative arrangements, on 3 March the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) endorsed in principle the implementation of integrated and community based regional approaches involving the linked implementation of rural programs such as the RAS, National Landcare, Agribusiness programs, and Rural Communities Access Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ARMCANZ also agreed in principle to the early implementation of a Rural Partnership Program (RPP) based on a model incorporating input from the Case Studies Report undertaken by SCARM which focussed on South West Queensland and Sunraysia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The framework supported by ARMCANZ involves a competitive bidding process, extensive community consultation, and joint development of regional strategies with the States and the community. The suggested approach is consistent with that developed by the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council (RASAC), and discussed between Commonwealth and State RAS Officers in May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The South West Queensland Regional Strategy is a pilot project for the development of a regional approach to rural adjustment. The strategy is generally consistent with the ARMCANZ approach, incorporating an integrated package of adjustment measures, including RAS, Landcare, and Rural Counselling. The strategy was initially proposed by community based organisations which recognised the need for rural adjustment within the SWQ region, and is a real partnership between the community and governments at local, state, and Commonwealth levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has always been my intention that within the broad framework discussed with the States, the detailed administrative arrangements under a regional approach would be developed in consultation with the States on a case by case basis and with their full cooperation and consultation. A successful regional initiative can only be effectively and most efficiently implemented with the full cooperation of all parties, Commonwealth, State and local governments community and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The states were consulted on the proposed approach to a regional component to the RAS including on the nature of each of the proposed amendments to the Act, at a meeting of State/Commonwealth RAS Officers in May 1994. The States have been consulted in detail on these additional amendments and support the approach proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These additional amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill No.3 (PIELAB) meet concerns that the RAS may not be implemented in full consultation with the states. They put in place a requirement for all Commonwealth RAS assistance to be the subject of Commonwealth/State Agreements, including regional initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments retain provision for, subject to Commonwealth/State agreement, payments to be made directly to beneficiaries, for payments to entities other than farmers under all elements of RAS and for flexible cost sharing arrangements under all elements of RAS. However, as has been stated before, the assistance would be provided within the framework of a Commonwealth/State agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability to make direct payments and payments to organisations and groups will allow greater efficiency and effectiveness in program delivery. It will allow for example, one cheque to be paid directly to a training course facilitator, rather than multiple cheques being paid to individual farmers that attend. It will also allow closer linkages to other programs with direct payment elements such as Rural Counselling, Landcare, and Agribusiness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flexible cost sharing arrangements allow provision for states or the Commonwealth to make greater funding contributions to regional projects should they so wish. This flexibility is essential to permit RAS assistance to be tailored to regional and community needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the amendments to honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to make some comments with regard to this legislation, particularly the amendments that have been brought before us, which satisfy the concerns that we had. I am talking about the initial concerns that Senator Brownhill and I and others raised in this chamber when the original legislation was here and then what came through in the committee and in the dissenting report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point that I want to make causes me enormous concern. One must ask the question how we got legislation brought into this place when it does not reflect the minister's second reading speech. I believe that somebody needs to answer the question as to where the legislation came from. Was it the fault of the department or was it the fault of the minister? It is very serious when legislation which is at such divergence from the second reading speech is brought into this place. It was not a little mistake; it was a huge mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech related to regional agreements. This legislation should facilitate those agreements, whereas  under examination&mdash;getting the information was like drawing teeth&mdash;we find that the legislation would have given the Commonwealth power to override every aspect of rural adjustment as we know it. The flow-on from that, relative to the management of land title and aspects of that, is quite enormous and horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that legislation was brought in there was certainly a move to change the face of land management and rural agriculture in pastoral Australia as we know it. It is something that I was very upset about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the speeches following the second reading speech a number of us raised these particular issues and put down a series of questions for which we wanted answers. Yet, when the committee met to discuss this particular legislation, the department did not come up with a statement or responses to any of those questions. I am very critical of the department for that. It is not its normal form, in my experience. Once again, I pose the question why, in this case, having raised all these issues in this place, the questions were not addressed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, it meant that the committee's work and the time we spent there was extended significantly. At the end of the day we got the information out, even though, as I said, it was like drawing teeth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I pay tribute to the work of Neil Bessell, the secretary of the committee.

When we look at all the aspects of it, at the end of the day we got those particular aspects drawn out. The important amendment amongst these&mdash;all the amendments are important&mdash;relates to 20AA(1) and 20AA(2), concerning the memorandum of understanding about section 20A powers, where it says:</PARA></TALK.START>

That amendment is absolutely crucial, if this concept of regional schemes is going to work. I support the concept, but it has to be done under the proper guidelines. It has to be driven from the ground upwards and it has to have the full cooperation of the states. Otherwise, it will just turn into a messy conflict. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling and Senator Crane have laid down pretty well the thinking of senators on this side of the chamber in respect of this legislation. What we now have before us really shows the benefit of referring such matter to a committee. It does not matter what government is in power, legislation that comes to this place needs to be subject to good scrutiny. I think the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee did a pretty good job in actually finding where some of this legislation was flawed. This is not the first time that primary industry legislation in this place has been flawed. I guess that, given the number of pieces of legislation that actually come to this chamber, it is not unexpected that there will be things that slip through. Maybe sometimes the department or the minister try and get through an ambit claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right from the start, as Senator Crane has said, we were concerned that there was going to be an overriding of the present act. People should realise what the current RAS act does. Under the arrangements set out in the 1992 act, the Commonwealth provides financial assistance to the states and territories. Payments are made to states by way of grants in accordance with the RAS agreement between the relevant parties, and under the agreement the Commonwealth defines the purpose and objectives of the scheme and specifies the outcomes expected. It does this by way of directives and guidelines to the states. It actually set the parameters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all very well. What worried and concerned me in the first instance about this legislation was that it looked as though there would be an imposition by the Commonwealth, from above, saying, `We want to regionalise this particular area.' That is not the way the parameters were set for south-western Queensland. In that area the parameters were set from the grassroots up and the Commonwealth came in in conjunction with the state. It is now not just a matter of the word of the minister. Senator Crane pointed out the difference between the legislation and what was contained in the second reading speech. The amendments provide that there is actually going to be consultation between the states and the Commonwealth before this is enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the constitutional basis for the proposed amendments.

The law or proposed law must have a constitutional basis. There are about five pages.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest concerns with this legislation was that there has not even been any consultation with the state ministers. Senator Tambling has read some of the letters that came back from the states to say that they were very concerned. It is very important that they should have been consulted in the first instance. If we end up having an adjustment of a regional area being imposed from on top rather than coming from the regional area concerned and then through the state government, we are going to face a lot of problems in the future. I thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, for actually coming up with these amendments in conjunction with Mr Anderson, the shadow minister, to make sure that the legislation is not flawed either constitutionally or in its effectiveness. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Constitutional Basis for Proposed Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a Commonwealth law to be valid it must come within at least one of the Commonwealth powers enumerated in, or capable of being implied from, the Australian Constitution. The law or proposed law must have a constitutional basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only rarely will a Bills Digest call into question the constitutional validity of a piece of legislation or a particular aspect of a Bill. In most cases it will be simply unnecessary to do so. In the present instance however, the proposed amendments which allow for direct payments from the Commonwealth to individuals raise a number of interesting constitutional issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The Legislative Process</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the normal course of preparing legislation, the initiating Department or agency will, where any doubt exists, seek advice from the Attorney-General's Department as to the constitutional validity of the proposals being developed. That advice is neither binding nor definitive but is invariably well considered and the product of many years of accumulated wisdom within the Attorney-General's Department. In many cases, proposals are recast to take account of Attorney-General's advice and consequently questions of constitutional validity are mostly answered before legislation is introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, the Attorney-General's Department's advice may or may not be clear cut. Moreover, it is for the sponsoring Department to determine whether it wishes to proceed with its legislative package to final consideration by the Legislative Committee of Cabinet before bringing the legislation into the Parliament. Bills sometimes "fall over" because the Government collectively determines that the risk of provoking a successful High Court challenge is too great, but there are also occasions where the Government either deliberately seeks to test the limits of its constitutional powers or else the policy imperative "driving" the legislation cannot be resisted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation may be introduced without reference to the Constitutional head(s) of power relied on. Legislation may, but need not, recite the relevant sources of Commonwealth power, nor are those sponsoring legislation required to advise the Parliament&mdash;through the Explanatory Memorandum or the Second Reading Speech&mdash;as to constitutional basis of the measures proposed. Given the opportunity, it is of course quite appropriate for Members and Senators to test those responsible for the legislation on the issue of validity, particularly where the relevant legal basis has not been volunteered. Indeed, what follows are no more than the arguments for raising just these sort of questions in the context of the current proposals affecting RAS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Constitutional Limitations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not uncommon for the Commonwealth to involve itself in activities which are not on their face Commonwealth areas of responsibility under the Constitution. This can be achieved by a variety of means, through:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.an existing head of constitutional power being given a broad meaning by the High Court;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the use of broad "purposive" powers which do not relate to any particular activity but whose subject matter is determined by the object to be achieved [eg. the purposes of "constitutional corporations"&mdash;see section 51, placitum (xx)];</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.a combination of taxation and grants powers;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.reliance on a range of ancillary powers including the incidental power [section 51, placitum (xxxix)] and the executive power (section 61) and implied powers derived from the Constitution and Australia's status as a national polity;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the referral of power from the States to the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.co-operative arrangements between the States and the Commonwealth; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.reliance on technically invalid legislation which is yet to be ruled to be unconstitutional by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hence, the Commonwealth is involved in the promotion and regulation of a whole range of activities, for example: sport, education, research and business ventures which are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution but which are commonly accepted as legitimate areas of Commonwealth interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As has already been noted, however, there are limits to Commonwealth power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The limits to the Commonwealth's activities are determined by the High Court on a case by case basis. However, as each case is decided on different facts (and not infrequently by different judges), it is not possible to know precisely or be able safely to predict the limits of the Commonwealth's powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a controversial matter has not been litigated, where the Court is divided, or where the relevant decisions of the Court do not lay down general principles, there will remain some residual doubts as to the validity of legislative provisions which do not fall squarely within the established meaning of an enumerated head of legislative power. Reliance on an implied or inherent power is by definition problematic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Validity of Amendments to RAS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some doubts exist as to the constitutional underpinnings of the amendments being proposed to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 (RAS Act). This is not because there is any inherent objection to the Commonwealth involving itself in the process of rural adjustment, but because the method chosen here to deliver that assistance may not be within the Commonwealth's power. (At the risk of oversimplifying, the question of constitutional validity frequently turns not on what is to be done, but on how it is to be done.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is not specifically empowered to make laws with respect to rural adjustment. Any scheme which provides for Commonwealth involvement in rural adjustment must therefore rely on some other power or powers. So for example, the Commonwealth can (and has) enacted legislation which, through grants to the States, supports a range of measures to assist rural reconstruction as well as other forms of assistance to primary industry. Other strategies such as those involving taxation concessions would also be valid by virtue of being laws with respect to taxation which is an explicit area of Commonwealth legislative competence [eg. section 51, placitum (ii)].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contrast, there is some doubt as to whether, and the means by which, the Commonwealth may provide direct financial assistance to individuals. In some areas there is no uncertainty because the Constitution clearly provides that the Commonwealth may provide direct assistance. For example, section 51 (xxiiiA) allows for the Commonwealth to make payments in the form of maternity allowances, widow's pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits etc. However, as already noted, no such power exists in relation to rural adjustment or payments for drought relief. Likewise, for the most part, the Commonwealth's use of the appropriation power (sections 81 and 83) is uncontroversial. Most Commonwealth appropriations are for programs which have a clear constitutional authority. For example, the Jobsearch and Newstart allowances are clearly authorised by a combination of sections 81, 83 and 51, placitum (xxiiiA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Commonwealth payments to individuals, specifically those for purposes or activities not enumerated in the Constitution, have been a source of legal controversy and have been tested in the High Court. Moreover, despite those cases it would be somewhat adventurous to suggest that those controversies have been safely put to rest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential sources of constitutional difficulty for direct grants are twofold. Firstly, the grant itself may be invalid. This will be the case where the funds expended have not been validly appropriated. Secondly, the scheme devised to administer the grant may also be beyond power&mdash;legislation establishing a scheme may be outside the power of Parliament to enact laws (principally section 51) or an administratively based scheme may be beyond the scope of the executive power of the Commonwealth (section 61).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key elements of the proposed non-State component of the RAS would appear to be:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.appropriations to be made by the Parliament (sections 81 and 83 of the Constitution)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.legislation designed to facilitate the payment of direct grants to individuals [potentially supported by the incidental power&mdash;section 51, placitum (xxxix)]</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.an as yet not fully disclosed set of administrative arrangements for distributing the funds appropriated by the Parliament under the executive power (section 61).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of the proposed non State-based component of RAS, each of these aspects of the scheme must be within power for the scheme to be constitutionally valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Appropriations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear that the non State-based component of RAS is to be funded by an appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund either as a separate measure or through the annual Appropriation Bills. The relevant constitutional provisions here are sections 81 and 83.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 83 of the Constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 81 of the Constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the most part, the Commonwealth's use of the appropriations power is uncontroversial. Most Commonwealth appropriations are for programs which have a clear constitutional authority. Commonly, there are two pieces of legislation, an Appropriations Act, and an Act like the Social Security Act 1991 which regulates the program. Two Acts are required because an appropriation of itself is only a financial measure. In the words of Mason J in Victoria v. Commonwealth (AAP Case) the act of appropriating funds:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not supply legal authority for the Commonwealth's engagement in the activities in connection with which the monies are to be spent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now generally accepted that an appropriation may be made for any purpose and need not be confined to purposes or activities assigned to the Commonwealth under the Constitution. This view was accepted by three of the five judges who addressed this issue in the AAP Case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AAP Case concerned the constitutional validity of executive action taken in support of an appropriation. The Australian Assistance Plan was a scheme established by executive action within the Department of Social Security, and supported by an appropriation. Under the plan, regional councils for social development were to be established at a non-governmental level throughout Australia to identify local social welfare projects which could be supported by a Commonwealth grant. Victoria sought a declaration that the appropriation was invalid and an injunction to restrain the Commonwealth from spending any of the money for purposes of the plan. The Court dismissed the action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although this decision did not settle the scope of the appropriation power, the better view would appear to be that appropriations can be made for any purpose&mdash;not just matters by reference to heads of legislative power identified under the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those interested, the different approaches taken by the High Court in the AAP Case on the scope of section 81 have been summarised by Zines as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.The appropriation power is a power to appropriate for any purpose. The executive power enables the Commonwealth to carry out that purpose (McTiernan and Murphy J) and section 51 (xxxix) provides a legislative source of power: Murphy J.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2."Purposes of the Commonwealth" in section 81 refer to legislative and executive purposes to be ascertained by examining the specific powers of the Commonwealth and its inherent power as a nation: Barwick CJ and Gibbs J.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Section 81 permits appropriations for any purpose but does not permit the Commonwealth to engage in activities unless those activities come within section 61. The scope of section 61 is to be ascertained as in (2) above: Mason J.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, there would appear to be little doubt that the Commonwealth can draw funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to provide assistance under the proposed amendments to RAS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Legislative Power</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the extent that legislation is employed to underpin the operations of a scheme of the sort proposed under this Bill, that legislation must come within a head of legislative power enumerated in the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amongst the heads of legislative power commonly relied on is the incidental power [section 51, placitum (xxxix)] which provides that the Parliament may legislate with respect to any matter that is incidental to the execution of a power (including the executive power and the appropriations power) by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the RAS Act proposed in the current Bill appear to come within the scope of the incidental power in that they relate directly to the creation of administrative machinery designed to provide grants to persons under the non State-based component of the RAS Act. The Commonwealth's proposed purpose in appropriating any funds under the present proposal may also provide a basis for the use of the incidental power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) Executive Power</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 61 of the Constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practical effect of section 61 is to enable the government administration to undertake many administrative activities without prior authorisation from an Act of Parliament. This view is supported by the AAP Case and Davis v. The Commonwealth. McMillan provides a number of examples of executive actions undertaken without the support of legislation, including:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, however, considerable doubt as to whether the executive power can be relied on where a Commonwealth proposal does not come within a substantive head of legislative power. Put another way, the executive power is confined to areas of Commonwealth legislative competence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both the AAP Case and Davis, members of the High Court (including the present Chief Justice) took the view that executive action which was unsupported by a head of legislative power and intruded into an area of State responsibility was invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of whether the executive action "intrudes" into the activities of a State will be one of degree, partly dependent on the nature of the administrative arrangements developed to facilitate and monitor the expenditure of funds appropriated. A complex scheme involving, for example, the creation of a separate Commonwealth Agency is more likely to "intrude" than a system of simply making out cheques according to a list of names compiled by a Department or in the Minister's office. As McMillan has noted:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At one extreme, the Parliament can simply authorise payment of a cheque. For example, to establish an AAP-type scheme the Parliament could make a number of individual grants to organisations to run family day care, parent education, and the like. Alternatively, the Parliament could make a block grant to a private organisation like the Consumers' Health Forum, to be distributed by it to individual projects like family day care.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In either instance the Parliament could then pass allied legislation to ensure the financial accountability of the organisations (for example, providing that each recipient of Commonwealth funds had to acquit to the Commonwealth, and had to use the money for the purpose specified in the grant). The constitutional basis for such legislation would be a s51(39), which provides that the Parliament may legislate with respect to any matter that is incidental to the execution of a power (namely, the appropriations power) by the Parliament. Informal influence could also be exerted by the appointment of a Commonwealth representative to the committee of a private body&mdash;an executive action that could be justified as safeguarding legitimate Commonwealth interests in health, welfare, and financial accountability.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even so, the administrative activity could not develop to the point (as it did in the AAP Case) that the executive was effectively engaging in the activities that were not Commonwealth responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The position is further complicated where there is a valid appropriation and the Commonwealth seeks to rely on a combination of the executive power and the incidental power to put into effect a scheme which is not directly related to a substantive head of constitutional power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g) Concluding Comments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This digest has discussed at length the Constitutional limitations on the power of the Commonwealth to pay money directly to individuals. This discussion was prompted by concerns raised with the authors over the validity of the amendments proposed to the RAS Act.</PARA>

Instead of arriving at the farm gate, it could go to facilitators or, in this instance, to TAFE colleges. This gives me some concern because I believe that the rural adjustment scheme is one that has been of great benefit to Australian farmers. Any watering down of this process and any diminishing of the funds of that process concerns me. They could go into all sorts of airy-fairy things, or TAFE colleges or more formal education. That in itself is not a bad thing, but those rural adjustment funds are desperately needed out there at the moment. The funds need to go to the farm gate to supply the needs of the farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is now investing rural adjustment funds and it is setting up a totally new structure. It will be negotiating different agreements with different types of groups. Each group is going to have to learn how the relationship works and what is expected of them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995 amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to the following budget initiatives: $8.7 million to be provided in 1995 to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling and $4 million to be allocated in 1995 to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing program which supports eight languages in each state and territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also give effect to changes to the Commonwealth's new schools policy. Whilst the opposition will not be opposing this bill, we do continue to express concern at the new schools policy of the government and the timetable for the review of this program as recently announced by the minister. To understand many of this bill's implications fully, it is important to have a background understanding of what these measures involve. With regard to the new schools policy, in order to gain provisional approval and, eventually, final approval for general recurrent funding, schools must meet certain eligibility criteria, including an advanced notification requirement and a sufficiently high funding priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the 1992 act, a school wishing to operate at a new location, amalgamate, provide an additional level of education or separate into two or more schools must give notice two years before 1 March in the year in which the change is proposed. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 extends this notice period to three years before 31 October for changes proposed on or after 1 January 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 23 of this bill introduces a further notification requirement for changes or proposals intended to occur on or after 1 January 1998. So that notification of a change or proposal to be funded in 1998 will be required by 31 October 1995. We are already a quarter of the way into 1995 and, not only has this bill not been passed, but one must question the ability of schools which have not acted pending the outcome of this bill to give adequate notification by the end of October this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition maintains its policy position of the last election, which is to abandon the new schools policy. The Labor Party has always been philosophically opposed to non-government school education. This policy is just one example of this outdated philosophical position. The principal objective of this policy is to make it as difficult as possible for new schools to start. The policy is opposed to real parental choice in schooling, with the post-1992 funding policy effectively pricing non-government schools out of the reach of many parents. The coalition is committed to parental choice in schooling and we believe that this should be an affordable choice. The coalition has long been opposed to the new schools policy. The policy is restrictive, intrusive and designed to restrict true parental choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representatives of non-government schools have repeatedly said to us that the policy significantly retards new schools growth. The ironic aspect of this whole debate is that the government has now virtually conceded that there are problems being caused by this new schools policy. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, announced early this month that a review of the policy would be undertaken. It is quite obvious that this review is no more than an attempt to placate growing anger in the community about the program. That fact is obvious from the timetable for the review which allows for a discussion paper by the middle of this year, but a finalisation of the review itself by March 1996, probably after the next election. We would urge the government to bring about a finalisation of that review by the end of September this year at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns we have with this bill have been shown to be legitimate to the extent that even the minister acknowledges the new schools policy, which this bill serves to further restrict, needs further review. Had the government the courage to listen to the opposition in the first place and to abandon this obnoxious policy, the sector would not be in the chaos it is in today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have been told by Senator Gibson, the legislation we have before us, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1995, provides $8.7 million for a literacy program concentrating on the early years of schooling and provides additional money for a language program as budget initiatives which have taken until this time to manifest themselves. We also have some non-controversial changes to administrative arrangements under the new schools policy. The Democrats will be supporting and welcoming all of these aspects of the legislation, but that is not to say that there is no controversy to be explored. With Senator Gibson, I believe there are many parts of the new schools policy which can and should be challenged; but perhaps not at this moment, because in this legislation what is being proposed is worth while.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gibson said that the policy of the coalition was to abandon the new schools policy. I wonder whether that means that there will be no policy with regard to new schools from the coalition or whether we can wait in anticipation, as we do with many other coalition policies, for the vacuum to be filled. I will welcome the day when we see some substance there. With regard to the other aspects of the legislation, I take this opportunity to make comment on the provision for education both by the Commonwealth and indirectly by the states, as they are the recipients of money from the Commonwealth to sustain their education systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important for me to state here and now that the 1990s will be remembered as the decade when Australia's economists looked into their crystal balls and decided that the future was far too expensive. While it is trite to say that our future is in our schools, it is becoming even more true as we move to the year 2000 and to a world where those with skills prosper while those without skills struggle even to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this challenge, and in response to the need to position Australia in this new world order where knowledge and education are the sources of wealth, in aiming to achieve their vision of a clever country the leaders we have at the moment and have had over the last few years have overseen the systematic starvation of our school systems. Australia now ranks 13th out of the 16 countries in the OECD in education spending as a percentage of GDP. We are on the way down with a bullet, despite more of our population being of school age than is true of most other developed countries. We remain ahead only of such notable international economic powerhouses as Turkey and Portugal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1970s we spent nearly six per cent of our GDP on education, and now it is down to only about 4 1/2 per cent. In 1980, 25 per cent of government spending nationwide went on education, and now it is down close to 20 per cent. In Victoria we have witnessed the Kennett government slashing more than $300 million off the education budget, closing 250 schools and sacking thousands of teachers. South Australia has followed that short-sighted lead, as has Tasmania, where the Liberal government has cut education spending for three years in a row by a cumulative 20 per cent. We also see that Mr Goss got rid of 450 teaching positions in 1994. New South Wales faces a shortfall of 2,500 teachers, and New South Wales has the largest class sizes in Australia. It begs the question: when did investing in the future become such an unpopular idea?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these cuts have occurred through a period of rising enrolment and rising retention rates, and at a time when the demands of the new information age have meant that more resources are needed to teach children to cope with the technologies of the future. What should be spent on education is being contradicted by what is being spent. I do not want to get into the pointless argument that often goes on in this place about whether it is the responsibility of federal or state governments. The state governments have been cutting spending on schools partly because the general purpose grants to states have been cut by a third by this government, but it is also partly due to their own lack of commitment to public education. I do not want to get into a debate on the pros and cons of the new schools policy. I think there is much in that to explore, but not at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The popular response to the sorts of criticisms that I have just made has been that throwing money at a problem is not the way to solve it. I agree with that; it is not the whole solution. But it is quite foolish to suggest that better qualified teachers, smaller class sizes and better equipped schools can be achieved without money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's own reports&mdash;and I start with the Finn review, the Ramsey report and the Swan report&mdash;all called for substantial increases in school funding. They all commented on overcrowded classes, inappropriate facilities, outdated equipment and limited access to technology. But instead of heeding those reports, the Commonwealth has introduced this bizarre concept of benchmarking. As I said in a committee the other day, `benchmarking' to me is a gerund. It has been used as a verb by a whole new race of bureaucrats who seem to think that it is more important to invent a whole new vocabulary than to get on and actually address the basic problem that not enough money is being spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, this benchmarking business is based on cost, so all states are now competing to spend the least amount of money per student in order to be assessed as the most efficient. Arguments are expressed in terms of achieving cost reductions, and the usual thing that is quoted is `without sacrificing educational standards'. In fact, what is happening is that we are being pushed towards the lowest common denominator in an inexorable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the effects of the considered neglect that is going on in our schools are obvious. We all know of state schools in poorer areas with composite classes. The debate about that is not the debate that we need to have here, but it is a fact that there are more composite classes in schools in poorer areas. In those same areas we have incomplete equipment inventories and facilities. We see a reduction in the numbers of science teachers, and we see teachers doubling up in areas in which they have no training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some courses are not offered or schools rely on voluntary fundraising to pay the salaries of the so-called `extras' of music, language or physical education teachers. We know that retention rates are falling, that literacy rates are low and that surveys show people are losing confidence in the government school system. I believe that relates directly to the sorts of things that Senator Gibson was raising. It is alarming to see this process under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are more insidious effects that are not as obvious. We can see a school system which is beginning to entrench inequality&mdash;entrenching a permanent underclass. We are seeing a school system that is being privatised by stealth and by neglect with all the implications for inequality that entails. Because we have so-called voluntary fees, we have the `McDonaldisation' of our education system&mdash;we have untrammelled and unregulated corporate sponsorship. We see attempts to keep a check on this process but those attempts are failing because our schools are needing to compete for resources by attracting more students. The aspects of this phenomenon will manifest themselves more clearly as time passes, but I would ask honourable senators to take note of what is happening when they see the sponsorship logos on the gates of our schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they are strapped for cash, the schools all around our country demand extra fees from parents. In South Australia, as I brought to the Senate's attention in a notice of motion just a couple of days ago, if parents do not pay these so-called voluntary fees, the school takes them to the small claims court or it sends around a debt collector to remind the parents of the obligations that they have to the school of several hundred dollars. I do not think that is a funny matter at all, Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other states we have seen children refused their school report cards. We have seen access to library books denied to students who have not paid these so-called voluntary fees. This has also happened in respect of lockers, excursions, school camps, annual school bike rides, or whatever, welding equipment, trade and craft materials. Inferior or no materials are provided to students whose parents have been unable to pay these so-called voluntary fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This insidious trend has gone well past the point where, when you and I were at school, Minister, such a concept was probably $3 or $4, perhaps even $30 or its equivalent in today's terms. Now we see $300 and $400 being the common level of voluntary fees per student per school. In some state systems where education maintenance allowance cheques are provided, we have even seen principals refusing to hand those over until the so-called voluntary fees have been paid. </PARA>

In fact, these fees are no longer for just extras, if ever they were. They are being used to fund basic items such as books, materials, gymnasium equipment, and so on. The president of the Victorian Association of Secondary School Principals has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schools cannot provide adequate quality education without the voluntary fee.</PARA>
<PARA>If the minister is concerned about these matters, perhaps he might take that quote with him and see whether that in fact means a voluntary fee or whether some sort of pressure is being placed on parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ACT primary schools, parent contributions almost equal the government funding of operating budgets. They are used to funding programs offered by schools and the essential equipment for those schools. I think this is simply unfair. Schools in affluent areas can raise money and sustain their programs and schools in poor areas cannot. The difference in school funding can end up being tens of thousands of dollars. Of course, it is immediately apparent that these fees are regressive in the extreme, and that a single income family with four children in high school is looking at having to pay several thousand dollars; $1,400 a year is not unusual in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I re-state the position of the Democrats that this is the sort of thing that we ought to be very concerned about. We as a party believe that the only fair education system is a free education system. We oppose these fees that I have been speaking about, in any form, and we oppose this idea of introduction by stealth of a user-pays system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schools in some states are now funded on the basis of student numbers so that the money they do have to spend on features attractive to success conscious parents are to the detriment of student welfare programs. I have heard reports&mdash;I must say that they are informal reports and I cannot verify them at the moment&mdash;of parents with children who have behaviour problems approaching schools and being told, `Don't turn up, go somewhere else. Go and pester some other school.' Brian Burdekin has called the public education system's treatment of young people with social disabilities as `an abomination'. That is a quote of his attitude to that. These are the sorts of insidious trends that are a direct result of the way we fund our education system at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Smith Family survey showed that our school system is now so inequitable that 60 per cent of children from poorer families are leaving school functionally illiterate. This package of legislation makes some attempt to address that. However, I suggest that that attempt&mdash;the spending of $4 million for the priority language program and $8.7 million for an early years literacy program&mdash;could easily be seen as wasting money unless the other problems in our education system are addressed. Those problems are the problems that are inherent in the way that we have allowed these insidious voluntary fees to creep up to the extent where they increase inequities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia cannot afford to have an underclass of people that has been denied any position in the world where knowledge and skills are the things that are most important. If we neglect those people to that extent, then we should be condemned. When fees are not immediately extractable from parents, the other place that our school principals go to for money is to the corporate sponsors: McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Hungry Jacks, Mars Bars and Coco Pops. Schools are being funded by the amount of lolly wrappers the children can pick up from the gutter&mdash;I am not stretching that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen fundraising schemes which involve dollars being returned to a school based on the amount of grocery receipts or lolly wrappers that are collected by the school. Every senator in this place should be familiar with these trends and should be awake to what they mean in the end. If the school needs computers, it must negotiate with IBM or Apple, which have the whip hand over this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those companies are determining what ends up being provided for learners in our schools, not the departments of education. That happens in the fortunate instances and not at the end where kids are picking lolly wrappers out of the gutters. We should be deciding what equipment goes into our schools.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht did interject and did seem to have a misleading view of certain aspects of public and private education in this country. Speaking today for the Democrats, Senator Bell has made much of the fact of private sponsorships in schools and the lack of funding for public education. Let us look across a whole range of areas. I have just come from a press conference with his colleague Senator Bourne. She indicated that the problems of the ABC could be fixed with more money. Senator Bell has indicated that the problems of education could be fixed with more money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look around Australia at the run-down infrastructure; we could certainly fix the roads with more money. Farmers are crying out for drought relief. What do they need? They need more money. The harsh reality in this country, of course, is&mdash;and I think today's current account deficit blow-out of almost $3 billion has borne this out&mdash;that the days are long gone in this country when we could afford to do everything that was needed: we could build the roads that were needed; we could provide the welfare benefits that were needed; we could provide the funding for schooling that was needed. We have got to look around for some creative solutions to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schools are being forced into a range of measures to get hold of extra funding because of lack of funding in the public budget. But there is quite a simple answer to the whole problem in education of lack of funding which this government has overlooked. That is, providing true freedom of choice for parents in schooling in this country. We have a situation where parents pay $1.5 billion at the moment in private school fees. This takes tremendous pressure off the public budget for education. If the government wants to continue taking pressure off, obviously what it can do if parents want to do this&mdash;and it is a democracy; we live in a society with freedom of choice&mdash;is allow parents to send their children to private schools if they are prepared to pay the fees. My children go to private schools; I am prepared to pay the fees. There are a lot of others out there that are prepared to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government calls its policy the new schools policy; I prefer to call it the no new schools policy because that policy is there to put a brake on the expansion of private schools in this country. I was chairman of a private school while it was expanding; I felt and the school felt the full effects of this policy. Even though we were established in a suburb that was not expanding, the enrolments of the school were drawn from right across the whole region. We were drawing enrolments from expanding areas. Under this policy, the regional situation is not taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we had some hearings here in Canberra. We heard from the Steiner school people and they are having exactly the same problem. Because they want to locate a school in an area that does not have rapid growth, they are being prevented from doing this. The government still does not recognise the regional nature of the school system. I think one of the most telling indictments of the government's new schools policy and its approach to private schooling in this country is that the people from the Steiner school movement told us that if they were establishing their entire system in Canberra at this point in time under the government's so-called new schools policy, nothing would start. It would stymie them; the system would not even start. This so-called new schools policy would break it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the point I am making very simply is that, if the government is concerned about lack of budget funding for schooling in this country, there is one solution that will not cost the budget anything at all. If people want to set up schools, if they meet the minimum requirements of the school educational authorities, they should be allowed to go ahead and do it. What this would do is allow a gradual expansion of the private school system. We are not going to end up with 70 per cent private schools in this country. That is not going to happen at all. But I would think that it would possibly go up from where it is now&mdash;27 per cent perhaps&mdash;to something like 35 per cent. If we multiply the dollars that would save the government across the country&mdash;as it is now saving $1.5 billion&mdash;that could be sufficient to assist public education. That saved budget money could be put back into public education and could allay some of the concerns that Senator Bell has raised. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes some amendments to the new schools policy to improve the processes for non government schools to receive government funding. It also clarifies the complicated process of gaining approval for progressively introduced education levels and replaces the Priority Language Incentive Element with funding for 10 priority languages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Greens will be voting for this bill as we believe the bill's measures will improve the workability and administration of the New Schools Policy. This does not mean we do not have criticisms of the New Schools Policy, but we do believe these reforms will enhance the workability of the policy pending its review over the next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the community have raised their concerns with me about the utter complexity of the New Schools Policy. They question the limits of minimum and maximum numbers of students allowed before a school can open and claim government funding. This places undue inflexibility on new schools who will have fluctuating numbers in their first years. This can actually have a destabilising effect on new schools, whereas the purpose of the policy is to help viable schools get off the ground. The Government's definition of viability is narrow of course&mdash;being too caught up with economic viability rather than educational viability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other big concern is with differing rules for independent schools versus systems. Schools are forming systems&mdash;bodies that run schools, in order to circumvent the very complicated rules that benefit systems. This means that identical schools in different areas can get very different levels of funds which is unfair and inequitable. Schools then get locked into the category of funding they have received in the past although they may be changing their focus, expertise, populations and demographics, but they cannot change their funding to match their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further community concern expressed to me is on the new priority languages program stipulated in this bill. The Government will give priority to 10 languages. It is assumed that this is a realistic goal to introduce 10 different languages into the school curriculum. However, I understand that it will be very difficult to retrain teachers and change the focus of language teachers so quickly with limited resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are just some of the larger concerns we have in the context of this Bill. We are however supporting this bill because it reintroduces some rather complicated amendments to make the New Schools Policy which requires a lot of rethinking, to work in the interim, before we get something better.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 September 1994, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the federal government's drought assistance package, which included tax incentives for farm storage and water facilities to encourage farmers to better prepare for drought. At that time, he also indicated that other, longer-term measures would be taken to cabinet at a later date to deal with such matters as taxation initiatives and income equalisation deposits. These additional measures were announced in December of last year. The package included an enhanced farm management bonds scheme, with additional tax incentive measures to encourage the building up of physical reserves for future drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In broad terms, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995 amends, firstly, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to provide for a drought investment allowance to encourage investment in drought mitigation property; and, secondly, the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Act 1976 to make farm management bonds a more attractive investment vehicle for farmers. The coalition will be supporting this bill. However, there are a number of points that need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the fact that the government announced these measures in December last year and forecast the drought investment allowance in September last year. It is, therefore, an indictment of the government and the minister that it has taken so long to prepare the legislation. It also needs to be stressed that the government has only now accepted the fact that long overdue drought preparedness measures should be available for the current financial year. The opposition and farming industry leaders have been arguing this point for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the bill itself, the drought investment allowance will benefit only those farmers who can afford to purchase capital equipment. In addition, the condition that use of water storage and transport facilities must be in accord with an approved water conservation plan is, in effect, forcing farmers to enter into such plans. Secondly, the changes to the farm management bonds scheme will benefit only those farmers who are lucky enough to have earned enough income to set aside as a future insurance against future droughts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) to confirm to the Senate that the definition of `item' in proposed new section 626 of this bill is sufficient to cover a combination of several elements&mdash;for example, a water management plan consisting of three small storage dams, reticulation between them and a bore. Can these separate but interrelated elements be aggregated into one item and be eligible for the drought reduction allowance, even if the cost of individual items is under the $3,000 limit but the total cost exceeds $3,000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition have some concerns about this point, and have sought advice from the Taxation Office.

The stewardship grant made to farmers in the East Gascoyne region of Western Australia was some $25,000 towards landcare and that sort of thing, but one of the things that is mandatory about it is that the owner must live on the station. I suppose that is a fair enough assumption in certain circumstances, but I know one station owner who is 75 years old. He still holds the station. He is battling to get up into a truck or into any sort of heavy vehicle, but to get the grant he has got to be able to live on the place. I suppose he might be able to do that, but he has had a manager&mdash;the same manager&mdash;for 20 years. That manager has a wife and children.

All of those sorts of things those farmers may be able to do, but those who are drought affected will not get one cent out of this bill. Why will they not get any help? Because this bill allows deductibility from taxable income; and, of course, drought affected farmers have no income, so to them the deductibility is of no use whatsoever. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The economy in 1995 is a very different kettle of fish from that in 1986&mdash;and Senator Alston knows that perfectly well&mdash;in terms of the growth rates we have been achieving, the inflation rates remarkably low that we have been sustaining, the levels of investment remarkably high that we have been seeing and the associated productivity, the competitiveness gains and the exports that are associated with that and the general shape of the economy. The current account deficit remains a problem, but it is a problem that should be seen in context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit fell by $111 million in February from the previous month, due to a strong rise in exports and a fall in the net income deficit. The deficit of $2.165 billion was in fact right down the lower end of market expectations, which ranged on this occasion as high as $2.7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But more important than the size of the deficit is its composition and the circumstances that have led to its change, including the surge in imports of capital equipment, which is of course part of the general surge in productive investment associated with a very strong economy. Investments are now forecast to grow by an extraordinarily strong 24 per cent in 1994-95. Remember, we said in the last budget it was going to be 14, and those opposite were sort of chortling their heads off at that stage on the ground that that was unobtainable. This of course is sucking in imports of capital equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capital imports rose 24 per cent in the first eight months of 1994-95 compared with the same period in 1993-94. These imports reflect that the prospects for growth&mdash;not just the present growth rate, but its prospects&mdash;are excellent, and that of course reflects the economic success of which I spoke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unsynchronised nature of world recovery has meant that Australian demand for imports has picked up ahead of world demand for Australian exports. While the US economy has also experienced very strong growth, Germany has thus far experienced only a weak, largely export-led recovery, and Japan is only just emerging from recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been structural change in the economy, such as the fact that as a result of tariff reform Australia is in a transition phase on the path to greater export diversity, with the initial impact of raising import intensity. Falling world commodity prices have seen Australia's terms of trade decline over the last several decades, making it increasingly hard to balance our trade without structural reform on the export side.There is the drought, which is adversely affecting rural exports still. Although rural exports rose two per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in February,  this followed falls of four per cent in January and 11 per cent in December. There is the two per cent rise in world interest rates, which adds to debt servicing costs and the net income deficit. These are all factors affecting the balance as it is presently emerging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the $2.4 billion current account deficit in December and the $2.3 billion in January are the highest monthly deficits on record in absolute terms, they are clearly not the highest&mdash;and we seem to be past that hump already if the figure for this month is going to be sustained&mdash;as a proportion of GDP. Monthly deficits of close to this amount were recorded in January 1990 and December 1989, when nominal GDP was significantly lower. That again creates part of the context against which these figures should be seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk in terms of increases against GDP, but that is not so; they have been in that sort of territory before. The important thing to appreciate in all of this is that the long-term prognosis is good. Manufactured exports continue to respond well to the improved economic environment and as these other international factors of which I spoke a moment ago come back into the kinds of parameters that we are anticipating, they will have their own positive effects, too. The crucial thing is this underlying increase in Australian competitiveness, now nearly 40 per cent since the early 1980s, low inflation, low wage rises, strong productivity growth and maintaining that. We have seen exports particularly strong in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures, growing by 16 per cent last year and by 19 per cent over the year to date. These are all signs of an economy that is flourishing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the comments by the Victorian Premier and other reports in the media regarding Defence's decision to award a contract for supplying Italian forklift trucks to the army. The adverse comments that surfaced yesterday follow an unfortunate trend by losing tenderers to question the Defence processes and cry foul. I can assure the Senate that the Defence tendering processes are rigorous and are carried out with the utmost propriety. They have to be because we are dealing with very large sums of money across a diverse range of equipment and facilities in defence. It must be, however, said that the defence processes do sit in rather stark contrast to the rather quaint tendering processes that occur in the state of Victoria these days. But I might give an airing to those matters at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make some specific comments about the forklift truck project and the assertions made. The tender for this project involved three companies, namely, Domino Mining, Caterpillar Australia and Tutts. The first two contenders offered an overseas product with a through life support for the equipment, essentially locally based. The Tutts product is an Australian made forklift with some imported components, mainly the engine and transmission. With equipment such as this, army undertakes a comprehensive test program to examine the capabilities of each machine. It should be appreciated that this forklift is required to operate in the field under a variety of conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Tutts forklift, it was found that its large size made operations in confined spaces very difficult, the high boom severely restricted the vision of the operator&mdash;a significant safety factor&mdash;preparation for transport by air was far less easy than the other two competitors, and the machine did not have a separate inching and creeping function, as required in the specifications. In addition, in comparison to the preferred tenderer, the operator had to stop the machine to change gear on gradients, the wheels were so large that they required two people to change them, and the boom cylinder mounting brackets were underdesigned. I am also informed that the claim made by Tutts that it was the only machine to have passed all the trials is incorrect. In fact, all machines incurred some damage or partial failure during the trials.</PARA>

To do so would really, I think, pervert the whole tender process. I have no intention of importing to the Commonwealth tendering processes those that the current Victorian government is implementing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of those commitments I have described, the Prime Minister could not have got there at any earlier time. That arrival did not enable him to advise the ITB for reasons I will now once again put on the record. Before his visit to Germany, his office made inquiries about him attending the International Tourism Bourse on 8 March. That is one of the reasons why he was scheduled to get in there at that time. The other appointments were concluded to enable him to get there, despite the very busy program he had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice that was received from the Department of Tourism, the Tourist Commission and the Australian Consulate-General in Berlin was that he should not do so. They have confirmed that advice, completely repudiating Senator Parer's claims. The reason was as follows: the fair concluded at 6 o'clock on that day of 8 March&mdash;not, as you have claimed in your press release, the following day. It concluded at 6 o'clock on the day that he arrived at the airport at 2.45 p.m. Stands were being dismantled throughout the afternoon. The Australian Tourist Commission advised then, as again confirmed, that by 4 o'clock, which is the earliest possible time he could have got there, there were very few trade buyers still present at the show.

The report makes significant recommendations on how to make the standards setting arrangements in this country advantage Australian industry, not only domestically but also for our export effort. The importance of the report is simple: in order to maximise opportunities for international trade, Australia's standards and conformance infrastructure must be operating at world best practice levels and must be seen to be in order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's recommendations are aimed at improving Australian standards setting processes and maintaining the excellence of Australia's measurement and testing facilities. It also clarifies the role of a number of bodies responsible in this area. The major recommendations include, most importantly, giving Australia a national weights and measures system instead of the current state based systems. This is a very important change. Industry will have to deal not with six different standards across Australia but with one national standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of where we have a problem at the moment. We have waited five years for all the states to carry complementary legislation to the uniform trade measurement legislation. After five years three states still have not carried the complementary legislation. As a result, in some areas of industry our standards arrangements are not operating effectively. For example, there are 400 different water meter authorities in Australia. This means that in some areas people are looking to local government bodies to privatise water delivery, where you have to have a very accurate water meter. There is now no national standard set for water meters. This is a major issue for industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that there be a full management review of Standards Australia undertaken to recommend management arrangements which would improve the performance of the organisation. It recommended that there be confirmation of the National Association of Testing Authorities, NATA, as the sole provider of laboratory accreditation services recognised by government. The committee recommended that Standards Australia and NATA divest controlling interest in their commercial certification activities, including quality assurance, to allow them to concentrate on their core activities of standards writing and laboratory accreditation respectively. It recommended that the charter of the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand, JASANZ, be amended to remove accreditation of laboratory accreditation bodies from its activities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said to the Senate yesterday, and I cannot really add much more to what I have already told the Senate on this, we are in the unfortunate position of having got our hopes up, with significant falls of rain earlier this year, that there would be an easing off of the pressure to import grain to sustain&mdash;and I am sure Senator Macdonald would not disagree with this&mdash;what are vitally important primary industries in this country that have largely developed to the extent that they have over the past 10 years; that is, the intensive poultry industry, the pork industry and lot feeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give just one simple benchmark of how the face of Australian primary industry has changed dramatically. In the early 1980s there were around 100,000 cattle in Australia in feedlots; in a normal year there are now closer to 800,000 cattle in feedlots in Australia. What that means for policy makers and, I might add, the decision makers in the major peak industry groups in Australia&mdash;and they have acknowledged this&mdash;is that the effect of a drought and a decline in domestic grain supplies in Australia is now far more severe, irrespective of the nature of the weather, than it would ever have been before. I have made the point before, as Senator Macdonald knows, that that is why comparisons to earlier droughts in Australia are, to a large extent, meaningless because the structure of the industry has changed so dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, because of the deterioration currently in the weather situation, and I hope it changes on an hourly basis, Queensland farmers in many areas are now slipping back into the drought. A significant amount of summer sorghum crop has been lost already. As I said publicly on Channel 9 last weekend, if it does not rain within the next week to 10 days we can add significant further amounts of summer sorghum crops from Queensland on that list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of areas have now formally slipped back into drought, as Senator Brownhill would know, in New South Wales and the current New South Wales minister has made a statement about that today. The situation is also continuing to deteriorate in places such as Victoria, which is why I have asked the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee to expedite its review of the Victorian situation, and RASAC will be in Victoria doing that this weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question of managing the risk, Senator. I cannot rule in or out the measures that you have mentioned explicitly. I simply conclude by saying we have not done a thing in respect of this matter that has not been done without the closest consultation with all of the peak industry groups involved. I met a major delegation only yesterday from a lot feeders association in Australia to address the real concerns that its vital industry has with grain supplies. The matter will be handled carefully, I can assure you, Senator Macdonald, and no unacceptable risk will be engaged in in the importation, unfortunately, of further quantities of grain into Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we had a touch of style, glamour and class in parliament. Unfortunately, it did not occur in either the House of Representatives or the Senate, but rather in the Great Hall when the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia combined with the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia to put on a fashion parade showcasing the talent of Australian fashion designers and manufacturers in the clothing, textiles and footwear area. Both Tim Todhunter, the committee chairman, for the authority and Anna Booth, the union secretary, deserve the commendation of the Senate because of the fine work they have done in promoting the Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry. It highlighted the new forward looking culture that is now permeating the TCF industry&mdash;a culture assisted by the government's transitional arrangements under the TCF plan begun in the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that old perceptions die hard and many commentators in the past, and perhaps some of the general public, have held the perception&mdash;a negative one, as Senator Chris Evans has referred to&mdash;that the industry is not an industry that is competitive. But I have to say that huge progress has been made. The people in the industry deserve the acknowledgment of the Australian community about that. The exports of Australian textile, clothing and footwear products are now valued at $600 million per annum. The industry has set itself what I think is a realisable target&mdash;others may regard it as ambitious&mdash;of $2 billion worth of exports from this industry per annum by the end of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes it does have a role in further advancing the interests of the TCF industry and, as a consequence, we commissioned the future strategies review, which worked together with the industry to assess what policy initiatives are required to achieve the targets that the industry has set itself. The review is currently being considered by the government but, as anyone who was at the exhibition this morning would testify and be an eyewitness to, there is a high degree of skill, flair, quality and competence in this industry. Indeed, it is a vibrant and exciting industry and, importantly, it is a growing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly barrier resistance measures are not the industry's prime concern any longer. The industry is now concentrating on world markets&mdash;focusing on international best practice and on such issues as training, benchmarking and, importantly, innovation. Australia's industry has undergone massive restructuring to date to meet the challenges and it is now the second fastest growing manufacturing exporter in Australia&mdash;quite an achievement, I think. Australian industries are now establishing themselves as major suppliers of textiles and other intermediate goods to the rapidly growing clothing market of Asia, and they have also established themselves as suppliers of high quality finished apparel to the consumer markets of America and Europe. Whereas people in the past were quick to write off the industry, I think it has shown a remarkable recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay particular tribute to some of the names who exhibited their products today: Rip Curl, Balarinji, Coogi Morrissey and Edminston, Howe Leather, Textile Industries of Australia, Godfrey Hirst, Brintons, Pacific Brands, and so it goes. These are companies that are now world class, winning an excellent reputation for Australian quality and Australian price competitiveness overseas. It does demonstrate, given that this was jointly mounted by the union and the industry, that this industry is working together to secure a bigger market for Australia in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the first thing that needs to be said&mdash;it is not. The Labor Party, contrary to what Senator Troeth says, is absolutely up-front and clear to the women of Australia about what its policy is. It has a rule and a guarantee that after the year 2002 there will be 35 per cent of women at least preselected to winnable seats. So Senator Troeth may say what she likes, but the message is quite clear. As I understand it, polling shortly after that announcement showed that it was very well accepted by women of Australia. It is clear. I do not believe the conclusion that Senator Troeth draws is at all accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the Prime Minister's speech last night. Didn't the Prime Minister last night commit the government to imposing a superannuation tax of three per cent on workers? You have been denying all that. If that is the case, then how are the ordinary low income and middle income workers going to be protected? If one of the reasons for the imposition is that there will not be enough workers in the labour force paying tax to sustain a pension in later years, why discriminate against the working families who are nurturing those very taxpayers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not my understanding of what the Prime Minister said. We are in, as Senator Harradine knows, the immediate pre-budget period. In the immediate pre-budget period, as an observer of political life, people run gambits about what may or may not be in the budget. I will be an impartial observer for a minute and say that oppositions tend to try to rumourmonger and to scaremonger to attract superficial votes to their cause by frightening people about what budgets may contain. That is a comment on political life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a situation in which those features can be seen in the debate that has been growing around what the budget may or may not contain. Certainly what the government has said about the budget is that this will be a tough budget. We are going to apply ourselves to reducing the budget deficit and meet the targets of the Treasurer's fiscal consolidation program&mdash;that is, get the budget into surplus after two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, there are from time to time remarks made about particular measures. At this stage, nothing is ruled in and nothing is ruled out. So the best thing, the most sensible thing and, indeed, the fairest thing is to wait for budget night and to take up the criticisms, if you have any, of what is actually in the budget rather than jump at rumour, or innuendo or political interpretations of what may have been thought by someone to have been contained in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;and I am pleased for this&mdash;has given me a copy of the Prime Minister's speech from last evening. On page 16 I think the relevant paragraph occurs. Perhaps I should take this opportunity to read into the record of the Senate what he actually said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our policy commits us to increasing the overall level of Australian superannuation contributions to 9 per cent from employers and 3 per cent from employees by the year 2002/3.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Prime Minister has committed himself to this government's moving to enhance the superannuation entitlements of ordinary Australian workers. That is something that this government has stood up for during its period of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister last night said that we intend to see this program through; we intend to ensure that ordinary Australian workers are entitled to a decent level of superannuation cover; and because, left to the marketplace, that has not been able to be achieved, we will legislate for it. I might also say that this is in absolute contradistinction to the coalition's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy, at the last election, was to remove the legislative requirement for a superannuation guarantee charge and require that the market determine it. We know that, when the market last determined it, those who were weakest in the market, those without bargaining power and those unable to secure gains from their employers, had no superannuation at all. So the coalition's proposal was to reduce the entitlement for the most vulnerable, most defenceless people in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine and I are veterans of this debate not only inside this chamber but also outside of this chamber in our previous occupations as well. I say to Senator Harradine, with the greatest of respect, wait for budget night, but please recognise the landmark changes made to superannuation and the rights of ordinary Australian workers by this government in ensuring that legislation insists that they do have a superannuation entitlement.</PARA>

Undertakings of this nature are a matter for consideration and decision by the Telstra board. Consistent with the principles for GBE reporting established by this government, and Telstra's articles of association, Telstra has kept the government informed of its intentions.

In addition, the government has provided substantial incentives for private sector investment in research through, for example, the Factor (f) pharmaceutical program as well as through taxation incentives.

She has ignored several parts of the question. The figures given are quite misleading. A look at the total amount of money spent on health in South Australia, particularly on hospitals since 1983, and the percentage that the Commonwealth is contributing shows that it has declined. The states have made some very substantial cuts, particularly to the Flinders Medical Centre, where 20 per cent of its surgery has basically been cancelled for three years. When is the money due under the Medicare agreement? Forget about the reviews; we are talking about the money. When will the money be handed over to the states? When will the minister do something about the cost shifting? It is fine to say that she is running another review about it.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review of Medicare Funding</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of the figures that I have quoted above come out of the interim report by Commonwealth and State officials on the effects of the decline in private insurance coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This review will do some additional work and report to Health Ministers in June.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No conclusions have yet been reached about the need to provide additional funding&mdash;and the Medicare Agreement does not oblige the Commonwealth to provide more funds if a strong case cannot be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Issues under consideration are the level of States' own contributions to hospital funding (which have generally been declining), cost shifting from the States to the Commonwealth (which automatically increases the Commonwealth contributions), and the extent of the demand shift from the private to the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cost shifting</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Lees has asked when the Minister is going to do something about cost shifting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I pointed out in my response yesterday, Dr Lawrence has taken a number of steps to arrest cost shifting behaviour by the States. Her actions have taken account of the fact that costs are shifted, as Senator Lees has noted, not only to the Commonwealth but to the private insurance funds and to patients and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also add that DHSH is investigating the need for changes to current legislation to address the cost shifting issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Medicare Agreements have provision for penalties for States which engage in cost shifting&mdash;to any of the above parties. While it would be last resort, States have been warned that penalties may be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Lees also asked yesterday about the use of community based services to reduce the demand on the public hospital system. I can supply the following response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware of the potential to use non-inpatient care more effectively. It has therefore funded (and continues to fund) a range of programs over the years to encourage more effective discharge procedures, better links between hospitals and GPs, home-based palliative care, and post acute care (to name but a few).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also structural changes which can led to better outcomes in the use of community based care. The Commonwealth is investigating the use of funding mechanisms based on an "episode of care" which encompasses not only the in-hospital phase of care, but includes the preparation for admission and the recovery or post-discharge phases of care&mdash;much of which can be provided by community based carers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This concept is also being explored by COAG and could potentially lead to changes in program boundaries between the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA>

The issue still remains that Victoria is entitled to an increased Commonwealth contribution and the minister might indicate, having said that there is a review partly in progress, when that increased funding could be identified and paid.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> further information for Senator Lees regarding the drug and alcohol program in response to her question to me on 28 March 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees asked the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services and Health, Senator Crowley, the following questions without notice, on 28 March 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the minister's attention to the recent survey by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia. Minister, do you agree with the survey's findings that the Commonwealth collected $3.8 billion in taxes on alcohol and tobacco in 1993-94 but spent only $36.4 million on specific drug and alcohol programs and services? If so, what is the explanation for that gap, considering that drug and alcohol abuse costs the Australian community at least $20 million a year? Finally, while the states and territories spend somewhere between 2.9 per cent and 24 per cent of what they collect for such programs and services on those services and the Commonwealth only manages one per cent, is it not about time for a considerable increase in the Commonwealth's financial commitment to education, intervention, treatment, research and other drug and alcohol related programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister, but that surely leaves open this question: does she believe the Commonwealth has any responsibility to put at least some money back? I am certainly not talking about all of it; we are looking at a realistic level in the states of putting four or five per cent back into drug and alcohol related programs. If the Commonwealth is not going to do that, those people will frequently end up in our hospital system, which is the most expensive end of our health service, as a whole range of services will be missing. I ask the minister: does the Commonwealth not have some responsibility? Is not the very small amount of money put back&mdash;it is about $2 per head; compare that with the Northern Territory, which is putting back $55 per head of what it raises in drug and alcohol taxes&mdash;only a fraction of what is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley&mdash;The Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, has provided the following additional information in answer to the honourable Senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no reason to dispute the collection of $3.8 billion from an excise on alcohol and tobacco quoted in the report by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia (ADCA), nor do I doubt the levels of revenue from taxes and revenue per head figures at the State and Territory level provided in the report. I do, however, have concerns at the validity of making comparisons between the expenditures of the different governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory is shown for example as returning 24.3% of its alcohol and tobacco revenue to drug programs and services. However it should be noted the Northern Territory is the only State or Territory which has introduced a policy of hypothecating alcohol tax revenue to address the unique problems of alcohol use in that Territory. The other States and Territories all spend around 3-5% compared to the Commonwealth which is shown in the ADCA report as only expending 1%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a valid reason for this apparent anomaly. The States are responsible for the direct provision of drug treatment and rehabilitation programs whereas the Commonwealth is not involved in direct service provision in this area. It should be pointed out that the figure of $36.4 million relates specifically to the additional funds provided by the Commonwealth to the National Drug Strategy. It does not include health services, income support and law enforcement activities. Based on a 1988 survey, the estimated aggregate outlays related to drug issues in current dollars is $1.594 billion of which the Commonwealth contributes $716 million. The figures in the ADCA report are therefore not necessarily a true reflection of the total level of commitment either by the Commonwealth or the States in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether or not the Commonwealth should be returning a greater percentage of the revenue raised by taxes on alcohol and tobacco to specific programs addressing the harms caused by the misuse of all drugs both licit and illicit, the Government believes that the appropriate approach is generally for tax revenue to go to consolidated revenue for the spending from that revenue to be determined on the basis of relative priorities, rather than a formula linked to specific tax collections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Government is concerned with the level of drug and alcohol use in Australia. The National Drug Strategy is a co-operative effort between all governments (including health and law enforcement jurisdictions) and the non-government sector with the common aim to minimise the harmful effects of drugs.</PARA>

<PARA>This issue was raised this morning with Senator McMullan's office. It was flagged fairly early in the piece. I have an interest in fondly receiving an answer to this overdue question. I also put on notice that quite a large number of questions are outstanding in relation to the National Media Liaison Service. Regrettably, estimates committee questions on notice do not come under the 30-day rule. I give notice today that, unless we can see some speedy responses to these questions, I intend to move in the Senate an amendment to the standing orders to ensure that questions on notice given to Senate committees also come under this 30-day rule. I will move it because of the tardiness of Mr Walker and others in supplying answers to estimates committees. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke this morning to the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, who denies absolutely the remarks attributed to him by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in an article which appeared in that newspaper on Saturday morning. The article, in part, read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday, a tax office spokesman said the Tax Commissioner was considering referring Senator Baume's actions to the police, the Federal Director of Public Prosecutions and the Privacy Commissioner for investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>In simple terms, that is a lie. The commissioner himself told me today that he was overseas at the time, that he had not addressed the matter and he is not considering doing so. He told me that, as far as he can ascertain, no tax official made such a statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who did? What shonky, crooked, dishonest person pretended to be speaking for the tax commissioner? This matter is being handled by the second commissioner, Mr Simpson. It is remarkable that the wording of paragraph 9 in his memorandum of Friday 24 March to Mr Willis is exactly the same as the statement that was incorporated in, and reported by, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. The statement in the confidential minute of 24 March read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am considering whether the matter will be referred to the Privacy Commissioner, Australian Federal Police or the Director of Public Prosecutions for further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, someone has some explaining to do about this political stunt, this attempt to politically hang me. I demand an explanation. Will Mr Willis come clean? Did he or anyone in his office pass himself or herself off as an officer of the taxation department in an attempt to damage me? If Mr Willis did not do so, did he authorise any member of his staff to pass himself or herself off as a representative of the taxation department. I demand an answer from Mr Willis. I remind whoever did that that they did so without the protection of the privileges of this parliament. I remind them that this kind of deception is simply and uncomplicatedly illegal. Mr Willis has a duty to reveal who performed this illegal act, passing himself or herself off to be an officer of the tax department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that Mr Willis may have been put up to this by the joint intelligence of the second commissioner and Mr Gear.

This is absolute rubbish; it is politically designed to be hurled at me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the application of parliamentary privilege destroys this proposition totally. Journalists can take comfort from the fact that they are protected by section 16D of that act which provides that privilege applies to publications of documents published pursuant to an order of the house, as is the case on this occasion. Even worse, the second commissioner cannot even read his own act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 8WB that he refers to is simply irrelevant. It does not apply in this situation. This section says that a person shall not record another person's tax file number or maintain such a record. I made no record of another person's tax file number and therefore could not be accused of maintaining a record. I did not make a record in the first place. I received the document and held it for a few hours until tabling. I did not record it or maintain it under any quaint or exotic interpretation of section 8WB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is yet another piece of politically oriented nonsense which represents a contemptible abuse of power by Mr Willis, Mr Gear and, regrettably, Mr Simpson, the second assistant tax commissioner.

The fact is that he tabled a letter from the second commissioner, Mr Simpson, purporting to show that I may have committed a criminal act in simply possessing the tax file number of Dr Macdonald and that parliamentary privilege may not cover my actions, leaving open the possibility that I could face charges for breaching the Taxation Administration Act. That is a blatant lie, and Mr Willis knows it to be a lie. It is part of a dishonest beat-up aimed at grabbing a headline. I used to regard Mr Willis as decent but dull.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will recall that on 8 November 1994 the Senate referred the following matter to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report, at that stage by 1 December 1994: whether the existing disclosure provisions for Prime Ministers and leaders of the opposition are credible; whether Prime Ministers and leaders of the opposition should be accountable for their acquisition of assets and liabilities while in office and, if so, to whom; and whether the details to be revealed should be similar to those required of ministers under existing cabinet rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate would be interested to know that this committee met on several occasions and was at great pains to arrive at some sort of consensus. The product of the eight meetings of this committee was five pages and three lines that honourable senators will find recorded in our report. The committee sought and received a submission from both the government and the opposition on this matter. These submissions are included in the five and bit pages as appendix 1 and 2. A further submission was received from Senator Baume and that is included in full as appendix 3. That makes at least a presentable number of pages. As a committee, we expended a great deal of energy in achieving the pages that we have here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As chair of the committee, I must say that it was not an easy process, but in the end it was made a little easier when we arrived at the following paragraph on page 4 of the report. The paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, having examined the current provisions in Australia, compared these with other countries and taken note of the limited evidence available, the Committee finds itself divided on the issue of the adequacy of the current disclosure provisions. The various views are set out in the following paragraphs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, in essence, the tenor of the report. We actually set out the opposing views in the following paragraphs. I think honourable senators will be entertained to read those because they record&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I would do a lot better, Senator Watson, if I was not continually harangued from the side. I intend to do just what you want if only you will let me speak. As I indicated, those various views are representative and follow along the general lines of what I will now quote. The report continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some members of the Committee regard it as a major problem for the head of the executive government not to be required to disclose any changes in the value of assets and liabilities because government decisions can have very important effects on personal wealth. These Senators favour changes in the current disclosure provisions for Prime Ministers and Leaders of the Opposition along the lines proposed in the Leader of the Opposition's submission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The following paragraph points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other members of the Committee, while recognising that differences do exist, point out that the obligation of ministers, who have to declare values as well as the nature of interests, is greater than for other senators and members, though such declarations of values are not made public. These Senators also point out that the Prime Minister, being aware of his/her own assets has no need to declare them to another person, since the purpose of ministerial declaration is to assist the Prime Minister to make judgments about the proper conduct of internal executive business. These Senators accept that it is not appropriate for the Parliament to involve itself in prescribing how Cabinet operates.</PARA>
<PARA>I again quote from what we agreed to in our report because, for those who want to see what this committee did and how it dealt with those opposing views, I think there are two matters of consensus which are important to illustrate. We found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding that even the most stringent disclosure provisions cannot ensure the highest level of accountability and avoidance of conflict of interest in practice, the Committee believes that appropriate levels of accountability are essential in a modern democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that as a truism is a little hard to avoid. Nevertheless, we were able as a committee, which was struggling to find agreement on anything, to find agreement on that point at least. As I said, the tenor of the report was mainly that we exposed the differing opinions and at least saw the value of having some disclosure in a modern democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found that one of the most important observations I could make was that we did not actually receive any evidence which demonstrated the value of adopting any overseas practice as a model for Australia, despite the fact that it has been contended in here and in other places that the concept of the United States, Japanese, Italian model or some other model might be worth following. We saw no evidence which demonstrated that, by following any of those models, we could ensure that there would be no conflict of interest in the parliamentary houses; in fact, quite the contrary. If senators would cast their minds to the situations that exist in any of those overseas countries, I am sure with any honesty one would have to admit that there is no capacity to demonstrate that the Japanese, Italian or United States models by themselves prevent any conflicts of interest. The report is brief; however, the appendices make interesting reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few very brief comments on the report by the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. Senator Bell, the chairman of the committee, pointed out that this was a difficult report to prepare and there were considerable divisions on the committee. Although Senator Bell would be aware that I have sometimes been critical of the way he may conduct himself from time to time, he did an excellent job in making sure that we worked through this very difficult process to try to get a report which made a contribution to what is a very important debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hold the view that the man or woman who holds the senior office in this country has a full-time job and has no business in business. That person has no business in borrowing, or lending, or selling or what have you and basically has to concentrate on the full-time job. The conflicts of interest are immense. If you are the Prime Minister of the country, there is no question that the decisions and appointments you make are extremely important and it would be a great pity if there were conflicts of interest. So that is the position I am coming from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point the committee discovered&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;was that, although ministers are accountable to the Prime Minister for the value of their assets and transactions that they make in the selling of assets and borrowings and have to notify the Prime Minister of changes in the value of the assets they hold, no such requirement is made of the Prime Minister. The most powerful man or woman in the land is exempt from any form of disclosure along the lines which is required of ministers. People have started to focus on this issue because they are concerned about a Prime Minister who involves himself in very expensive business transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pointed out in a submission by Mr Alexander Downer that there have been a number of case studies where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has apparently involved himself in large scale transactions&mdash;whether it be the purchase of a $2.2 million home or the sale of a piggery. Apparently no-one is informed and there is no bit of paper around in which the Prime Minister is forced to disclose these transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, what we came through with the committee was, at the very minimum, to try to look at an example of how the Prime Minister could be put in a similar position as the ministers. If Senator Robert Ray, who is in the chamber, spends up big and purchases shares and sells shares, he has to go along to the Prime Minister and say, `Paul, here is a bit of paper. I've made a million here, I've lost half a million here and I've borrowed $3 million there.' That is what Senator Ray has to do. But if Mr Keating does exactly the same thing as Senator Ray, he does not have to tell anybody. In fact, you can be absolutely assured that he will not tell anybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how can we put Mr Keating in the same position as Senator Ray in relation to accountability and disclosure? I draw the Senate's attention to a few excellent sentences in this report. For example, when Mr Keating conducts one of his large scale transactions, it would be possible for him to disclose this to the presiding officers. Alternatively, the Prime Minister could be required to disclose it to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate. This would put the Prime Minister in precisely the same position as Senator Ray is currently in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we could not reach a consensus majority view on this report, it will have to rely, as they say, on the court of public opinion. Hopefully, when interested people see this report, they will understand the enormous anomaly we have at the moment; that is, there is no effective disclosure or accountability by the Prime Minister&mdash;and, particularly, at present we seem to have a Prime Minister who is very active in business type transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report to the Senate. I think it should be read. There is a diversity of views expressed in it. In the end, one of the strengths of the Senate committee system is that we can work through these issues and present a report which, even if somewhat difficult to read, at least makes a number of important points. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, old money. There are different standards. I just make those comments in passing to point out that there is not a consistency of attitude in the opposition. The position that I took on this matter was simple: that the rules that apply to ministers, and which the opposition sought to want to vary in respect of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), were internal rules of the cabinet. Basically, I have accepted that that set of rules is an internal matter to the cabinet, and there is no precedent for the parliament purporting to involve itself in the way in which the cabinet operates. That, I think, is basic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have been strong for many years about the issue of revelation of pecuniary interests. The extent to which the revelation of pecuniary interests has gone up until now has been on the question of the nature of pecuniary interests. As we say in the report, on the public revelation of values, there are good arguments for and against. I can see both sides of that story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I take the position that, if the parliament is to consider extending its current pecuniary interest rules, it should do so only in a way in which they would apply consistently to all senators and members. That would mean that all those exercising significant power in their various ways should all be affected similarly by any rules which the parliament itself prescribes. And those exercising significant power would include the Prime Minister&mdash;and nobody suggests that the Prime Minister does not exercise significant power&mdash;the Treasurer (Mr Willis), other ministers, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and shadow ministers. The leaders of the largest party in the Senate exercise very considerable powers. Those senators with the balance of power exercise considerable powers. Chairs and members of parliamentary committees, in their own way, exercise power. Particular members and senators, who might not have an office in here but who have special influence within their parties, exercise power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be a reasonable expectation of the electorate that the value of interests be openly available so that judgments can be made as to whether or not decision making is affected by personal interests. That is just an extra step beyond the revelation of the nature of interests which occurs for all of us, including the Prime Minister now. But, if it is to be so, it would only be fair if all those making such decisions&mdash;which I think vary in their significance only by degree&mdash;were to be equally affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is currently a review of the whole question of pecuniary interests by the committee of the Senate which has been appointed for that purpose. It is within that committee's jurisdiction to consider these issues. So, if there are people proposing that there should be now values revealed as well as nature, it is submissions to that committee which should deal with the matter and have us all affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we say in the report, the Senate committee is permitted, by its terms of reference, to meet with its equivalent committee of the House of Representatives. It is firmly suggested by those of us who take this view that that committee should propose doing so, to ensure that there is a common approach in both houses and that a desired consistent level of disclosure affecting all of us should be achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The presentation of the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee is a timely reminder to this Senate of just how standards of propriety have dropped in the last few decades. I remind the Senate of the very high standards set under the Menzies regime, when ministers were required to divest themselves, for example, of all shares in public companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came home very strongly to me when a former senator for Tasmania, who was a member of the Menzies ministry, the late Senator Henty, was required to divest himself of his very modest shareholdings. I would remind the Senate also that Mr Menzies himself did not enrich himself during his time in this place. In fact, as Prime Minister for very many years&mdash;in fact, the longest serving Prime Minister&mdash;he died a man of modest means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have a situation where ministers quite properly have to detail to the Prime Minister their interests in various assets&mdash;and I would have thought this is a minimum requirement. They also not only have to describe the nature of those assets but also the values that attach to them. But what is surprising is that, in turn, the Prime Minister is not required to reciprocate in any way whatsoever to his deputy leader, his cabinet, his ministers, or anybody. I am not necessarily asking that he divulge value details to the world at large. I would have thought that the most powerful person in this land, the Prime Minister, should have to report to someone. But this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also use this occasion to draw attention to my concern with what I believe is a great variation in the manner in which assets are disclosed. It does appear that, if members of parliament&mdash;whether a Prime Minister, a minister or a backbencher&mdash;put their assets in a trust form, they are somehow excluded from disclosing those assets behind that trust framework. For example, if a person holds assets individually, in a partnership or in a private company, the assets are required to spell out the investments in great detail behind the particular holding instrument. Yet, if a person holds the assets in the form of a trust&mdash;and there are people, including back benchers, ministers, and the Prime Minister, who hold them in the form of a trust&mdash;for the general disclosure register which is presented to this parliament and is available to the press that the interests behind those holdings do not appear to be mandated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would have thought that there needs to be a great deal of tidying up in terms of the manner in which holdings have to be described. That applies from the Prime Minister right down to the most lowly person here. I also take this opportunity of acknowledging that the clerks of the</PARA>
<PARA>Senate in terms of their role in this place have taken on themselves voluntary disclosure. That is an acknowledgement of their professionalism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a result of my request that this inquiry took place. There is enormous irony in that today this report&mdash;in my view a very poor majority report and a very sensible minority report&mdash;has come to us. It is an irony that it comes to us on a day when I have been censured by the House of Representatives for revealing the hidden truth about a parliamentarian's massive understatement of his tax. How ludicrous are the present revelation requirements anyway when it is a matter of such substance that when I revealed the understatement of income of $104,000 I should be censured for that and here we are talking about rejecting in this report any suggestion that one particular member of parliament, the Prime Minister, should be obliged to make any revelation at all about the state of his finances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that irony, we have to recognise that a lack of public confidence in the integrity of Australian politicians has developed over recent years often as a result of their failure to disclose the reality of their position. For example, Dr Macdonald failed to disclose that he had understated his income, he says inadvertently, by $104,000. There was the failure to disclose his interest by the Prime Minister, for example, when he misled the chambers of this parliament by saying that he only had an interest in a company which had an interest in a piggery when, in fact, he owned half of a company which wholly owned a piggery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you get people misleading the chamber in that way because `an interest in' clearly does not indicate whole ownership, it cannot be stretched to mean whole ownership, the public of Australia naturally will feel they have been deceived by politicians who use that kind of device and that kind of language and a real need emerges for us to make certain exactly what we are about when we say there is disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know perfectly well that the level of disclosure, for example, among ministers is much higher than that required of ordinary members of parliament. So it should be, because ministers have a particular responsibility. No minister has a greater responsibility than the Prime Minister because his responsibility extends over the whole range of government. So there is pressure on the Prime Minister to, if you like, be responsible to someone, to disclose to someone, what his or her assets are&mdash;and liabilities, particularly in view of some extraordinary debts we have seen to the Commonwealth Bank in relation to the piggery. It is vital that at least there should be a revelation to someone to ensure that the question of conflict of interest or the potential for conflict of interest is resolved. Whether it is resolved satisfactorily is another matter, but at least it is resolved within the cabinet because there are clear cabinet rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministers must reveal to their Prime Minister where they have an interest that may well be a conflict of interest and they also have to reveal the value of their assets and liabilities to the Prime Minister. That seems to me to be a sensible thing. That remains confidential within the cabinet. But at least the Prime Minister knows whether one of his ministers stands to gain or lose as a result of the decision of the cabinet or the decisions of that minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what about this Prime Minister? When this Prime Minister was a member of Mr Hawke's cabinet he failed to reveal under the cabinet rules to Mr Hawke that he had acquired half ownership of a company for $413,000, a substantial amount, which totally owned a piggery group and a refrigeration group. Mr Hawke was never ever advised of that fact. Mr Keating was supposed to have advised him immediately, according to cabinet rules. It was only three or four weeks later when Mr Keating had resigned from the cabinet that eventually a normal statement of declaration was made as a backbencher to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When you get people who break the rules you then have a special need to make certain that the rules are capable of being applied properly. The problem is that with the Prime Minister there are no rules. He does not have to report to anyone. That was the reason I raised this matter. If it had not been for the events of the last couple of years with the present Prime Minister, there would have been no pressure to change the situation which had existed. It appears on the face of it, at least, to have resulted in no misleading of the public ever since Federation. I do not know of anyone who has made any allegations of any previous Prime Minister having misled the people of Australia about his assets or liabilities, despite some incredibly vicious attacks on Mr Fraser by Mr Keating when he was in opposition about his ownership of a property in Victoria, which was well-known before Mr Fraser got elected to parliament. Changed circumstances means there is a need for change in the requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report does not accept any of my four recommendations&mdash;that the Prime Minister should make the same disclosure relating to new private interests required by ministers to him under the cabinet rules to the parliament in the public document or the Governor-General in a private document or the Auditor-General in a private document or the Deputy Prime Minister in a private document. The minority report has chosen some other alternatives. They are a decided improvement on the present situation and I strongly support and recommend the minority report contained in this report. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Sentor West this day, relating to the drought in the Upper Hunter Valley region.</PARA>
<PARA>I have been in the Senate for four years and I have been involved with Senator Collins on a number of issues, including shipping and communications and now rural affairs. I note that when Senator Collins gets in a corner he has a tactic. The tactic is to take a small item in support of his case and then not give you the full story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a classic example of that this afternoon. The minister's response to what I was saying about his abject failure to include in the extreme drought declared areas the Upper Hunter was that there has not been anything from the New South Wales government on this matter for four months. That illustrates the point I just made. On 16 November last year, 4 1/2 months ago, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr Causley, wrote to the minister and his reply was received on 16 December. So in a way Senator Collins has misled us because this matter was active four months ago. The minister's reply was received 3 1/2 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell the Senate and put on record what all this correspondence was about. The first letter came from the New South Wales Farmers Association. It is a letter to Minister Causley dated 11 November. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a survey of NSW Farmers' Association General Councillors, we request the following Rural Lands Protection Board areas be classified Exceptional Circumstance either in whole or in part . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to list 14 areas, including Gloucester, Maitland, Denman, Merriwa and Scone. That was the request on the 11th. On the 16th the minister wrote to Senator Collins. In part, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would reiterate that the New South Wales' position continues to be that at the very least the six Rural Lands Protection Board areas which were previously proposed should now be declared as being in an exceptional drought (Grafton, Mudgee, Nyngan, Merriwa, Scone and Dubbo).</PARA>
<PARA>Merriwa and Scone are in the Upper Hunter. In other words, out of those 14 the New South Wales minister was putting those in the top six&mdash;yet the federal minister has ignored those areas and has included some of those other regions in extreme drought. They have been included since 1 December. Why? I have pointed it out to the Senate before: those areas were in marginal seats. Of course, poor old Merriwa, Denman and Scone are not in marginal seats. So it is bad luck for them&mdash;they have missed out. Minister Collins wrote back on 16 December to Minister Causley saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has concluded that your request for support in the remaining Districts does not meet the . . . criteria and is therefore unable to agree to your request.</PARA>
<PARA>So Minister Collins knocked back that request 3 1/2 months ago. The minister is saying that the New South Wales government has been tardy on this. It got a request from the farmers, it responded a week later, the minister knocked it back a month later, the area is still in extreme drought&mdash;nothing has changed in the Upper Hunter except that the drought has got worse since that time&mdash;and this do-nothing minister has done nothing for the people of the Upper Hunter and continues to refuse to do anything for the people of the Upper Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was most disingenuous of the minister to come in here this afternoon during question time while it was being broadcast and make out it was all the fault of the New South Wales government when clearly it is not. The guidelines, or lack of guidelines, he has put down for reapplying leaves this whole area very muddy about when and how states should reapply for this sort of grant. So we cannot blame the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's position this afternoon is even more inexcusable when we take into account that he misled the Scone delegation of farmers who took him at his word in his office to have RASAC consider the eligibility of the Upper Hunter. The exceptional circumstances relief drought package was supposed to give cash support relief and it continues to discriminate against those in need. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We note that you have applied to the Federal Government for six of these areas to be added to the exceptional circumstance list. However, following our survey, we believe there is a strong case for declaring divisions of RLPB areas as being in exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the Association has included RLPB areas that may be severely drought affected only in part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association proposes a scheme to administer Exceptional Circumstance declarations that encompasses the criteria agreed at ARMCANZ and would allow ongoing flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Farmers' Association proposes that as well as whole RLPB areas being declared exceptional circumstance that divisions within RLPB areas are also able to be declared exceptional circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would occur on an ongoing monthly basis, precisely the same way that monthly drought declarations are made, except in the case of exceptional circumstance declarations, final approval would rest with the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, Rural Land Protection Boards would not only conduct a monthly evaluation of drought in their Board areas but also, using the six new criteria, would evaluate whether those areas or divisions within the areas should be added to the Exceptional Circumstance list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board's recommendations on exceptional circumstance inclusion would be forwarded to the Federal Government for final approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This system also allows the scope for individual declarations of exceptional circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a farmer lives in a division of an RLPB area that has not been judged by the Rural Lands Protection Board as in exceptional circumstance he would be able to apply to the Board for an individual classification. The Board, using the six criteria, would evaluate his situation and if approved would forward his application to the Federal Government for final approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would lessen the inherent problems of a system where lines are drawn on a map. Both the Federal and State Governments have conceded the shortcomings of drawing lines. Our suggestion of a `salvage provision' would help to overcome inbuilt discrimination in the current system.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also stated in that letter that it was proving difficult to complete the submission because the Commonwealth has yet to finalise the indicators by which exceptional circumstances are to be judged under the six core criteria.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your submission was referred to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council for advice prior to consideration by the Government and was assessed against the core criteria agreed by the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) on 28 October.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you will be aware, the Government has concluded that your requests for support in the Districts of Casino, Grafton, Kempsey, Gloucester and Maitland meet the ARMCANZ criteria and has agreed to extend support to these Districts. I will issue amended guidelines for this purpose shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has concluded that your request for support in the remaining Districts does not meet the ARMCANZ criteria and is therefore unable to agree to your request. However, the Government is concerned that structural adjustment pressures are being exacerbated by normal drought conditions resulting in considerable hardship within the central west of the State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is therefore prepared to provide additional funds from the Rural Adjustment Scheme regional adjustment program to assist structural adjustment within the central west region and has agreed to extend the grant period for farm household support up to a maximum of two years in the Western Division and central west of NSW. Assistance for regional adjustment would be provided as an extension to our previous offer to fund adjustment within the Western Division. I would therefore urge that discussions between officials commence as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA>My question related to the funding that the Commonwealth government will provide to those student unions and associations which now have voluntary membership. In particular I address my remarks to those institutions in Western Australia. What will happen is that, due to the shortfall in membership of those student unions and associations because they are now voluntary, the government will top up their income using taxpayers' money. That taxpayers' money will come from funding which was otherwise destined for schools, teachers, books and other expenses associated with educational matters in that state. I can tell the Senate that since voluntary membership came into being 30 per cent of students have enrolled in the student union at Murdoch&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Abetz will be even more surprised to hear that only eight per cent enrolled at Edith Cowan University. At the University of Western Australia the figure is 24 per cent and at Curtin University, 12.5 per cent. Such low enrolment figures are certainly not a ringing endorsement of the various student bodies. These figures obviously mean that students, when given the choice, do not want to join their student union or student association. This is despite some of these bodies halving their annual fee. They are halving their annual fee, and that is all they can get. That is the sum total of membership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister told us today that his department has had representations on two occasions from Western Australian student bodies and that guidelines were set down on 14 March this year in relation to the top-up funding of these student bodies. The problem is that they cannot get membership. They cannot get membership whilst they are voluntary, so the government will top them up with money taken out of the state's grants which were given to it for other educational expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of my question is that taxpayers of this country need to know that this government is subsidising student unions and associations which are incapable of maintaining or attracting anywhere near 100 per cent membership. In fact, we have figures showing that it is as low as 12.5 per cent and eight per cent. That tells the story. If these bodies cannot offer services, if they cannot offer any attraction to new students who are enrolling and those students who are re-enrolling, why should they be topped up with taxpayers' money? Why should they be subsidised? Why should other areas which need the money&mdash;education is an area which can never have too many dollars&mdash;go without and that money be used for subsidising student unions and associations? The Western Australian government, by bringing in voluntary student union membership, has demonstrated the very point that these bodies have been propped up over the years by compulsory membership. Senator Schacht says it is an ideological thing. It certainly is, and I do not shirk from that fact one bit. I stand by my belief that it should be voluntary association and I stand against compulsory membership of any association. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the Labor Party, desperate to retain the moneys that it has got from these student unions, had to manufacture a way to ensure that it could continue to receive that money. The Labor Party is a master at that. For example, the Australian Conservation Foundation had a shortfall of $500,000 in public donations in the past 12 months. With public support waning, what does the federal government do? It weighs in with an extra $600,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With student unions in the west, students are given a choice and they vote with their feet by walking out. The highest level of membership is 30 per cent. What a disgraceful record for the leadership of those student unions and student associations. They can attract only 30 per cent of their peers to be members, yet the federal government says, `We will top up that fund.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disgraceful thing about the federal government policy is that the student union that attracted the fewest members&mdash;that is, the one with eight per cent&mdash;will have the 92 per cent shortfall made up out of taxpayers' funds. So the more irresponsible the leadership of the student union is, the fewer members it has, the more money it will get from the federal government as an incentive to be less representative of the students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anything, the federal government ought to be providing an incentive to student unions and student organisations so that the more representative they are, the more members they get, the more support they get from the federal government. But in this case it is the reverse. The more unrepresentative you are, the fewer members you have got, the more money you are going to get from the taxpayer of Australia at the expense of the particular state. At the expense of the particular state means that state governments will not be able to match the federal government dollar for dollar on drought relief, on roadworks, on hospitals, on police and on all those other important infrastructure matters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>It would be remiss of me not to take note of Senator Gareth Evans's inadequate answer to Senator Alston's question about the current account deficit. We have had released today the current account deficit for February showing another appalling figure of a deficit of $2,165 million. For the seventh time in the last eight months, we have had a current account deficit of over $2,000 million. This fits in with the government forecast because the government has had to increase the budget forecast for the current account deficit for 1994-95 by over 50 per cent to $26 billion for 1994-95. This disastrous February figure simply confirms that we are on track to probably the worst current account deficit outcome we have ever had. </PARA>

This is an utterly inadequate and irresponsible response from this government. We are dealing with a situation where our foreign debt is over $160,000 million.

That is the fundamental problem in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will recall that a key issue in the inquiry was the refusal of the government to provide the committee with documents based on an undemonstrated claim of public interest immunity. The deputy chair of the committee, Senator Kernot, introduced a private senator's bill, the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994, proposing a judicial mechanism for resolving such conflicts. The bill was referred to the Privileges Committee, which concluded that the bill should not be proceeded with as it was unnecessary. The Senate and its committees, in the opinion of the Privileges Committee, already possessed the powers necessary to resolve such conflicts and needed only to use them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee drew attention to the usefulness of an independent arbitrator in such cases. In a subsequent report, it noted that the Acting Auditor-General had performed this role in relation to the government's refusal to table information in the Senate relating to the lease of Casselden Place. In this context, Senator Kernot's proposal for a select committee of party leaders may be a useful device to consider when the inevitable happens and the government again attempts to withhold information from the Senate or its committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also required to review the government's response to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Percentage players </EMPHASIS>and to monitor any developments in the Federal Court in INP Consortium Ltd and others v John Fairfax Holdings Ltd, formerly Tourang Ltd, and others concerning the possible use in open court of documents supplied in confidence to named counsel in that case but denied to the committee by the government.

Calls for reform in this area were not limited to the majority report. The dissenting report by ALP senators also contained  recommendations for the review of FIRB processes. Three months was the standard response time agreed to by this government when it came into office. I ask where that response is. </PARA>

The phrase `balanced coverage' was used.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the foreign ownership of our newspapers is a vexed and very important one. Since the interim report by the committee, we have recently seen this matter flare again. Kerry Packer and Conrad Black are again talking about increased holdings in the Fairfax empire. This matter just will not go away. I believe that this inquiry will stand for some time as a guide to any persons who want to acquaint themselves with this very complex area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The litigation that Senator Minchin has mentioned, which is the largest commercial case in Australia's history, revolves around just how the local bidder for the Fairfax empire was kept out. In the minute from FIRB, its expertise and financial backing were discussed in its absence. In other words, the domestic bidder was criticised during the  consideration process by the Foreign Investment Review Board without any input from it or reference to it. The Australian bidder was not aware that this was going on at the time. In effect, the foreign purchaser was allowed into the marketplace because an adverse decision had been made in relation to the local bidder. That was entirely unsatisfactory. That is what the committee really seized upon in its report. It is a most important aspect. The Foreign Investment Review Board would not provide to the committee full details of its process. We could only go on the leaked minute and come to conclusions from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommended that there be guidelines in relation to foreign ownership. It also recommended that the whole process be more transparent and that the issue should not be dealt with by winks, nudges and nods. The people of Australia need a more transparent process by which they can know how the foreign ownership of their press is determined. That is a very important aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin touched eloquently on the aspect of the government holding back documents from Senate committees. During this inquiry, the government placed a brick wall in the way of the committee. It would not provide the committee with information which was essential to its inquiry. I believe it is also for this reason that this inquiry will stand, perhaps for much longer than foreign media ownership, as a guide to the operation of Senate committees and just how the executive can get in the way of an inquiry on behalf of the people via a Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that report, a good deal of material touches on that issue. Senator Kernot's private senator's bill, which was introduced as a result of this situation, highlighted a problem which still exists today; that is, what do you do with the executive when it refuses to give information to a Senate committee which is properly sought and which is essential to the inquiry before it? That problem has not been resolved. It is a matter that will not go away. I venture to say that it will be visiting us again and again. In the future, we will be visiting this report again to look at this example of where a government could stand in the way of an inquiry. For those reasons, I believe this report is a very important one that will stand the test of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the print media inquiry, on which Senator Minchin, Senator Ellison and I served, two aspects were looked at. The first was the question of balanced coverage in response to Mr Black's request to the Keating government to increase the Black ownership of John Fairfax from 15 to 25 per cent. Mr Black admitted that it was probably an unfortunate or not very useful word to use in terms of the arrangements that he had come to with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his hope and expectation that he would be able to increase his ownership of John Fairfax after the election if the Keating government were to be returned in 1993. As the Keating government was returned after the 1993 election, it became quite legitimate for us to inquire into how this was possible and whether an arrangement had been entered into before the election which then came to pass afterwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of whether there had been so-called balanced coverage in terms of the arrangement between Mr Black and Mr Keating was only part of the committee's findings. The committee report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Percentage players</EMPHASIS>, really dealt with the Foreign Investment Review Board, which was one of its most important aspects. We are a capital importing nation; we always have been. The operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board does have a great impact on our development, and will for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that any foreign investment review body, committee or commission must be intensely accountable. It must be transparent in its operation. The future recommendations that the committee made in connection with the operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board or the body that deals with foreign investment in the future will have a lasting benefit to a coalition government when it has the chance to look into the guidelines that should apply. As I said, it is a very transparent process that is determined for the future. In those major areas of investment, such as agriculture, banking and aviation, where a government should argue its case in the public arena if the normal expectations of the foreign investor as determined by precedent are not met, it is something that we will certainly adhere to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that, at the end of the day, what is in the national interest is something that is determined by the government. But the government, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister must be prepared to argue their case on behalf of the government in the public arena. That certainly has not been the case in this instance and it certainly has not been the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin mentioned the question of public interest immunity that was claimed by the government in terms of public officers and members of the FIRB who did not come before us and would not answer questions. We felt that Senator Kernot's private senator's bill might have resolved the problem and might have been appropriate. As Senator Minchin said, her bill went to the Privileges Committee, but it was decided by the Privileges Committee that the bill was not necessary. It was a power that the Senate had already. The exercise of the power to decide what is public interest immunity is intensely political. That power is held by any court that determines what rights a potential witness has to withhold information and not to appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I wish to make is that the government has had nine months to respond to this report, and it has not done so. As Senator Minchin said, normally the government is given three months. It is hoped that the government will respond to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Percentage players</EMPHASIS> report. It is very much an example of the fact that at least the Senate committee can make the government accountable to the extent that it has and to respond to our recommendations. I look forward to the government's response. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is an omnibus measure which proposes amendments to 6 pieces of legislation for which the Australian Customs Service ("the ACS") has functional and administrative responsibility:  the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Administration Act 1985, the Excise Act 1901, the Distillation Act 1901, the Spirits Act 1906 and the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal policy initiatives reflected in the provisions of the bill effect amendments to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) the main pieces of Customs legislation, to give effect to the Government's response to the Review of the Australian Customs Service (the "Conroy Review") and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) the Customs Act 1901, to extend the special rules of origin preference concessions to Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and the other Forum Island Countries. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Review of the Australian Customs Service</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill marks the Government's legislative response to the recommendations by the Committee of Review of the Australian Customs Service, which was tabled in the Parliament on 8 February of last year.  The Committee, which was chaired by Mr Frank Conroy, with Ms Susan Ryan and Mr Ian MacPhee as members, conducted a wide ranging examination of the organisation, operations and practices of the Australian Customs Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review was commissioned in May 1993, to ensure the shortcomings identified in a number of Parliamentary inquiries (the most glaring of which was the Joint Committee of Public Accounts final report in December 1992 on the Midford-Paramount case) were corrected, and at the same time, the essential strengths of Customs were enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Conroy Committee's Report, "The Turning Point", found that substantial change in the culture and operations of Customs was needed to address deficiencies in policies, priorities and structural arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In announcing the Government's strong support of the Report's recommendations on 26 April 1994, the Government highlighted its commitment to achieving a highly efficient Customs Service more closely attuned to the needs of its private and public sector clients. The need to change the thinking, culture and operational approaches of Customs, which have been dominated by an emphasis on revenue collection and law enforcement, was accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is a major step by the Government to bring about that significant change to the Service, through the operation of the Customs Act 1901. It will introduce standards of procedure and practice into this Act that will make it appropriate to Australia as a major international trading nation well into the 21st Century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's expectation that the implementation of the reforms proposed by the bill will further assist Customs in fulfilling Australia's expectation of a more appropriate balance between Customs' community and barrier protection roles, and its trade facilitation and industry assistance functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government proposes in this bill to place judicial control over the granting of powers to search for evidence of Customs offences and the power of Customs officers to seize goods suspected of being forfeited goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope of such powers, and their potential to harm the community, were regrettably made apparent in the Report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, "The Midford Paramount Case and Related Matters".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes two substantive reforms in this area. It not only addresses present inadequacies, but it also improves the standard for the use of such enforcement provisions beyond that presently applicable to other Australian agencies with similar enforcement powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first reform is to bring the power of seizure under judicial control by requiring seizures to be sanctioned by a judicial officer having regard to the appropriateness and necessity of seizure in all the circumstances, before the seizure can be effected. This appears as the new Subdivision D of Division 1 of Part XII of the Customs Act 1901. A similar extension of judicial control over the granting of search warrants for evidence of an offences under the Customs legislation is also proposed, and appears in Subdivision C of Division 1 of Part XII of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second substantive reform proposed in this area governs activity post-seizure. The Government considered that the corollary to reform of seizure at the front end necessitated similar reform once a seizure was effected. Hence, the provisions in Subdivisions F and G of Division 1 of Part XII of the Customs Act 1901, to make clear that one's ability to retain that which has been seized is expressly dependent upon the bringing of the proceedings which justified the seizure in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Giving effect to these two major policy reforms has involved a substantial rewrite of Division 1 of Part XII of the Customs Act 1901. That in part was made necessary because it was considered current policy on the use of search warrants by Commonwealth officers, (including the contents of the warrants and their execution) which were contained in the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment 1994 Act, passed by this Parliament last year, had to be reflected in these Customs Act 1901 provisions. The provisions contained in new subdivisions A-K of Division 1 of Part XII of the Customs Act 1901, inserted by Schedule 2 of this bill, have thus been modelled with strict adherence to that precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes the structural and organisational reforms to the Australian Customs Service which were recommended in the Conroy Report, to introduce the position of Chief Executive Officer with a 5 year term of appointment (Schedules 3 and 7 of the bill refer) and to provide the Minister with an ability to give written directions to the Chief Executive Officer with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the administration of the Australian Customs Service (Schedule 3 to the bill refers).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepted the Conroy Report's view that for Customs to meet the Government's industry oriented policies, a structure was required to provide the Minister with clear power to communicate policy focused directions to Customs. The amendments proposed in Schedule 3 of the bill should meet this need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rules of Origin Amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second major policy initiative reflected in the bill concerns the extension of certain administrative elements of the rules of origin preference concessions to Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the other Forum Island Countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April 1994, Australia implemented new rules of origin legislation to give effect to the agreement reached with New Zealand in the context of the 1992 Review of Closer Economic Relations (CER) and to extend to other preference countries the administrative and technical aspects of that agree ment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has now made commitments with Fiji in respect of the rules of origin arrangements applying to the Forum Island Countries. The Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry, which is the domestic sector with the predominant interest in rules of origin arrangements relating to the Forum Island Countries, was consulted during the negotiation phase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill incorporates the legislative amendments required to give effect to the new arrangements for these countries, and corrects some errors and omissions in the existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Papua New Guinea is mentioned separately but conjointly in each case where the Forum Island Countries are mentioned because, while it is party to the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) between Australia and the Forum Island Countries, for customs tariff purposes it is regarded as an entity independent of the Forum Island Countries, in recognition of its status under the Papua New Guinea&mdash;Australia Trade and Commercial Relations Agreement (PATCRA). In my following comments, reference to the Forum Island Countries should accordingly be taken to include Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provisions for the Forum Island Countries include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inland freight, from the port or airport where the materials are first landed in the preference country manufacturing the goods to the factory in that country, will become allowable expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inland freight is already an allowable expenditure where it relates to materials which originate in the preference area. The legislation will in addition recognise as allowable expenditure the inland freight component applying to materials originating from outside the preference area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concession on inland freight will only be available to the Forum Island Countries. It will not apply to New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia or the Developing Countries. Inland freight on the foreign content of materials will not be eligible expenditure if it occurs in Australia or in a Forum Island Country other than that Forum Island Country manufacturing the preference goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of materials for manufacture of the final product will be considered to be totally of allowable expenditure where the allowable expenditure on these materials which is contributed by Australia and the Forum Island Country where the last process of manufacture occurs is at least 50 per cent. A similar provision is already available in relation to trans-Tasman trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will remove the requirement, where New Zealand content is involved, for the Forum Island Countries to achieve at least one half of the minimum 50 per cent of the total factory cost, with the balance made up from Australia and New Zealand. Prior to duty free trans-Tasman trade, it was necessary to ensure that the Forum Island Countries were not used as a means to get goods into Australia duty free which were essentially the manufacture of New Zealand, and as such subject to an import duty. Trans-Tasman trade became duty free in 1990, so this provision no longer serves any useful purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 2 per cent margin of tolerance on the 50 per cent qualifying content requirement as agreed with New Zealand will be extended to the Forum Island Countries. This means that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">where the percentage of allowable factory or works cost for a Forum Island Country shipment of particular goods would have been 50 per cent if it had not been for some unforeseen circumstance such as a fluctuation in exchange rates which is unlikely to continue; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the allowable factory or works cost for those goods is not less than 48 per cent</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">then for the purpose of that shipment and subsequent shipments of similar goods, affected in the same way over a specified period, the allowable factory cost will be deemed to be 50 per cent. The intention of this provision is to allow a limited period of time for adjustment where goods fail temporarily to meet the requirements because of unforeseen circumstances. It is not intended to provide a long term or a generally applicable de-facto reduction from the 50 per cent of total factory cost requirement to 48 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the legislation to allow manufactured materials sourced wholly within a qualifying area to be included in the allowable expenditure on materials. The omission of this facility was an unintended oversight when the rules or origin legislation was put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill makes minor technical amendments to the provision requiring artificial elements of cost to be disregarded. The provision will now relate to preference claim goods rather than materials. It will allow the cost of material to be disregarded, where they are added or attached to the preference claim goods solely for the purpose of artificially raising the allowable factory cost of the goods. The revised legislation will more accurately reflect the 1992 CER agreement on this aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except for the new provision on inland freight for Forum Island Countries, the rules of origin provisions will apply from 1 April 1994. The inland freight provision will be implemented from Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the above two major policy initiatives, the bill also proposes amendments to:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRADE MARKS BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Marks Bill 1995 is the result of an extensive review of Australia's trade marks legislation that takes into account the significant public comment made on the proposed reforms and draft legislation. As well as repealing the Trade Marks Act 1955, it will repeal and replace the Trade Marks Act 1994, which has not yet come into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should imagine that many honourable senators are wondering why the Government is proposing to repeal and replace legislation that has only recently been enacted. Let me briefly explain. To enable Australia to accept the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, legislation that met Australia's obligations relating to trade marks under the WTO Agreement needed to be enacted. Rather than amend the existing Trade Marks Act 1955 to meet those obligations, the Government felt that the most expedient approach would be to introduce into the Parliament the Trade Marks Bill 1994, which had been released as an exposure draft early in 1994 and was essentially WTO-consistent. However, the Government was acutely aware of the signals that this course of action might send because it would preclude the 1994 bill from reflecting the results of public comment that had been sought on the exposure draft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the 1994 bill was introduced, the Government took the opportunity to reiterate its publicly stated commitment to take into account public comment by introducing at the earliest opportunity appropriate amending legislation. I emphasise that this Government has always been genuine in its commitment to take into account the views of interested parties and this is reflected in this bill. However, because of the extensive nature of the changes that would be required to be made to the Trade Marks Act 1994, the Government has decided that it would be simpler and more convenient for users of the trade marks system to repeal the 1994 Act and replace it with consolidated legislation that users would find more accessible and comprehensible. The bill currently before the Senate does this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A trade mark serves to indicate the trade origin of goods or services. By granting the owner of a registered trade mark the exclusive right to use, or authorise others to use, their trade mark, Australia's trade marks law serves two complementary objectives&mdash;first, identification and protection of a business's products and, second, protection of the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the first objective, the value of a trade mark to its owner can be enormous in terms of the reputation and goodwill associated with the trade mark. For example, in its 1994 annual report, Pacific Dunlop valued its brands, including trade marks, at $319 million. Clearly, a registered trade mark, properly managed, can become a valuable asset of a business, an asset that can be sold, franchised out, licensed or used as security. As such, adequate protection of trade marks and other valuable intellectual property is vital for all innovative Australian enterprises. As part of its reforms to encourage innovation in Australian businesses, the Government has sought to improve the overall efficiency of Australia's trade mark registration system and to meet the contemporary and future needs of Australian business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the second objective, trade marks also provide certainty to consumers by indicating the trade source of goods or services. Through use, consumers can also come to associate a trade mark with the quality of a particular good or service. For example, referring again to the Pacific Dunlop products, the "Chesty Bond" singlet has become an Australian icon because of people's experience over many years with that particular product. Because consumers make purchasing decisions based on the trade marks associated with goods or services, trade marks legislation, as well as trade practices and related legislation, provide appropriate checks and balances to ensure that use of trade marks do not deceive or confuse consumers. Quite obviously, trade marks are a vital link between the owner of the trade mark, the owner's products, and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australian firms become more export-oriented, in an increasingly globalised marketplace, this link is, perhaps, even more important. International developments relating to trade marks, such as the recently concluded WTO Agreement and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Trademark Law Treaty, reinforce the significant role that trade marks play in international trade. Against this international backdrop, several countries, including New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and South Africa, have recently undertaken major reviews of their national trade marks law. The Government has had due regard to these developments and has sought to harmonise Australia's trade marks system, as far as practicable, with similar systems of other industrialised countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Commonwealth first legislated on trade mark matters in 1905, there have been two other significant reviews. They occurred in 1938 and 1954, and resulted in the current Trade Marks Act 1955. In many respects this bill represents an evolution from, rather than a revolutionary change of, the 1955 Act. It refines and streamlines the current trade marks system, and updates it to reflect recent international developments. The bill implements Australia's obligations under the WTO Agreement, but its main thrust is to implement the Government's response to the July 1992 report, Recommended Changes to the Australian Trade Marks Legislation, as modified by the consultation process I have already mentioned. That report was prepared by the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation which comprised representatives from the legal and patent attorney professions, industry and government. It was asked initially to review and streamline the trade marks legislation, but as the work progressed its objectives expanded to take into account the international developments already described.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Working Party made 57 recommendations for change to Australia's trade marks system. Except for three recommendations, relating to the so-called "association" of trade marks and the structure of the Trade Marks Register, the Working Party's recommendations were unanimous. The Government accepted those unanimous recommendations. In regard to those recommendations on which the Working Party could not agree, the Government decided that it would accept the minority recommendations of the Working Party in the interests of harmonising the law with international trends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill currently before the Senate is, in many respects, the same as the Trade Marks Act 1994. I will briefly outline some of the more noteworthy features of the trade marks system that have been carried over from the 1994 Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the review which produced the 1955 Act the Trade Marks Register was divided, mainly it would seem to conform with the British legislation then in force and to provide for registration of certain trade marks, in Part B, for which the rights given by registration would be limited. Unlike the 1955 Act, the bill does not divide the Trade Marks Register. Under the WTO Agreement there is no distinction between trade marks with respect to the rights they acquire on registration, rather they are to be afforded a level of protection equivalent to that of current Part A registration. Despite a minority of submissions expressing concern about the Register being undivided, the Government remains convinced that the undivided Register proposed in the bill will increase the efficiency of the registration process without adversely affecting the rights of trade mark owners. An undivided Register will also harmonise Australia's trade marks law with those of other OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is expressed in terms that make it clear that there is to be a presumption of registrability when an application for registration is being examined by the Registrar of Trade Marks. This means that if there is any doubt about whether a trade mark should be registered, that doubt will be resolved in favour of the applicant, rather than against the applicant as is now the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill widens the test available for infringement of a registered trade mark. In particular, action for infringement of a trade mark will be possible when the trade mark is used without the owner's authority in association with goods or services similar to those in respect of which the trade mark is registered. At present, infringement proceedings may only be brought where the trade mark has been used without authority in association with the same goods or services for which the trade mark is registered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new, broader definition of what may constitute a trade mark is introduced by the bill. As a result, it will now be possible to register sounds, smells and aspects of packaging as trade marks, provided that all the other requirements for registrability are met. This change is responsive to the contemporary and developing marketing needs of business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also streamlines existing procedures under the trade marks system. The bill introduces multi-class applications, which will obviate the need to file separate applications for each class of goods or services for which registration is sought; simplified provisions for recording the assignment of trade marks; and a more streamlined method for removing unused trade marks from the Trade Marks Register. These changes will benefit users of the trade marks system through the introduction of simpler procedures that eliminate unnecessary steps, improved efficiency in the Trade Marks Office and being in tune with the realities of modern marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this bill differs from the 1994 Act mostly in matters of clarity and technical detail, there are three changes that deserve specific mention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, a number of submissions on the exposure draft of the 1994 bill addressed the Government's proposals for streamlining the provisions relating to the "association" of trade marks. A business's trade marks are considered "associated" when they are substantially identical or deceptively similar and are used in relation to similar goods or services. The 1955 Act requires that associated trade marks be identified as such and prohibits a bundle of associated trade marks from being split up and assigned to different people. After considering this issue further the Government has decided that it would be better to do away altogether with the concept of associated trade marks rather than retain the scheme set out in the Trade Marks Act 1994. This is in line with views expressed in submissions and is consistent with the situation in most other industrialised nations. Should a change in ownership of a trade mark result in deception or confusion, the validity of the registration of the trade mark may be challenged under other provisions of the bill which could result in the trade mark being deregistered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, the bill does not include provisions relating to registration of the use of a trade mark by a person other than the trade mark owner. The bill provides that where owners of trade marks exercise control over use of their trade marks by other persons, that use can be taken to be use by the owner. This is prescribed by the WTO Agreement and can be used by trade mark owners to defend an action to deregister their trade mark on the basis that they have not used it. The WTO Agreement does not require use under the control of the owner of the trade mark to be registered. Consequently, there is little benefit in retaining additional provisions for the registration of users. This change will simplify the new trade marks legislation significantly. Recent developments in Canada and the UK are consistent with this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, the bill carries over the significantly increased penalties for counterfeiting and forging of trade marks introduced in 1992. Consistent with current criminal law policy, the bill also applies the fault element of knowledge or recklessness to these offences, rather than strict liability or the test of "ought reasonably to have known".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with modern legislative drafting practice, the bill sets out the guiding principles and general framework of the new trade marks system, with much of the detail devolved to the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new legislation will come into force on 1 January 1996. This will allow time for the significant administrative and other changes required as a result of the legislation to be made by users of the trade marks system and the Trade Marks Office, and enable interested parties to become more familiar with the legislation in its final form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the review of Australia's trade marks legislation that has resulted in the bill currently before the Senate, the Government has been committed to extensive public consultation with a view to having in place the best possible registered trade marks system for Australian industry. We have placed great emphasis on getting the legislation right. Consequently, there have been extensive opportunities for public comment on the Working Party's reports and the exposure drafts of the bill and subordinate regulations and I believe that people have welcomed the opportunity to be able to contribute. Significantly, 35 public information seminars were held around Australia to explain the draft bill and its expected impact, and to receive direct feedback on the draft bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Receiving comments on the draft bill and regulations has been particularly helpful to the Government in developing and refining the reforms to the trade marks system, as well as improving the specific structure and wording of the legislation itself. Mr President, I would sincerely like to thank all those organisations and individuals who have contributed to this review, especially the Law Council of Australia, the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia, the Australian Manufacturers' Patents, Industrial Designs, Copyright &amp; Trade Mark Association (AMPICTA) and, in particular, the individuals concerned, for giving their time and for their devotion to the job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of this new trade marks legislation requires revision of existing practices and procedures in the Trade Marks Office, as well as major changes to the comparatively large and complex Office computer system. The estimated cost to the Trade Marks Office, which is part of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation (AIPO), of the one-off implementation activity is estimated to be in the order of $4 million. This includes the modifications to the computer system and the training of Trade Marks Office staff with respect to the new practices and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIPO is required to recover all its costs from its fees and charges. AIPO operates on a Group 2 Trust Account arrangement and is committed to containing costs for normal operations to within inflation and to achieving productivity gains at least equal to the efficiency dividend required for the Australian Public Service. The one-off costs of implementing the new trade marks system are budgeted for the next two years. Offsetting the one-off implementation costs will be benefits to the owners and users of trade marks in having a modern trade mark registration system that conforms with Australia's international commitments and is harmonised, as far as practicable, with similar systems of other OECD countries. In the longer term, there will be savings to the Trade Marks Office in the administration of a more streamlined system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been nearly 40 years since the current trade marks legislation came into force; I believe that the bill now before the Senate is a worthy successor and one that will serve and protect the interests of trade mark owners and the public well into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we broke for lunch, we were discussing the Taxation Laws Amendment (Drought Relief Measures) Bill 1995. The bill is to take effect on 1 July. The government brought it forward with the idea that it may help people in the present drought situation. It does not help people in this drought season whatsoever. It may help people in a future drought, but not in the drought that we have at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures that this bill allows&mdash;deductibility of items such as direct drilling implements and drought bonds&mdash;will affect farmers where they have got some funds coming through. As I said before lunch, the ones that are affected by drought will not be in a position to take advantage of this&mdash;I must say&mdash;very small measure, which I will address a bit later on. They will not be able to take advantage of the measure until they get into a profitable situation again, which probably will not be until two years down the track. Those badly affected by drought will not have a farm income this year, and losses will be carried forward to next year. I would say that it will be two years before any of these benefits flow through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let no-one be fooled by this bill. It does not help people in this season whatsoever, even though the government likes to think that it does. The people affected by the drought will not be able to put money into drought bonds. In the short time I have got left, I will address the areas in the bill that allow income deductions for tax purposes. As I say, this will only affect the future seasons. The bill addresses fodder storage facilities for buildings or silos, and facilities to improve water storage, such as earth tanks, underground tanks or above ground tanks. It would be good to get some sort of deductibility, or extra deductibility, for those items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill says that capital expenditure on water tankers is not eligible. Why not? If you set up improved water storage or on-farm storage through dams, or put windmills on bores, then the water has got to be transported somehow. It may not always be able to be transported by water pipes or rising mains out of a pump. In some cases, it would have to be transported by water tankers. As you would probably know, Mr Acting Deputy President, water tankers are not an all-purpose vehicle. Most water tankers that I know of can move water, and that is about all. They cannot move fuel, otherwise you would have contaminated water. Those sorts of things will be eligible, except for water tankers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get the allowance to build water storages, such as dams or water catchments, you must have in writing from an Office of Water Conservation agency or an approved farm water resource consultant a total farm plan of water catchment. I will get back to that. This bill, which shows how generous the government is to the farmers of Australia, allows for a maximum total expenditure of $50,000. That gives a maximum deductible item of $5,000&mdash;that is all. If anyone can work out a better figure than that, I invite them to tell me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to what I was saying about the farm plan that you must have. What sort of total farm plan for water catchment can you get for under $5,000? Or was this provision made to simply give a few jobs to some neo-greenie groups that may be qualified in that area? I can tell you that, rather than have one of those eco-nuts come along to my property, I would forgo that $5,000, if it were available. But it is not available. You have got to spend more than $5,000 on your farm plan so that you qualify to receive a maximum of $5,000 from deductions. That is the catch. I can tell you that there will not be too many who will do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package is nowhere near as generous as the government would like to think it is. I had a press release from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) telling us how good this package is. I want to point out to the farmers of Australia that they should look before they leap. When they are thinking of spending extra money on a deductible item, they should remember that the deduction they are entitled to is, effectively, a maximum of only $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to minimum tillage equipment. The bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equipment is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">minimum tillage equipment</EMPHASIS> if it is for use in planting or cultivation and involves:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) no tillage of the soil; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) tillage of the soil that does not seriously affect soil structure and that retains a high degree of organic matter or surface cover.</PARA>
<PARA>I defy anyone to come to a suitable conclusion from that definition. If you have any tillage at all, it is tillage. I would like a better definition than that. Bearing in mind the $50,000 maximum expenditure allowable to get that $5,000, I do not know of any minimum tillage equipment that you can buy for under $30,000. That is minimum size. If you go to a reasonable size which can be pulled by a normal four-wheel drive tractor on a property these days, it is $1,000; for metricated people, it is $330 per metre. So you would be looking at $50,000. That is just for the bar; it does not include the seeding equipment that goes onto it. The seeding equipment would take you up to at least $120,000 to $130,000. I ask: where is the generosity of this government? It is not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to address the issue of the drought management bonds. I believe they are an effective tool in farming and as one who is very involved in farming I can recommend them. The allowable interest rate on the drought bonds will rise from 80 to 100 per cent. I believe that that is a commonsense approach. The government is showing generosity again by increasing the maximum amount each farmer can have in a farm management bond from $80,000 to $150,000. The government is taking away the withholding tax component on withdrawals. I believe that is a very good move and it is something that the farmers, through their peak bodies, have been lobbying for for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go back to that figure of $150,000. That is the amount farmers can have&mdash;not to spend now but to drought proof their farm&mdash;in a management bond for when the next drought comes around. How far will $150,000 go towards planting a new crop or restocking after a massive drought like that experienced in New South Wales last year and which is continuing this year? I can tell you that, from my experience, it will not go very far. We have just gone through a drought and farmers will not have the money available to put into these drought bonds. If we get a few good seasons and farmers are able to build up that $150,000 it will not go very far if we have another drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that each farmer should have enough money in a drought bond to cover costs. Farmers are building up the money in those bonds themselves. They are not asking the government to build up that $150,000, they have to save that money themselves. I believe a good management tool for a farm that is run properly is that it should be free from asking the government or the banks for help to carry on. In areas where drought is a one-off, I believe farmers should at least have enough money to plant a crop for the next year. Farmers will never be drought free. They expect a drought every five years, every seven years or every 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My good friend Senator Tierney has told us how bad things have been in the Upper Hunter Valley for the last two, three and four years. I believe in those areas where you are likely to cop two or three droughts in a row&mdash;and this is the principle that my farm management works on&mdash;you should have enough money stored away, not to use for just anything, to carry on for two years in case something goes wrong and then you do not have to rely on the banks or the government. That amounts to a lot more than $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe average farmers on average size farms where they get droughts should have at least $200,000 to $250,000 each year put away. This will enable them to carry on and to plant a crop. That is not to do anything else like changing plant or financing children in tertiary studies. To be completely independent of the government you would have to work at a figure somewhere in that range. If they are looking at having money to carry on for two years in case they cop droughts two years in a row then I believe they should have around half a million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not giving away anything. The bonds will be taxed in time. The money that goes into drought bonds is tax free, but when the money comes out or the farmer sells out it will be taxed. They cannot carry drought bonds when they sell out. Those drought bonds will be taxed as normal income. That is the figure the government has to work towards. Certainly, when we are in government we will work to get the figure to $500,000 per farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the bill even though it is a small measure. It is certainly no measure at all to the people who are in drought. The ones that have had a reasonable season, like those in Western Australia, can start building their drought bonds up from $80,000 to $150,000. We welcome the investment allowance, small as it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the measures announced last December in the $112 million drought assistance program which is aimed at helping farmers cope with drought in the long term. The package basically included two aspects. One was the five-year, 10 per cent taxation allowance for capital expenditure of up to $50,000 a year per taxpayer on livestock, water and fodder storage facilities, water transport facilities and minimum tillage equipment. The second was the enhancement of the farm management bond scheme and IEDs, with the investment component being raised to 100 per cent and a new maximum limit on deposits of $150,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It always seems to me that these important agricultural matters are left to the 11th hour when we do not have enough time to debate them. The other aspect of this particular legislation is that there is nothing in it, as my good friend Senator Panizza said, for the present drought affected farmers. We are entering, certainly in the north-west of New South Wales and the south-west of Queensland, our fifth year of drought and our fifth winter of drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement yesterday by the New South Wales government that the drought declarations for April indicated seven areas slipping back into drought shows how serious the problem is. The announcement yesterday shows that two other rural land protection boards in New South Wales were removed from the list, resulting in the percentage of the state that is drought declared rising again from 58 per cent in March to 60 per cent in April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the rain in January, which gave a lot of people, especially in the north-west of New South Wales, some hope, almost two-thirds of the state remains in drought at this time. Unfortunately, some areas of the state which had previously shown signs of recovery, including parts of the Armidale, New England, Bathurst, Bega, Carcoar, Dubbo, Glen Innes, Holbrook, Inverell, Molong and Yass rural land protection boards, have been retrospectively declared in drought from 1 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A critical situation certainly exists now. In terms of the sort of problems that rural Australia faces, we are really looking at the situation of, more than ever, developing two Australias&mdash;rural and regional Australia and metropolitan Australia. To a certain extent, they are possibly getting some positive benefits from the five minutes of economic sunlight that we presently have. We are told that manufacturing exports are doing well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> yesterday that the steel division of BHP has made record profits. Hopefully, those record profits will continue even though today's current account deficit was again over $2 billion. We are seeing the sort of unique qualities of rural Australia, the sort of qualities that make up our psyche and the way we think about ourselves. The sort of society that we have developed in regional and rural Australia over a century is changing and changing irreparably. Young people in rural Australia really see no future, even if they have nothing to do with farming, in making a career in agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inexplicable in a nation as rich as Australia that this is happening. It is inexplicable when you consider that the fabric, development and infrastructure of rural Australia were built on agriculture and it is suffering terribly at the moment. It is suffering because, even in the best of times, there is very little money in running a farm. I can tell you that, with the sorts of pressures farmers are working under now, there is very little hope for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear all sorts of anecdotal stories&mdash;and they have to be anecdotal to hide people's identity&mdash;about what is happening when the bank statement arrives, and the stories are absolutely true. People are desperate, and they are taking desperate measures with their lives and their families' lives. It is very sad. It is sad for those of us who live on the western side of the range to be involved with and try to represent those people in the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a couple of points about two aspects of the legislation. The first aspect is the qualification for exceptional circumstances. When is an area in exceptional circumstances and when is it not? The government has moved the goalposts a couple of times as to when an area qualifies for exceptional circumstances help but, at the end of the day, it is very arbitrary. We have heard from Senator Tierney&mdash;both today and before&mdash;about the Upper Hunter, a normally abundant area of New South Wales not used to drought. The question of drought or severe drought has to be approached differently in the Upper Hunter than in other areas which are not so used to good rainfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s the situation was addressed by what I believe was a more practical rural adjustment scheme. It was a depression type scheme where local advisory boards determined which areas would qualify for rural assistance. There was supervision by local practising farmers, and those supervisory boards had the ability to address questions of bank debt and whether farmers should be helped off the land. They helped some farmers to buy more land, and they certainly helped to keep food on the table. I think it was a much more practical approach to drought aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the government's move down the road to a more scientific approach of determining exceptional circumstances, I do not care what approach the government takes. It does not matter how the government targets help and assistance, but that is what the government is there to do and it must be done. I know that there are certain areas in New South Wales which would certainly qualify for exceptional circumstances, but that has not happened lately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) is the way the drought investment allowance works. The general investment allowance which applied to farmers should never have been removed. We are looking at a situation now where the 10 per cent investment allowance is being reintroduced for specific water and fodder conservation. It is something that is beneficial, but it is only marginally beneficial because very few farmers&mdash;especially those in drought affected areas&mdash;would have the sort of cash that would make it possible for them to be in a position to invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It always seems to me rather strange that, in a nation that is as dependent on water as Australia, water conservation is not tax deductible in the year of expenditure. It is presently tax deductible over three years, which seems ridiculous. The only way to encourage people to invest in water conservation is to make it tax deductible and give them the investment allowance as well. That would be very advantageous to people. If the government gives up the revenue when allowing deductions over three years, why not allow the deduction over one year for a start? The government has already given up the fact that it is going to give that cash to the farmers. It should give it up at the time that gives flexibility to the farmers or the small businessmen to make a decision when it is appropriate to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of Senator Panizza's comments about the value of this investment allowance, there is value only if a farmer has the capacity to pay. I can tell you, from personal experience and from information from people I know in farming at the moment, that there is no way in the world farmers have any money for capital expenditure, regardless of the encouragement of the investment allowance on water and especially stockfeed storage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way the government can encourage these sorts of things is by tax concessions, but it must make them real, make the infrastructure that is appropriate to fodder conservation tax deductible and certainly leave the investment allowance in place. I am not looking a gift horse in the mouth because any help that farmers get is something that I applaud, but the practical advantage of this legislation is pretty small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final aspect is the operation of the farm management bonds and the IEDs. The IED scheme was introduced in the late 1970s. It was very advantageous in terms of making plans for an economic downturn. Again, the government is not giving up the eventual taxability of the income that is raised; it just provides an avenue for farmers to put something away for a dry day and be in a position to help themselves. I think farmers at the end of the day want that capacity. They do not want handouts. They wish to be able to control their economic circumstances as best they might. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a couple of things about the operation of the IEDs and farm management bonds. The first is that IEDs are not available to proprietary companies. The minister wrote to me and said to me privately that not a great number of farming operations in Australia were proprietary companies&mdash;I think he said about eight per cent. He said that, in terms of the way the process operated, the government felt that the availability of IEDs to proprietary companies would provide some access for tax avoidance that might be unsatisfactory and get out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say from my own point of view that the old scheme of IEDs was available to proprietary companies. I am from a small family pastoral company. It was very helpful to me and, without going into the details of the 1982-83 drought, I was able to come out of it, having put money aside previously, with my debt structure exactly the same as it was when I went into it. Between 1983 and 1992, when the drought in my area started again, I was not able to put anything away because of high interest rates, reasonably low commodity prices, the collapse in wool, certainly, and not very good seasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason I have not put anything away is that my accountant told me that it was of no value at all under the present scheme. That is not to say that I would not use a scheme that was properly set up and available to me as a primary producer to put cash in when times turn around&mdash;which hopefully they will. I ask the government to reconsider the possibility that small proprietary companies might access IEDs. My learned colleague Senator Watson, who has a very good understanding of the accountancy profession, understands that they are of value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I would like the government to consider is what Senator Panizza said: $150,000 does sound a lot to the man in the street as to the sort of money that could be put aside for difficult times in farming. But farming today is very capital intensive. You are dealing with very large costs. You have very large borrowings in the main and, of course, the debt that is overhanging rural Australia at the moment is absolutely unsustainable. That is something that this government will have to address&mdash;and when we are in government we will have to address&mdash;to look at some way of handling the level of debt that farming is presently labouring under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the capacity to plan for the future, $150,000 is generally not enough for farmers to have. It does not provide the sort of assistance needed by small family farming companies, which are not as uncommon as the minister indicated to me. As I said, they probably make up eight or 10 per cent of farming operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support these measures. It is interesting that a lot of the advantages and practical help that the farming community had before 1983 have been systematically taken away. This is a real recognition that the help that was provided, especially with IEDs, was absolutely essential. It is interesting that IEDs are now being reintroduced. I think that is pretty indicative of a government that is very uncountry and very unsympathetic to country people and their concerns. To be political, you only have to look at the New South Wales result to see that the National Party's vote in the north, the west and the central part of New South Wales held up very well because people in those areas are very concerned about the sorts of things that the National Party is concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor does not have people who come from the western side of the range. That does not just apply in New South Wales. Labor is not sympathetic to country people and country concerns. We must have measures introduced that provide farmers and rural communities with a capacity to survive. One thing that is very clear, unfortunately, is that they are not going to get that sort of help from a government that is headed by a Prime Minister who has the audacity to say that this has been the best year since the war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Watson, I understand this is further to the question asked by Senator Harradine about the meaning of `incurred'. This bill does not deal with the timing of deductions, nor does it change the meaning of the word `incurred'. It uses exactly the same words as the current legislation. As indicated earlier, if, contrary to the drafter's intention, this bill results in a change on this point, we will correct the position. So the clear understanding is that there is no change to the meaning of `incurred'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator, you specifically asked about whether an expense is deductible once a liability arises or only when it is paid. Your question related to a medical practitioner. As indicated earlier, for a medical practitioner, or indeed for any income which is returned on an accrual basis, the answer is beyond doubt. You can deduct the expense once you have a presently existing liability. However, the position for expenses which are related to income which is only included in assessable income once the income is received, known as cash basis income, is not so clear. It is commonly understood, and there is some judicial authority for the position, that in some cases the deduction has only been incurred and is only deductible once it has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the English case of Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Morrison, Lord Clyde said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two alternative modes of computation are known as the `cash' basis mode and the `earnings' basis mode. According to the first, the profits of the business are estimated according to the excess of the actual cash receipts during the year over the cash outlays and expenses actually disbursed or paid during the year.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decided last year in case 49/94 94 ATC 429 that a deduction was not available for telephone expenses relating to a bill paid on 4 July, after the relevant year of income, as the applicant had been taxed on a cash rather than an accrual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in contrast to this position, it is also argued that `incurred' does not have a different meaning in this context and that such expenses can be claimed earlier; namely, when the liability arises. This issue is currently being looked at by the tax law improvement team responsible for rewriting the general deduction provisions, including section 51(1). Any changes will be likely to be before the parliament in November, but I am not in a position to say what, if any, changes will be made on this point. </PARA>

My understanding has always been that section 51, which is the general deduction section, stands alone, irrespective of whether a person is in business or a professional person, or whether they return their income on a cash or accrual basis. However, I do acknowledge that there are certain circumstances in which the ability of various classes of people&mdash;particularly, for example, certain employees&mdash;to claim work expenses on an incurred basis may be restricted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I also use this opportunity of requesting that the government, when it does rewrite section 51, takes cognisance of the fact that nowadays most income streams are subject to tax either on account of income or on account of capital gains. One of the reasons why Australian companies, for example, have a higher exposure to income tax than other companies around the world is the fact that Australian law denies quite a significant range of expenditure, particularly start-up type expenditure and certain environmental expenditure, deductibility on either the capital or current account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 51, which is the general deduction section, was drawn up at a time before we had capital gains, so we do not appear to have a complementary section 51 which was drawn up in the environment of a tax on income regime, as applied to a regime for capital gains.

<PARA>I guess it has been written in plain English from the kind of wording that existed in section 262A under the current Income Tax Assessment Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I noted in my speech during the second reading debate, we are putting up this amendment to put business and ordinary taxpayers on a more equal footing. It was only recently that the requirement for taxpayers to hold onto receipts was reduced to 3 1/2 years. The idea now is to extend the requirement for wage and salary earners to hang on to their receipts for five years. I disagree with cutting the time business has to save its documentation to five years. This equalisation goes in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wage earners move and many of them rent houses. It is not uncommon for them to lose receipts. It is not uncommon for them not to know that they have to save receipts or for how long they must save them. Most taxpayers are not cheats. Those who are will usually cheat each year. If a computer throws up a name as questionable and that person's last tax year is audited and found okay, it is more likely that their claim of two, three or five years ago was okay even if they do not have their receipts any more. It is unlikely that they have cheated a few years back, destroyed their receipts and now behave as angels as cover. This is the assumption of the tax office&mdash;an assumption that is being built into tax law with this legislation. It is a sort of guilty until proven innocent system and it is up to the taxpayer to prove that they are innocent for many years to come, unfortunately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we see the case where all sorts of things are required of documents that are simply not provided on real documents really received in the real world. We do not ask this of business. The tax office accepts that normal documents in the form normally received are either good enough or not good enough to substantiate claims. The Australian Taxation Office does not require additional information on special forms not normally provided by sellers and will accept normal ordinary items, such as cancelled cheques and so on, for the purpose of substantiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normal PAYE taxpayers, if they make claims, will have an idea that they have to substantiate the claims. But, realistically, how many will know that ordinary receipts, cancelled cheques and so on that would be standard accounting records, are good enough to substantiate business claims but are not good enough to substantiate the claims of potential horrible tax-cheating PAYE workers? How many will know the hoops they need to jump through to make it acceptable? Why is it that the letter of the law makes rationality and sanity disappear unless the ATO decides to use its discretion to ignore the law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in the Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill no move to substantially improve tax law; it is just rewriting it to make the bad laws crystal clear. Yet we see an extension of the period which this bad substantiation law applies to ordinary PAYE workers. It is wrong. If our amendments are not accepted, we will not be able to support the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned before that our preference with taxation is that we ought to be reviewing our taxation system. The report the ACTU produced and then did not publish last year clearly said that our current tax system is aiding the growing gap between rich and poor in Australia. We would strongly support the review of our tax laws in Australia. But if we are simply clarifying the English of a very flawed law, and a law that not only creates a greater tax burden in reality for the people on the lower end of the scale but also requires them to substantiate it for years after, all we are doing is making it even tougher for us to then argue that we ought to look at the tax system again. Someone will say, `We spent all this time in 1995 and 1996 rewriting the tax law. Now you want to look at it again?' The answer is yes. We ought to be looking at the tax system in terms of its fairness, its ability to be implemented and its actual impact on the average person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in this bill no move to substantially improve tax law; it is just rewriting it to make the bad laws crystal clear. Our amendment is simple: it eliminates the plain language requirement for documentation that is unlikely to be obtained by taxpayers from ordinary sellers in ordinary business. It uses the words from section 262A(2) to substitute the substantiation requirements business must meet. This seems a fair approach to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Accountants Association, which has lobbied heavily for real reform, is delighted with the proposed change. We feel it is the minimum that should be done to eliminate the worst aspects of unreasonable compliance requirements for ordinary people. We had some examples given by the parliamentary secretary when he was in the duty minister's position earlier. He said that this will mean that there will be unsubstantiated areas. He gave an example of the air trip which we keep talking about. This is a very famous air trip by now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reality is that substantiation would still be required. Nothing in section 262A says that people do not have to substantiate claims. If there were such a flawed way of substantiating claims, why is it that it is suitable to substantiate the claims of business? Where is this flaw in relation to business that is so gross in relation to ordinary taxpayers? If section 262A is a means by which business can avoid  substantiating claims, or can falsify records or can do something that the average taxpayer cannot avoid doing, then there must be something wrong with that and perhaps we ought to address that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that that is okay for business or that the tax office does not have the ability to consider whether documents used for substantiation are suitable to substantiate a claim and to make that decision creates a problem. Once again it is throwing back that blame onto the individual and that is the wrong way to go. We may well be saving money, supposedly, in the number of personnel who are required to administer the tax act&mdash;I am not sure what the personnel numbers are now&mdash;but we are leaving a whole lot of people terrorised at the possibility that they may have self-assessed incorrectly. There is a fair bet that that will impact on what people are prepared to claim, even if they are legitimate claims. This is and could well be interpreted by a reasonable person as a backdoor way of reducing people's legitimate claims and saving money in terms of legitimate tax rebates for the ordinary taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment does not support tax cheats. The onus of proof still remains on the taxpayers, who must substantiate their claims. It eliminates the requirement for documentation of sorts and in forms which are not normally received. Documentation still must be produced, but ordinary documentation&mdash;any documentation that supports the claim&mdash;becomes permissible. We feel that with this amendment this bill actually has some power to improve tax regulations and to make them much more rational. Ordinary taxpayers are certain to find that a welcome relief. Without it, it leaves the taxpayer in a worse situation with increased time for prosecution if unreasonable demands are not met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is the vanguard of what we will see in a larger tax bill which deals with other aspects, then it would appear to have a certain attraction. Yes, it simplifies the language. But if this is the general principle, that self-assessment becomes more of the norm in the administration, and the possibility of computer-based auditing becomes more and more a part of our society, then I do not know whether it is the kind of society that I would like to live in. We have to look at the implications for ordinary Australians and whether or not the client&mdash;that is, the average taxpayer&mdash;will like this and feel that it is fair when it is presented to them as a fait accompli. </PARA>

If we were to accept documents which permit estimates, for example, for work related expenses, then the Senate would completely change the whole concept of substantiation.

Senator Margetts might recall that I had some particular problems with those original provisions. In fact, I think there is still a section there&mdash;the genesis of which came from my private member's bill. The Senate should note that that section has not been changed as a result of these substantiation requirements. In fact, it is still a central feature. But acceptance of a concept of documents that provide an estimate that are suitable to satisfy the substantiation requirements will effectively wipe out and negate what has been intended by this particular bill. </PARA>

Most of us would have left this place very early in our lives if we required 100 per cent acceptance of all our ideas. This place is a great forum for compromise, for the floating of ideas. I hope that in future the remarks will be less politically targeted and made at a time after the party has time to consider all the relevant issues&mdash;that time being, I believe, at the conclusion of this particular debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments were directed at the requirements under section 262A which involve the keeping of records. They involve sections 262A(1),(2),(3), (4), (4)A and 5. Senator Margetts has drawn from only part of those subsections and then only a portion of subsection (2). That, however, is not the main thrust of my criticism. My main criticism for rejecting the amendment is the emphasis that this shorthand version of section 262A(2) puts on the word `estimate'&mdash;`documents relating to an estimate or a determination of a calculation'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA Greens are applying that business concept to work related expenses, but in the context of a business, section 262A(2) is directed towards, for example, estimating the life of assets. One opinion might be that they will last for 20 years; another opinion could be 10 years. So the business has to keep documents which show the estimated life according to some engineering criteria or how long the plant is going to work those particular assets&mdash;say, a one, two or three shift operation which can have great relevance to the estimate of the working life. The claim for depreciation is then determined. The focus, however, that I believe is implied as a result of this wording by use of the word `estimate' is that all a taxpayer has to do is to estimate his work expenses. This is a different context in which section 262A is worded if you read section 262A as a whole. </PARA>

In that process there is a degree of unhappiness which has been expressed during the very long debate today. Some of those concerns hopefully will be further addressed when the task force rewrites section 51, particularly if the tax office and the government are good enough to take up the concerns that I have raised in this debate today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps we might move some way towards a resolution, if a resolution is possible. In reality it would be difficult to expect any PAYE taxpayer to keep all records. It would be a total nightmare and a huge cost for society if we kept records of everything and if there might be a consequence for not keeping all records of everything. Maybe the wording is that a person wishing to make deductions must keep all relevant records of those proposed deductions or whatever. We understand that for a person running a business it is normal accounting procedure to keep records. But what you are saying concerns me&mdash;that perhaps the government would like to see PAYE tax become exactly like business tax and that it is fair and equitable to treat PAYE taxpayers in exactly the same way as business is treated, when in reality people are not there to make money, they are there just to earning a living and do the normal things people do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened for some time as the issue has been debated across the end of the chamber between representatives of the various parties. Senator Watson has shown a pretty good grasp of this issue. On the general issues being raised by Senator Margetts, we want to put on the record the government's attitude to her suggestions and amendments. She asserts that the requirement of keeping records on salary and wage earners is more onerous than it is for business. This is nonsense. Senator Margetts has quoted from section 262(2)A1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, apparently without appreciating its significance. That subsection sets out the basic record-keeping requirements for business. It requires a person carrying on business to keep records that record and explain all transactions and other acts engaged in by the person that are relevant for any purpose of the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very comprehensive obligation&mdash;far more comprehensive than for ordinary taxpayers&mdash;and recognises that businesses, as a matter of course, need to keep detailed and adequate records as a matter of good business practice. That is quite different from the limited record-keeping requirements that the bill will impose on salary and wage earners in respect of some but not all of their claims for deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts also appears not to understand the importance to taxpayers of the specific written evidence requirements contained in the substantiation rules. Under this bill and the existing law, taxpayers know what evidence will be accepted by the commissioner as a matter of course and without argument as to adequacy. That is very important because it gives taxpayers the certainty they need to be able to conclude their tax affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government recognises that it is not possible to comprehensibly prescribe an absolute rule that will cover all situations. The government understands that suppliers do not alway give taxpayers adequate receipts. The government understands that documents are sometimes lost. That is why the government amended the substantiation provisions in 1991: to give the commissioner discretion to look at other evidence to establish that an expense has been incurred and is deductible. The government is further amending that discretion by this bill to remove any restriction on taxpayers accessing that discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts wants to remove that first limb of the substantiation rules so that taxpayers and the commissioner of taxation will have no clear statement of what evidence should be accepted without challenge to its adequacy. The Greens would get no thanks from Australian taxpayers for that change if it were carried. Taxpayers would be thrown into using their own resources to establish the adequacy of their evidence. No doubt the commissioner would be required to issue rulings about what evidence would be accepted without challenge. I suspect they would be in the same terms as the requirements in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts should realise also that by converting very clear evidentiary rules to fuzzy law statements greater reliance is thrown on the courts to interpret the rules. Going to tribunals and courts is an expensive matter. It would no doubt be welcomed in spades by the legal profession, but I do not think it would be welcome by the rest of us Australians as it would serve to only increase taxpayer compliance costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to section 4-4. This relates to the five-year period for the retention of records. This time period does tend to favour the taxpayer who lodges late as opposed to a taxpayer who lodges his return earlier. I am concerned about the fairness or logic of such a concession going to taxpayers who have an ability to delay the lodgement of their return as compared with a taxpayer who lodges before or on time for that particular status of taxpayer. It may be that a more suitable time is one month after the end of the financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can the minister explain the rationale behind this particular provision that favours a person in terms of late lodging, in relation to a particular year as opposed to an earlier lodger? It refers to the date of lodgment rather than, say, the end of a relevant particular financial year. To me, that seems just a little inequitable. The five years starts on the due date for lodging your income tax return for the income year. If you lodge your return late, the five years starts on the day you lodge it. That is the matter that I have some concern about, or have I incorrectly interpreted the legislation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During my speech on the second reading, I addressed a concern which to date has not been responded to by the minister. That concern is that the tax loss issues are being reviewed by the Australian Taxation Office. If they are being reviewed in the light of the contentious draft rulings TR94/D26 and D42, will the completion of the current review be held up pending a clarification of the current law before the rewrite is progressed? Otherwise, I believe that there could be further confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue that was addressed by the Taxation Institute of Australia concerns the proposed numbering system and the arrangements made for definitions. The duplicate section numbers in the two new schedules, for example, section 1-1 of schedule 2A and section 1-1 of schedule 2B, will create inconvenience in searching for sections in electronic publications and databases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Definitions are included in the bill to help the taxpayer. The way the definitions are scattered all over the place is definitely confusing. For example, the phrase `motor vehicle' is defined in schedule 2A section 11-13, although the phrase is used in other sections, such as schedule 2B section 2-3(6). Does the definition in schedule 2A section 11-1(3) also apply to schedule 2B section 2-3(6)? May I be bold enough to suggest that it would be more helpful to provide the definition at the front of the act and supply any definitions specific to a section at the end of that section. I acknowledge that it is too late to do it now, but these are important principles that should be noted in a further rewriting of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my fervent hope that they need not be mutually exclusive.</PARA>
<PARA>However, some dialogue clarifies this legislation even further. I quote from page 17:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Oh, bullcrap!" Traynor snapped, losing a bit of control. "You old docs have to wake up to a new reality. It's not easy running a hospital in the current environment of cost-cutting, managed care, and government intervention. It isn't cost-plus anymore like you had it. Times have changed, demanding new adaptations and new strategies for survival. Washington is mandating it."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hodges laughed derisively: "Washington sure isn't mandating what you and your cohorts are doing."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The hell they aren't," Traynor argued. "It's called competition, Dennis. Survival of the fittest and the leanest. No more sleight-of-hand cost-shifting like you used to get away with."</PARA>
<PARA>The legislation is the brain child of the department and is influenced by the Australian Health Insurance Association. One can understand the motives of the bureaucracy. It extends its power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The encroachment of bureaucratic organisation into almost every area of health has become increasingly apparent over the last 40 years. Bureaucracy today is the mechanism through which social control can be exercised while the public is totally unaware of it. The catchcry is `accountability', `cost containment' and `casemix' while the bogies are `over-servicing' and `fraud'. All are designed to undermine the credibility of the health professionals and increase the influence of the bureaucracy. The effect has been that our older faith in basic values, such as trust, service and quality, have been devalued or even replaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of all these initiatives is not just to allow insurance carriers to question bills from providers instead of simply paying them, as they have in the past. Rather, it is to use insurance reimbursement policies to determine what medical treatment providers could render. The new reimbursement policies are designed to achieve two goals simultaneously: to ration the services that providers deliver to patients; and to undermine the authority of doctors by creating new definitions of what constitutes good medical practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the process works like this. First, either government regulation or utilisation review by private insurers forces providers to reduce the services they deliver to patients. In the process, new utilisation data are generated upon which to base new definitions of good medical practice. These definitions provide a comparative base to show that providers must have been delivering unnecessary services to patients all along. At that point, many services can be eliminated without arousing much political or professional opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the over-utilisation that is bound to be unmasked when this technique is used can then be explained as the result of ignorance or greed on the part of providers. Thus, the entire process undermines medical authority, debunking both the professional knowledge base and its service ethic. All of these developments then legitimate initiatives to make providers accountable; that is, to subject them to bureaucratic management techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, a new elite has emerged. This elite is made up of health care statisticians, health economists, administrators and consultants. The authority of these new experts increasingly competes with and weakens that of providers. This is an excellent example of the process in which knowledge emerges out of the exercise of power. In this case, while the new experts created, collected and interpreted data which undermined medical authority, they simultaneously created a new knowledge base which supports their own claims to occupational power. If this just sounds like rhetoric, I refer you to what is occurring in the former Repatriation General Hospital in Brisbane today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn to the supposed aims of this legislation. Will this legislation lower the cost of private health insurance? The answer is a resounding no. In her second reading speech, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms will place the health insurance industry in a position to achieve efficiency gains and pass on the benefit of these gains to their members in the form of lower premiums and better controlled costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us analyse that. What does the industry say? Mr Schneider, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Insurance Association, said on 3 March before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a very brave man&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that he said `man', and not `man or woman'; I am sure the minister would enjoy the sexism in that remark&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who predicts that the price of any commodity will go down. I believe two things will happen. Firstly, the rate of growth of premiums will slow. I think it will be beneficial.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that `the rate of growth of premiums will slow'. Big deal! Premiums have increased by 100 per cent in the last five years, and Mr Schneider hopes it will slow as a result of this legislation. I quote him again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we can get it closer to C.P.I. I think it will help people to stay in private health insurance. Secondly, I believe there will be niche products. It may be possible to buy into health insurance for more limited coverage than they can get today at a lower price. That could be very attractive to some section of the market. As I said, it is a very brave man who predicts that the price of any commodity will go down.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us not just rely on the Health Insurance Association. Let us rely on Dr Duckett, the secretary to the department. At the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on 6 March, Dr Duckett said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there are efficiency gains in private hospitals, they can be extracted by increased profits for the private hospitals, or they can be extracted in terms of increased reserves for the private health insurance funds, or they can be extracted in terms of reduced premiums in private health insurance funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think the government could say, if improved efficiency took place, whether it would end up as reduced premiums, increased reserves or increased products. I would not like to guarantee that there would necessarily be an X per cent reduction in premiums, when this bill still leaves a lot of power in the hands of private hospitals and health insurers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the secretary to the department says in contradistinction to the minister. Also, the secretary is supported by the Executive Director of the Australian Health Insurance Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the question of choice in relation to insurance products. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consumers will be able to purchase a product that best suits their needs, at a price that suits their budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us turn to see what Mr Schneider, the man who is responsible for the industry association, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A cheaper product would probably be one which limited the choice of hospitals and doctors and possibly even the value of the benefits paid. The price of the products depends on what you pay on benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>That should be self-evident to everybody, but it is not to the minister. Let us turn to what the secretary to the department said. At the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on 6 March, Dr Duckett said in reply to a question from me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is what you are saying that, if health insurance funds can now cover something that they cannot cover, it will cost more money?</PARA>
<PARA>I replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Duckett said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are quite right. It will.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us turn to casemix. I again quote the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Casemix is the most significant Commonwealth health financing initiative developed in Australia. The implementation of casemix payments will improve efficiency within hospitals and improve the quality and quantity of the information available on what takes place in hospitals and hence improve quality and outcome of health care.</PARA>
<PARA>The first point to make is that casemix is not an Australian initiative. Casemix was developed in the United States in the 1970s and legislated in 1983 in amendments to the American Social Security Act. The department brought in two Americans to develop the casemix program here, as they said there were no Australians with their expertise. You will recall that the department said that $162,000 was paid for a consultancy. Like you, minister, the department made the error, which it had to correct later. Originally, it had said it was $550,000. But the point that I make is that two Americans had to be brought into this consultancy because no Australians were available, according to the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the minister is contradicted by the secretary to her own department yet again. I again quote from the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 16 February. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because we still do not know&mdash;and you have said this in an earlier answer&mdash;what is going to be the outcome in terms of quality patient care at the end.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Duckett said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is right. I agree with you there, I think the monitoring of quality is very poor and we do not know whether the quality of care in New South Wales now without casemix is better or worse than Victoria, with casemix.</PARA>
<PARA>I rest my case. Let me turn to the privacy considerations and the collection of data. On 10 March, a senior departmental officer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the situation could arise in the future whereby some of the modelling results that we are obtaining might indicate that some products are overpriced. In such a circumstance it might be that the minister and the department may wish to use their powers in relation to approving products. But at the end of the day there is power in the legislation now and in the future to refuse premium increases.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the legislation, the department has the authority to do whatever it likes with modelling evaluation and research. The same mantra was chanted in the US at the time of its introduction. It provided the administrative mechanism for subjecting doctors and hospitals to bureaucratic surveillance and manipulation and it legitimised an attack on the credibility of doctors in general by calling into question both their professional knowledge base and their ethics. As I said previously, the objective of these measures is to use insurance reimbursement policies to determine what medical treatment providers could render. Again, I refer you to what is occurring today in my own state of Queensland in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is complex. It is almost certainly unworkable. It fails to address consumer concerns. Price will not be lower and it is adding cost to the industry. Consumers have not been consulted. It is obvious that they are voting with their feet in relation to private health insurance, in that they are only 36.3 per cent now and less than 30 per cent in our state of Queensland. It is restricting freedom. It is aimed at producing uniform mediocrity. It affects public hospitals as well, both in the restriction of private patient access and the added burden of coping with the extra numbers who have dropped their private health insurance. If you consult any public hospital in Australia, they will tell you this. I had a phone call today from Tasmania. I had a phone call yesterday from Queensland. We have had government members complaining about the states of Victoria and New South Wales. We also know that it exists in the other states of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What protection is there for hospitals from the funds? The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Act provides protection against anti-competitive action by any funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Bob Baxt, former Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, said in a letter on 27 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My major concern with the proposed changes to the Health Act is the blind acceptance of the proposition that the commission, by using the Trade Practices Act, will be able to overcome any unfair or improper conduct on the part of powerful health funds, powerful hospitals or other powerful players in the health industry, acting either alone or together.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our major amendment is designed to allow a benefit to be given to hospitals where there is no contract between a hospital and an insurance company. This is designed to protect small rural and specialist hospitals. Even if the cost to be in a hospital is $200 a day, hospitals will still go broke. Currently, hospitals with less than 40 beds cost $340 a day. At this rate, it will take them about one or two months to go broke. Small hospitals have very little power to negotiate with a health fund. Other amendments protect psychiatric rehabilitation and palliative care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of an adequate level of default benefit is vital for two reasons. By taking away the safety net, we are taking away the true raison d'etre of private health insurance as a guarantee for patient, doctor and hospital. Just as importantly, a token or inadequate benefit makes the financial pressure for providers to work under purchaser-provider agreements almost irresistible. For these reasons, we note the amendments which take the proposed default sunset out of the legislation. We see this as a step in the right direction. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ensuring that defaults are ongoing will remove the financial pressure and preserve the voluntary nature of agreements. Without this reassurance, it will be hard for us to do anything but to continue to oppose the legislation as a whole. Our amendments to the provisions of purchaser-provider agreements will ensure a more level playing field between insurers and providers, with the complaints commissioner will act as a watchdog for negotiating processes and practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware that there is considerable debate between provider and insurer groups about what data should be provided and for whom it should be provided. Clearly, insurers need to have patient data relating to the episodes for which claims are being made. It is not as clear why the department or the Private Health Insurance Agency Commission needs anything but that aggregated data. We have an objection in principle to the central role of the department in the data collection and dissemination process. We were interested to note from committee hearings and other sources that it has not been made clear what it actually wants to do with it. Our amendments propose an arms-length data agency, not unlike PHIAC, which would allow the parties to get together first to talk the problem through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe there should be adequate protection of patient privacy and there should be controls over the use of aggregated data. Our amendments will go a considerable way towards addressing these concerns, while making constructive proposals which would give some balance to the negotiating process and enable agreements to be implemented. We have consulted widely with key industry and professional groups, including AHIA, and have approached the government legislation in a constructive manner. We are not targeting health insurers or any other industry group. Nor are we opposed to the negotiation of contracts between funds and practitioners. We are interested in patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a classic example of legislation on the run. We have 17 pages of government amendments. We have 54 amendments already, all introduced at the last minute without consultation. If ever there was a case for referral to a Senate references committee, this is it. In all her protestations about consultation, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) left out consultation with the most important people of all&mdash;those most affected. Where were the consultations with national seniors, the pensioners league, the members of the Medical Benefits Fund and the millions of contributors to private insurance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that this legislation is unworkable. The Council of Procedural Specialists and the Australian Private Hospitals Association have already notified their complete opposition to the proposals. We believe there needs to be reform of the industry. Our amendments are designed to achieve that. We believe there needs to be more community involvement in the process of this legislation because it will affect us all&mdash;one day, one time, unfortunately, but inevitably, nearly all of us will be patients. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not mentioning anybody by name. I was drawing people's attention to the pecuniary interest register. If it hurts people, so be it. This legislation has been deemed necessary because there has been a decline in the number of people with private health insurance. At the same time, there has not been a decline in the number of bed days occupied in private hospitals. That is because people are choosing to self-insure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are people giving up their private health insurance? The most common complaint from people with private health insurance and who use private hospitals is that they get a bill at the end which causes them to have out-of-pocket expenses. Some of those expenses are quite significant. They do not feel that they are getting value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this legislation, people will have the opportunity  to know what out-of-pocket expenses, if any, will be incurred when in a private hospital because their fund may have come to an arrangement with that hospital. They will know the details before they agree to having a procedure. They will be able to give informed consent, because they will know and understand the whole regime that is going to take place and will be aware of the cost involved to them as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the evidence given showed that the out-of-pocket expenses average $79 for doctors and $239-odd dollars for hospitals&mdash;in excess of $300. The majority of older people who have health insurance are not giving it up. They are keeping it. They are pensioners. They are people on lower incomes and they will find the average of $300 quite significant. I have figures from a practice in Brisbane which show that the surgeons are charging something like 75 per cent to 80 per cent as an average over the scheduled fee. That sort of thing is happening and is distorting the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that people know the cost of health services prior to going into hospital. As I said before, it is part of the issue of informed consent. It also gives hospitals, insurance companies and doctors&mdash;if they care to be involved&mdash;an opportunity to offer a range of products to people, to tailor services to people's needs. That is very important. A complaints mechanism will also be set up in this legislation. That is something that Medibank Private is already subject to with the Ombudsman. They have no problems with it; they find that it works very well. They think that, if they are subjected to that mechanism, why shouldn't other private health insurance companies be subjected to it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have talked about the issues of casemix data collection and privacy. I suggest that it is very important that the casemix data collection remains within the purview and the control of the Commonwealth departments. It will be de-identified documentation and material. In our report, we refer to the privacy restraints and constraints that the departments will be subject to&mdash;the Health Insurance Act, the National Health Insurance Act, the Crimes Act and the Privacy Act. You cannot bring private organisations under that umbrella. They are independent. Therefore, they are not subject to monitoring by this body, the parliament, and controlling of how much information can be given or what they do with that information. That is very important. Casemix also means that they will be able to measure apples with apples. They will be able to have greater standardisation of their measuring, which is vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have concerns about giving information to the government despite all those controls. I draw the attention of the Senate to the information required by the government when the government gave private hospitals a subsidy. They had to list the patient's surname, their given names, their Medibank number, their address and their date of birth. They had to list all those things that are far greater identifiers than the de-identified material that they would be required to produce. They were also required to list the patient's health insurance number. The industry was happy to forward those sorts of details to the department prior to this legislation. Now the industry is saying, `Lets not do that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we look at some of the solutions that have been suggested. The Australian Association of Surgeons&mdash;I think Senator Doctor Herron knows that association quite well&mdash;suggested that we remove the means test on free public hospital admission. That is a direct attack on Medicare. That goes back to the conditions that existed prior to 1972 and the introduction of Medicare. One of the reasons I am actually here is because of what it was like working in a public hospital then. After you had your admissions, the next morning the assessment officer came around and classified all of your patients as either private, public or intermediate. The number of people who signed themselves out of hospital because they were means tested into a category that meant they had to pay is nothing short of appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">COTA made a very good point in its submission. It talked about the research that is being done which has found that if people are forced to pay for services that they have difficulty affording then they will choose to seek medical attention and assistance later in that episode of illness and possibly to the detriment of their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also pointed out by the Australian Association of Surgeons that it wants to allow private insurance funds to cover health costs up to the AMA recommended schedule. That would mean that there would be no constraints on the AMA, doctors could charge what they like and everybody else would get constrained. It has also suggested that we should allow some tax relief for private health insurance premiums. That is fine for those on our incomes because anything that reduces our taxable income is good. I finally draw the attention of the Senate to an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 1 March in which Dr Wooldridge said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have had hospital contracts in place in Victoria for four years and it has worked well. . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to Senator Herron's speech I was wondering which piece of legislation it is we are speaking about. I do not think that in my five years in this place I have ever seen a piece of legislation where there has been so much nonsense and so many myths perpetuated and running amok. It has reached epic proportions. The phone calls to my office have been most disturbing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one of the most disturbing was when a woman phoned to say that she had just taken her mother to the orthopaedic specialist. He had told her mother that he could not see her and he could not put her on a waiting list because he may not be allowed to operate when the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill is in place. That is a misinterpretation and a total misunderstanding of where we are. It has got to the point of being absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some genuine concerns about this legislation and there were certainly many when we first saw it back in December. We have reached a stage now after the Senate committee hearings, and the ongoing negotiations and debate with people outside and inside parliament as well as on the phone, where, I believe, we have a package that is workable&mdash;not perfect but even though I expect that the monitoring processes we are putting in place are going to throw up some problems&mdash;but nevertheless is worth putting into place tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wherever in the world there has been a move by a government to put any restrictions on what doctors can charge, there has been the sort of campaign that we have here. I think the huge outcry that we are seeing is quite out of place in that we will not see any compulsion at all in this legislation. That is one key point that seems to be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of reforms is designed, according to the government, to give the private health insurance industry an opportunity to reduce premiums and eliminate out-of-pocket expenses and open up insurance funds and hospitals to greater competition. I am sceptical about the capacity of these reforms to reduce premiums in the short term. I believe that we are looking at a longer term reduction in some of the packages offered or certainly holding the line. Perhaps one of the biggest wins in this legislation is that some packages offered will not include any gaps. When I have spoken to different retiree groups, that is one of the major issues they have raised. Self-funded retirees struggle to keep up with their premiums and then they are hit with not just a few dollars but perhaps hundreds if not thousands of dollars should they require hospital treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it also gives the health insurance industry the impetus and scope to develop more flexible products. The original bill gave far too much power to the health insurance industry. What the Australian Democrats have tried to do in their amendments&mdash;and I believe we have achieved this&mdash;is swing that power base back towards the consumer by putting in a range of different amendments and putting a consumer focus on the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the general thrust of this legislation in terms of what the government hopes to achieve and where I think we are now. But, right from the start, the Democrats had a whole range of major concerns. I will only briefly touch on those as I do not want to spend too much time on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform package basically has five parts. For those who might read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> later or for those who heard Senator Herron's speech I will put clearly on the record what is actually being done in this legislation. We are replacing the current arrangements under which the benefits are paid to hospitals with the casemix payments system which is based on the cost of the entire episode of care. We are replacing the requirements that private health insurance funds pay hospital benefits as determined by the Commonwealth with arrangements which allow the funds to enter into contracts or purchaser-provider agreements with private and public hospitals. It allows funds to enter into agreements with medical practitioners for the provision of professional services in hospitals. These agreements may eliminate out-of-pocket expenses. It establishes an independent Private Health Insurance Complaints Commission to deal with complaints about the private health insurance industry. Finally, it brings all employer based or corporate health insurance schemes within the operation of the Health Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats had a list of major concerns right from the beginning. In particular we were very concerned with the level of power handed over to the private health insurance industry in the original bill. We were also concerned from the initial discussions and looking at the bill that there could be some impact on doctor choice and hospital choice. As we listened through the committee hearings we found that those concerns were simply not able to be justified and some of the rather strange comments from the witnesses led us to believe that a lot of the hype and a lot of the very exaggerated comments that have been made are based on misconceptions as to what this legislation is in fact doing. We had a major concern that there would be an adverse impact on the smaller private hospitals and, in particular, we looked at the lack of a default payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After negotiations with the government, the Democrats have reached a package of amendments which, if accepted by the Senate, will deliver a far better piece of legislation. At the end of the day, we will have vastly improved legislation which protects the most vulnerable of patients as well as ensuring a better deal for both public and private hospitals. We have secured a default benefit which will be paid to all hospitals whether or not they have a contract with the insurer. That benefit will be initially set at the same level as the existing basic table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1997, the default benefit may be directly linked to quality of service and the minister will have the power to reduce or cancel the default benefit should the hospital fail to meet recognised standards of care and treatment. That link will encourage hospitals to seek and gain accreditation. It will not be just a ministerial decision, however, it will be a disallowable instrument which will have to come before both houses of parliament. There would be a very extensive appeal process and one that is open and public for all those who are involved in the industry to participate in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have protected hospitals from arbitrary decisions by insurance funds not to enter into purchaser-provider agreements. There is an amendment which ensures that insurers cannot refuse to enter into agreements with hospitals on a number of grounds, including the size of the hospital, who owns it and the range of services it offers. There is an amendment which enables the new Complaints Commissioner to refer a matter to the TPC, and a clause will be inserted into the legislation to ensure it does not conflict with the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have ensured that hospitals and doctors must inform contributors of the amount a patient will be liable to pay the hospital and doctor for treatment. This is an important amendment for consumers. I for one continue to have complaints from people who are privately insured yet face huge out-of-pocket expenses after their treatment. This amendment does not go as far as we would like, but it is well along the way to where we should be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have protected the interests of vulnerable classes of patients by ensuring that all insurance products covering hospital treatment must include coverage for psychiatric, rehabilitation and palliative care. In addition, a default benefit will be paid by the insurers for treatment in these areas. These issues must be covered in all packages offered by the insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have provided for a patient's charter of rights within the legislation. That charter will be formally introduced and subjected to parliamentary scrutiny at a later date. We have deferred the implementation date for compulsory agreements with private hospitals from 1 July to 1 September. Even though the need for this delay is not as important as it was&mdash;this is because we have got the default benefit&mdash;there will still be a need for administrative arrangements in hospitals, in particular I am advised that some of the forms will need to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have ensured that hospitals and medical purchaser-provider agreements will not be subject to any stamp duty or state and federal charges. We have looked at the whole issue surrounding the employee schemes and have made some changes. The schemes have known for some time now that they will have to cease operation. Having seen this bill in December, they have no doubt been preparing for those changes and making some decisions as to where their fund will go. We still believe that it was right to have pushed the date for the end of the schemes back to September. We have secured an exemption for top up schemes and schemes which are part of an approved enterprise agreement registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those amendments offer a very good outcome for these schemes given the circumstances. However, I still have one concern in this area and that is for those people who are currently members of self-funded schemes who have pre-existing conditions. I have been advised that, based on the decisions in the Federal Court case involving ESSO, the self-funded schemes can continue to meet their liabilities to people with pre-existing conditions even after they have been wound up. I would like the minister to confirm that advice, if possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Democrats have delivered on all of our major concerns. We have maintained a consistent line on this legislation, and we have held our ground. As I have said, we will see a vastly improved piece of legislation if our amendments are successful and as a result of all the negotiations. I will deal in more detail with the monitoring processes that we have set in place as we move through the committee stages but, at this stage, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add: "and, on and from the day the bill has been agreed to by each House, that the following matter stand referred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, for inquiry and report on or before 1 July 1996:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ongoing monitoring of the implementation and operation of the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Act 1995 during the first 12 months after its enactment, with particular reference to the collection of data under the legislation and its provision to the Department of Human Services and Health and the Private Health Insurance Advisory Council.".</PARA>
<PARA>This will set up one of the processes for ongoing monitoring of this legislation by referring the matter to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report on or before 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not just be monitoring the specific contracts and issues directly related, affected or impacted on by this legislation. We also want to put on notice that the Democrats will be monitoring very closely what the funds decide to do. We have been very concerned in the last couple of days after hearing from the people who are currently working in community care in the private sector and with the funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously when I have criticised the funds, I have been very general and have not mentioned a particular fund, but I will mention one tonight. It is Mutual in my home state. Currently, under its supplementary table, it allows 20 home visits for surgical patients following surgery. It has informed the nurses working for it that, after this legislation passes, it will not continue this benefit. Mutual wants to simply work with hospitals. It seems to be looking for an excuse to go back to a casemix basis. This is of great concern when we look at the range of services that these nurses provide. One of the nurses who phoned me last night gave me a whole list of these services, and I am happy to show that to any senators who are interested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to place on notice the fact that we will be watching very carefully the funds' response to this. We hope that they will increase the number of different packages that are viable for the 1990s, rather than cutting back and simply looking at funding the casemix system in the hospitals. I reserve my further comments for the committee stages. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I will not speak on the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994. One of the reasons I will not speak on that bill is that, instead of having 20 minutes to speak, I have now been asked to speak for 10 minutes. I was also asked if I would speak over the dinner break, and I said no.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot get its business organised in time. It has no consideration for the people in this building&mdash;the clerks, the staff of the chamber and everyone else involved. They actually need a dinner break. We went through lunch; we have been here since early this morning and we will be here until late tonight. This government is so disorganised that it wants to have people speaking over the dinner break. I had to put that on the record because I think it is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Herron, you of all people should be interested in this because you have been pushing for occupational health and safety standards in this place to improve. Here we have the very example where we went through lunch yesterday and lunch today and we were going to go through dinner tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having vented my spleen and having had a dinner break, I now feel much better. There is no doubt about it&mdash;the private health insurance system and the health system in general in Australia needs reform. At a time when the beleaguered Clinton administration was looking to our health for inspiration in resuscitating its own ailing system, our minister is inclined to introduce a US style managed care system supported by preferred provider agreements between insurance funds on the one hand and hospitals or medical practitioners on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prime object of this legislation is to stem the mass exodus of the population out of private insurance funds. Senator Crowley, with repeated questions from you, Mr Acting Deputy President, about the problem of the haemorrhaging of people out of private health insurance funds, stood across the chamber time after time telling us it was not a problem&mdash;they were only young people who were not going to place demands on the public health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously Senator Richardson and Minister Lawrence had a very different view. The facts speak for themselves. The proportion of Australians covered by private health insurance has fallen from 59 per cent in February 1984 to an all-time low of 36.3 per cent at the end of last year. During 1994, more than 300,000 Australians dropped out of the private health insurance system. This, as I said, leaves 36.3 per cent of the population with private health insurance cover. That is below the critical figure of 40 per cent that Senator Richardson gave as the critical flashpoint for real problems and disasters in the private health insurance system. Despite what Senator Crowley says, a resultant demand and pressure is being brought to bear on public hospital systems and that cannot be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know where Senator Crowley goes when we are not here. People say to you, `Oh, you're having a holiday now the Senate has risen.' Let me tell you that people on this side do not have holidays. If you go through rural Victoria as I do and speak to CEOs of small rural hospitals throughout Victoria, they will tell you one of the things that has affected their operation is the number of people who have left private health insurance and are no longer covered and the depletion in their funding because they do not have those privately insured patients. I do not know where Senator Crowley goes during the break but it is obviously not to small hospitals in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the seven years to 1994, private health insurance premiums have grown by over 100 per cent. This rise in premiums has significantly outstripped the growth in CPI. There is no question that one of the predominant reasons for the mammoth dropout rate is the cost of insurance. We have seen that in the literature, in the research and I also see it in my office. I have pensioner after pensioner coming in saying, `I have done everything&mdash;I have gone without things, I have gone without repairs in my house, I have gone without necessary things&mdash;to pay my health insurance. I can no longer do it.' Many of them have put themselves at risk by dropping out of the private health insurance system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 41,000 who dropped their cover in the last quarter of 1994, half were Victorians. That demonstrates that the states are bearing the brunt of the federal government's ineptitude on this issue. Dr Lawrence believes that her reforms, amongst other things, will reduce private health insurance premiums. I want to know where the evidence for this is. It seems to me a quantum leap in faith. She was not backed up by her senior bureaucrats in this, nor was she backed up by other people who gave evidence at the committee. They did not say that it was a foregone conclusion that we were going to see any change in private health insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing self-evident in this bill to show that this will be achieved. There is no certainty that the increased efficiencies or increases in membership hoped for will translate into reduced premiums. Even the AHIA, a major proponent of these reforms, says that at best the rate of increase in premiums might slow down. I believe we will see premiums increasing but at a slower rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What incentive is there for health insurance funds to channel efficiencies into reduced premiums rather than increased profits? What is there to ensure that the increased administrative and compliance costs and levies will not contribute to the very premiums the minister hopes will fall? Basically this legislation is a great package of wishful thinking on the part of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under purchaser-provider agreements, health funds will acquire a range of hospital facilities and professional medical services at agreed prices and fees to support a range of health cover products at different premium cost levels. It is hoped that the total cost of an episode of care will be met by insurance but only where treatment is by a doctor and in a hospital contracted to the health fund. The first casualty will of course be choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers in their capacity as patients of our health system will be the ultimate judges of these reforms. It is by reference to their expectations and demands that the success or failure of these reforms will be measured, not by reference to the bottom line of balance sheets of health insurance funds, or indeed those of hospitals or medical practitioners. It is proper that industry bodies have an input but let us not overlook the patient. I do not know how many people have discussed the patient tonight but that is really the end of the line. The patients ought to be the group we are concentrating on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Council of Procedural Specialists has already indicated that it will not enter into any such contractual relations under these reforms as such relations would offend one of its own resolutions made in 1993 as well as facilitate insurance companies in seeking to exert their influence upon the nature and manner of treatment given to patients by their doctors. The council says that now. I can remember general practitioner after general practitioner who said they would never become vocationally registered. But when the dollars start flapping people change their minds. With all the best will in the world, I am not sure that the proceduralists will not be influenced in the same way as the general practitioners were to conform with the government demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government scoffs at suggestions that this legislation might facilitate interference in the manner in which a doctor treats a patient. Yet this is very much a valid concern. The duration of an episode of care for a given diagnosis will be determined. To the extent that actual duration deviates from the regulated duration, practitioners may obviously encounter difficulty in maintaining different levels of fees for the care they are required to give.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues of market distortion arise, which may well be beyond the auspices of the TPC. We euphemistically speak of negotiating purchaser-provider agreements when the market features large funds that can bargain from a position of strength as compared with smaller funds likely to be pushed to the wall or taken over. We need to consider, too, the smaller hospitals, particularly in rural areas, which lack the muscle of their larger city counterparts. The reality may well amount to compelling agreements upon pain of possible financial ruin or at least financial loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether trade practices protections and remedies are available to aggrieved market players is by no means a clear-cut matter. The TPC says that the `context of a situation' is an important factor in deciding such an issue and that the purpose of the particular conduct needs to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government really did not do its homework on these reforms. In setting up a start-up date of 1 April, no thought appears to have been given to the logistical difficulties involved in adapting existing arrangements to the new regime. The Victorian government in its submission to the Community Affairs Committee described the `timeliness for the introduction of these reforms as totally unrealistic'. The government has now been forced to extend this start-up date to September and the coalition believes that this is not sufficient and it should be extended to January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government prescribed no minimum amount which a health fund would be required to pay for treatment of a patient in a hospital with which it has no contract. The government, again, was forced to concede it got this wrong. It is no doubt a good idea to provide the consumer with more information about the cost of treatment and the government said it intended this. However, it was not borne out by the terms of the legislation. Again, the government has been forced to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has become de rigueur with so much of the government's legislation, the failure to consult prior to the formulation of what is very comprehensive legislative reform has once again, in the case of this bill, necessitated wholesale amendments without which this legislation would be totally unpalatable and unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe it is a Western Australian disease that Minister Lawrence has because when her former colleague Mr Dawkins when he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training undertook reforms of the higher education system&mdash;I do not know that you would call them reforms, disastrous reforms&mdash;he had what was called a purple circle. If you were not in the purple circle, forget it; you were not part of the consultation. That is how former Minister Dawkins brought in his reforms to education. They have proved to be an absolute disaster. If anybody can show me one bit of cost saving resulting from the forced amalgamations of universities, then I would be surprised. </PARA>

That is not consultation.

As I said, they would not all be winners but at least they would have felt that they had made a contribution and that it was the best that they could all do together. That is what it ought to be&mdash;a cooperative effort; not the duchess of division dividing the health groups. It is hopeless if you have the procedural specialists saying they are not going to be part of it. It is hopeless if you have the private hospitals not feeling that they have been adequately consulted and involved.

We ought to have had more time to look at it. We asked for that. Senator Herron and I suggested that the legislation should go back. We are now rushing through in the 11th hour very serious legislation which will affect every Australian, and all you can do over there is laugh. I'll tell you what, in a few months time when the legislation comes back, you will say, `Oh, we didn't mean this. There's an error. We didn't mean this amendment. We've got to have an amendment to fix this,' and we will have a swag of amendments on the health bill. I will say to you, `I told you so.' We will remind every Australian of the inappropriate way that this legislation has been formed, has been amended and will be, let me assure you, amended again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has introduced the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 because it wishes to give the people of Australia the best possible health system available. The foundation of the health care system in Australia is Medicare. The guarantee of universal health is supported by an overwhelming number of Australians; in fact, 87 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to a proper level of funding to allow the high level of health service that Australians enjoy to be provided through the states. In light of this, it is a disgrace to see the states of New South Wales and Victoria underspending their budgets for health services funded by the Commonwealth by $300 million and $370 million respectively for the 1993-94 year. Further, the government is committed to diversity and to providing the choice of seeking private health care through the mechanism of private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a truth universally acknowledged that in recent years there has been a decline in the level of participation in private health insurance. The fact is that private health insurance is just not worth the money, and that is what this piece of legislation intends to address. Consumers pay a substantial premium, usually on a weekly basis. They think their medical needs are covered. When they require dental treatment or go into hospital for an operation, they discover that this is not the case. Yes, insurance funds pay some of the cost, but a substantial amount of those costs still comes out of the person who has been paying premiums until that time. This is a problem for the health industry and it is a problem for the public health system. The government and the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, are well aware of this problem, and that is why they have attempted to deal with it through this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of the bill is to increase participation in private health insurance, and it is going to be done in two ways: to make health insurance more attractive by making it more responsive to consumer needs and to increase the capacity of the health insurance industry to provide an efficient and competitive product by contracting with the medical providers. The most important area of reform is the provision of more choices for the consumer and, in fact, an empowerment of the consumer that to date they have not had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill puts the consumer in the driver's seat. This legislation gives consumers protection that they did not have. They will know in advance what they are being charged for medical services or a hospital stay. They will know how much their fund will cover and, if they are required to pay anything out of their own pockets, how much. Further, consumers will know in advance which medical providers their fund has contracted with. The consumer will have real choice. They will have all the information to make an intelligent choice and they will be able to weigh up the cost of that choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, this is not the situation. Presently, consumers go to a doctor who refers them to a specialist and then in turn suggests a hospital. They go along to the hospital and they do not know how much the hospital is going to charge, and they do not know how much the fund will reimburse them. They just go into hospital and pray that they will not have to pay too much at the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, consumers under this legislation will be able to choose a package with lower premiums, if they are happy with the medical practitioners and hospitals with which the funds have contracted. They will be able to choose a package that covers 100 per cent of all cost, which they are not able to do now. They will have a real choice because they will have all the information available to them. The fact is that at the present time the power is all in the hands of the medical providers who hold the information that consumers need to make a real choice. This bill changes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have a great deal of time, but I have to say that this constant allegation that there has been insufficient consultation is quite preposterous. I really want to quickly address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of the health insurance reforms has been going on for a long time. In fact, the reforms first began in December 1993, with the release of a press release and a discussion paper. Eight and a half thousand copies of the discussion paper were distributed, and 200 submissions were received in response. Those responses were drawn from 77 individual consumers, six public hospitals, 20 health service providers, 11 private hospitals, 25 funds and representatives, 22 doctors, and many others. On the basis of these submissions, a working party was set up to make a report on the reforms plus prepare a number of specialist reports&mdash;in connection with which, again, there was constant consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1994 the legislation was introduced&mdash;and that is now almost six months ago. As well as these steps, the government consulted, between December 1993 and February 1995, on a further 61 occasions with both groups and individuals. Further, the Senate community affairs committee, of which I am a member, received 83 submissions, heard 13 hours of evidence and subsequently prepared a report that is before us. The fact is, this bill has been a model of consultation. To say otherwise is a fallacy. I draw to a conclusion and commend this bill and the reforms contained within it to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel constrained by the time limits that have been put upon this debate. The health insurance bill is such an important piece of legislation that I am somewhat frustrated I cannot address all the problems faced in it. Let me say at the beginning, we support the basic principles involved in this legislation. It is an attempt, albeit a failed attempt, to try to redress the imbalance which has developed between the public systems and the private systems. That is something which even the Labor Party recognised. Senator Richardson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think my primary role is to administer Medicare and that means public access and public hospitals. That has to be the thrust of all that I do. But you cannot do it properly unless there is a vibrant private sector, and I think that is what has been missed over the course of the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the reasons why waiting lists are so long, why it is such a difficulty is that we have let private health insurance numbers get too low.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an attempt to redress that problem&mdash;however, it is an attempt which is not going to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do people not take out private health insurance? There are a number of reasons. The most important reason I guess is cost. When you think about it, as a privately insured patient, you are potentially paying four times over: you are paying your private health insurance premium, you are paying your general taxes, you are paying your Medicare levy and, at the end of the day, when you have had your treatment, you will pay more either to the doctor or sometimes to the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Neal asked the question: why do they have to pay? The answer, particularly relating to the gap, is: they have to pay because this government has made it illegal to cover for the gap. So there is a simple reason why they have to pay: they have to pay because of the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, these reforms will not improve the number of people with private health insurance; witness after witness at the committee inquiry reaffirmed that. `At best, we may get a slowing down in the rate of decline'&mdash;and that was evidence which was given by my good friend Russell Schneider who I see sitting in the gallery paying close attention to the matters at hand. If we are lucky, we will slow down the rate of deterioration&mdash;and that is not much of an aim for a piece of legislation which is as important as this is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other problems which this legislation will actually introduce and make worse. Let me address, first of all, the problem that this will have on hospitals, one of the two keystones of our health system. Effectively, this bill abandons small rural and specialist hospitals&mdash;`specialist' including things like psychiatric and rehabilitation hospitals. This is not just private hospitals but public ones as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After this legislation is in place, hospitals will have to have a contract with insurers if they are to survive. They will suffer a default payment if they do not have a contract, but that default payment will be set by the minister, and nobody really knows what it will be. It may be tied to the basic payment; it may not be. But, even if it is, it will cease in 1988. If it is set, as has been suggested, at $200 a day, essentially the hospitals will go broke. Smaller hospitals&mdash;that is, hospitals of around 40 and 50 beds&mdash;currently generate around $340 to $350 a day in revenue. On that basis, it will take most of those hospitals between one and two months to go broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those hospitals really do not have any power to negotiate with a monopolistic health fund, which may be a giant in that particular state, and it is unfair to expect the hospitals to negotiate on their own, but they have to because the TPA usually will not let hospitals negotiate in groups. What the government has said here and elsewhere is that those hospitals can get authorisation and negotiate together. Apparently, the government seems to think that is an easy process. But Bob Baxt, the Chairman for the Trade Practices Commission, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authorisation process is also a costly and time consuming one. It could take six to nine months and in some situations the whole process takes over 2 1/2 years.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine. So, in that six months or maybe years, the hospital has to go into bat for itself, and it faces bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What protection does the bill offer if a larger insurer does not make a reasonable offer or if it makes no offer at all? Apparently, a hospital can complain to the Complaints Commissioner, although there is some doubt about that if there is no contract. The Complaints Commissioner can then refer the matter to the TPC. The TPC has a month to say whether or not it is going to investigate. If it does investigate, it then reports its terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what happens if there is no attempt made to contract with the hospital? The TPC is then not even applicable and cannot do anything. If the hospital does not receive a phone call or a letter, there is no compulsion to deal in any industry. That is the advice, again from Bob Baxt. But, if it can investigate, we have been told by Professor Baxt that it will be almost impossible for the TPC to prove that a fund had misused its market power. That, I think, was illustrated by Bob Baxt when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be very difficult for a private hospital or the TPC to establish the purpose behind the health fund's refusal . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And, again, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, we believe that a private hospital would not have recourse against a health fund as a result of unfair treatment by that fund. It is impossible to prove that there is a misuse of power.</PARA>
<PARA>So what can the Complaints Commissioner do then? He can make recommendations. So what? In effect, the Complaints Commissioner can go right back to the hospital and say, `Sorry, I can't do much'. What can the hospitals do now a couple of months on? They can apply to the Federal Court for an injunction. But there is a wealth of evidence to indicate, firstly, that that is a slow process; secondly, that it has very little guarantee of success; and, thirdly, that it is also a very expensive process. Application can be made to the TPC for help. But, again, Bob Baxt has commented about the likelihood of that succeeding. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission has limited resources and will be unable, in my view, to deal effectively with what has been described to me as a typical case of a powerful health fund or a group of funds refusing to deal with a small hospital.</PARA>
<PARA>So hospitals may have spent a lot of time on this process but in the end they go broke. It does not matter whether the hospital is one of really high quality, a specialist hospital or a longstanding community asset. It still goes broke because this government has not put into place any sensible legislation to give it any power over its own destiny. When hospitals start to go broke in this country because of this legislation, the coalition will remind them of this day and of the government and, indeed, the Democrats who made it happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other problems with the legislation as well. One of the reasons for taking out private health insurance is to ensure choice&mdash;that is, essentially, choice of doctor and choice of hospital. Under this process there will be a diminution of choice; there is no question about that. There will still be some choice, but the freedom of choice, the breadth of that choice will be undermined by this legislation. That is something which I think all of us will decry. We have differing views about the extent of that, but it is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We actually have no real problems with the fact that there is a Complaints Commissioner; it may be of some advantage. The problem with this, of course, is that it is going to be paid for by the consumer which, indeed, means that health costs will increase to the consumer. Also, there seems to be no appeal to the Complaints Commissioner. Indeed, it seems that the Complaints Commissioner can only make recommendations; the Complaints Commissioner has no power. That is a two-edged sword, but it does seem to undermine some of the reasons for having a Complaints Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, again, the problem of an undermining of the basic principles of community rating. It seems that there will be an increased freedom for health funds to offer packages which exclude specific diseases. I know that most of the original current health funds will offer the same tables as an option. But, clearly, in this situation, they will be pushing the tables which more suit them. It seems to me that they will, for example, exclude hip replacements, something we heard of a couple of years ago from Medibank Private with its `select and save' process. At that time, the Australian Health Insurance Association, as I remember, was very critical of Medibank Private because it did undermine community rating. So I guess the question we have to ask is: what has happened to that view about offering packages which exclude specific diseases which may relate to particular age groups, for example?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we finish up with a situation where this legislation will not put costs down. Not only has Russell Schneider indicated that would happen but John Loy from the department has also indicated that costs will not fall as a result of this. Choice will fall. We will be moving towards an American system where a HMO-type approach will predominate. I have no problems with HMOs if it is a matter of choice. What I am concerned about is that there will not be a real choice in this matter. Total cover will be available. That is something which we welcome. It was part of our policy in the last election campaign to allow people to cover for the costs which they faced. Although the approach taken was a slightly different approach, the essence of it was the same thing: that you should not be out of pocket. We had no particular problem with that. The difficulty with that is that there are no real barriers now to offering total cover. Indeed, in some states, certainly in Victoria and I think in your own state, Senator Crowley, it is possible to get pretty well total cover as a result of deals which have been done between purchasers and providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other outstanding features which was touched upon by Senator Neal in her discussion was the consultations. She went to great lengths to say how extensive the consultation process had been. But the facts of the matter are very simple. In the evidence given to the Senate committee, I think 65 out of 66 people were critical of the process undergone either as a result of the legislation itself or as a result of the consultation process. Time and time again we had criticism from groups which had not been consulted. Senator Neal pointed out incorrectly that this legislation has been there for six months. It was introduced in December. We are now in March. That is 3 1/2, perhaps four months at most. Her time scale is obviously different to mine. It just seems like six months when you listen to Senator Neal speak. However, it has not been offered for wide consultation and a number of important groups, professional and non-professional, consumer and non-consumer, are very concerned about the lack of consultation which has occurred about this legislation. It is vital legislation; it is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the contracting out of services, of pushing doctors into contracts, this is again something which we have concerns about because although the contracts will not be obligatory, in essence as time goes on they will become obligatory. The new doctor setting up a new practice will not be able to set up a viable practice unless he has entered into a contract with a health fund or a group of health funds. So, de facto the issue will become one of compulsion for doctors to enter into contracts. Those at present who have large viable practices may choose not to enter into that particular contract but with the passage of time it will become impossible for a doctor to have a viable practice unless he has a contract, which essentially is another example of the restriction of choice which will occur as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in essence I have concerns that this will not lower costs. It will not increase the number of people with private health insurance. It will not relieve the strain and pressure on the public hospitals by encouraging people to take out private health insurance. It will remove or at least reduce the choice of doctor and the choice of hospital. The Complaints Commissioner will have no powers. There will be no appeal against it and there will be an increased cost. It will also as a result of this legislation give unusual powers to the minister, powers which may relate to intrusion of privacy, and power for the minister to decide what is a quality hospital. We have a very good system in the hospital sector of accreditation. The accreditation is a voluntary process but one which works very well. If you are not an accredited hospital, then most health funds will not pay you a top rate of return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a system that works well. There is no need for the minister to be given this extra power to say to a hospital `You are not meeting the standards'. I have terrible fears that the minister might start using this power in the same way that it has been used in the nursing home industry. The nursing home industry is moving away from that, yet it seems here in the hospital sector that we are moving towards that. We have a system which works very well at no cost to the consumer or to the government or to the taxpayer. Why would we want to move away from a system which works so well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last problem which I have time to touch upon today is that problem again of consultation. It is vitally important in legislation as crucial as this that people are consulted when they have an interest in the issue. That has not been done with this legislation. I have grave fears that this will not improve the system but will make the system worse. </PARA>

<PARA>The reason I moved that amendment was to defer it until 1 January. That gives a pre-contract period of eight months. I do not believe, as Senator Lees apparently does, that that is sufficient time for the government's amendments to be dealt with. This would also minimise any advantage to those funds and hospitals which have already started to negotiate or seek to negotiate unofficially, and gives smaller hospitals and funds a reasonable opportunity to be competitive in the negotiating area. That was the reason behind my amendment. It is all very well to say that that will happen within a few short months, but I believe that this is such a major change to the structure of the whole health care industry in the private sector that more time is needed. </PARA>

The amendments to proposed section 73AB of the act require hospitals to submit the hospital casemix protocol data to funds within six weeks of the discharge of the patient and for the funds to send the data on to the Department of Human Services and Health within a one-week period three months after the date of discharge. The times are structured to provide sufficient time for the data to be collected but will limit any delays. </PARA>

There are certain dental practitioners who are oral surgeons who work full time within hospitals, dental hospitals in particular, who have the right of private practice and who treat private patients. Is that what you mean by including dental practitioners? Or do you mean all dental practitioners, whether or not they are working in private hospitals, as some of them do? Is it a blanket definition for all dental practitioners, not oral surgeons? There are dental practitioners who work in private hospitals who are not oral surgeons, and also dental practitioners who work in public dental hospitals treating private patients who have the right of private practice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both the hospitals and the doctors are concerned about the possibility of individuals and groups of providers being picked off by the funds in the negotiating process, particularly in states where Medibank Private and one or two other funds dominate the market. For instance, in Western Australia we heard that 70 per cent of coverage was by one fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all providers would necessarily be disadvantaged. Specialists in numerically small specialities could actually be in a very strong position. There are certain specialties where there are very small numbers of people and they would obviously be in a much stronger position. After seeking advice from the shadow Treasurer on the trade practice implications of fostering group arrangements, we have decided against the Australian Private Hospitals Association and the Australian Medical Association preference for group negotiations to be completely removed from the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New subsection 73BD(5) would instead allow hospitals and practitioners to appoint agents to negotiate on their behalf if they so desire. These agents could be an individual or an organisation such as the Australian Private Hospitals Association or the AMA. The agency negotiation would then need to be ratified by the individual practitioner or hospital by signing the negotiated agreement on its own behalf. We believe this would minimise the legal perception of such group negotiations being seen as anti-competitive or even cartel forming and we believe it is important that they be highlighted. We believe that they are making it more fair and competitive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no problem with the intent of the amendment, but I do have a problem with its wording. The sentence on the second last line begins `rendered of any amounts that the eligible contributor will be liable to pay'. I respectfully suggest that that end phrase should be amended to `could reasonably be expected to pay'. When the word `liable' is used, it implies legal obligation. By inserting the words `could reasonably be expected to pay', no legal liability is implied. There are many occasions when the patient is certainly liable by implication. As senators know, the bill may be sent to a debt collector, but that is very uncommon. If we remove `will be liable' and make it `could reasonably be expected', it removes that liability to pay the professional service. Therefore, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

At around 5.15 or 5.30 this afternoon we did receive a large number of answers to questions which had been taken on notice and I am very grateful for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one problem, however; that is, the question I most wanted answered in relation to charges under the Public Service Act against a senior executive service officer in relation to six items of misconduct was not answered. No explanation was provided at the time the answers came back from the committee as to why that question had not been answered. It was very clearly shown that an undertaking was given at page 87 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Yet that undertaking was not met in so much as the information was not provided this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 6.15 p.m., I indicated to the government whip that I intended to call a quorum and would continue to call for quorums until that information was provided. That resulted in further discussions with Senator Collins's office and, ultimately, with Senator Collins, the result of which was that Senator Collins believed we had an agreement that the information would be provided to me tomorrow morning. I distinctly remember&mdash;and I do not want to get into a long discussion about it&mdash;saying to Senator Collins that was not satisfactory as far as I was concerned because it precluded me from making a comment about the information in as full and as wide ranging a fashion as I would want. Although the information would obtain privilege by virtue of its being presented to the committee when the Senate was not sitting, I would not in fact be able to speak on it to the full extent because parliament would not be in session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why at 8.30 p.m., two hours having elapsed, no answers having come back and then being told by Senator Collins's staffer that he intended to provide the information to me tomorrow, I called a quorum. Subsequent to that, I had a long discussion with Senator Collins and we sorted the matter out on the following basis: that Senator Collins would provide that information to me or to the committee for my benefit tomorrow morning; that is, he would provide the full report of the investigation officer who was appointed under section 62 of the Public Service Act; and that Senator Collins would further provide, if possible, before 10 April, which is the sitting of the rural and regional affairs committee in relation to AQIS in Melbourne, an answer to the issue of whether any officers of AQIS had provided references to Mr Corrigan to enable him to take up a job with the Meat Hygiene Service in the United Kingdom. On that basis, I would be happy not to call for a quorum again tonight. That agreement, I think, will see an amicable solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of points. First, it is absolutely ludicrous that questions taken on notice should take over a month, in this case almost six weeks, to come back to a committee. I think Senator Robert Ray, on the other side, is fairly reasonable and would recognise that six weeks is a long time. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robert Ray" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Depends on the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of those questions are fairly obvious, Senator Ray. But to get nothing back in six weeks is unsatisfactory, especially as this is the last sitting day of this sitting. We will go into the budget sittings still without answers to questions from the supplementary estimates. The hearings of 15 February were a continuation of hearings that had been set down for 29 November. At that rate we would not get any satisfaction at all. I think it is absolutely unsatisfactory that it should take so long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is ridiculous that senators from the opposition should be put in a situation where they cannot do anything to get the information they request and have to wait another six weeks before we get another sitting day. If that is to be the case, then obviously the estimates process will become a farce. Senator Collins tells me, and I accept the fact, that was not his intention. Obviously when that committee examines further estimates I will be hoping to progress some more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to make one other comment in relation to Mr Corrigan; that is, to place on record one very important fact which must be understood. I am certainly of the belief that AQIS officers provided references for Mr Corrigan at the time at which he was under investigation. I also know that the UK government was advised that Mr Corrigan was under investigation at the time at which he was appointed. I am yet to precisely establish when he was appointed, but we now know that Mr Corrigan was granted extended leave of absence on 7 September 1994. In spite of that being granted on 7 September 1994, none of the senior executive service officers of AQIS thought it a relevant fact to add to the evidence they were providing to the committee on 29 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Corrigan's leave of absence had been approved at the beginning of September and some 2 1/2 months later, knowing that he was about to take up his leave of absence, officers did not draw it to my attention or to the attention of any other senator at the estimates hearings when Mr Corrigan's investigation was discussed. I believe&mdash;and I have said it before but I will say it in the chamber&mdash;that material information was withheld from the estimates committee. I am not saying that Senator Collins was part of that because I do not believe Senator Collins knew the arrangements, but I do believe that senior officers withheld information from the estimates committee. It is very clear that the leave of absence was approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the secretary of the department, who approved the leave of absence, was not there, other officers who knew all about it were there. They knew we were examining the whole case in the context of a long delay in finalising the investigation and, for that information to have slipped their mind, I find totally and utterly unbelievable. I place on record my dissatisfaction that the process has developed in this fashion. I do not think that is the proper way for estimates questions to be dealt with, and I hope we will see some improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service on notice that I will be continuing to pursue this. I look forward to the minister's answers. We are slowly extracting the full story about Mr Phillip Corrigan. That story will be revealed, whether departmental officers like it or not. I think the best way for all concerned is for departmental officers to start to cooperate more fully in the whole process so that, whatever the result, it is arrived at speedily rather than slowly because, the more drawn out this becomes, the more painful it is for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, I look forward to receiving the answer to the committee which Senator Collins has undertaken to give to me tomorrow. I also look forward to the answer to the question of what AQIS officers, if any, provided references for Mr Corrigan. Certainly the answer that was given to a question in the House of Commons by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries indicates that the UK government was certainly of the belief that Mr Corrigan was coming with references from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A motion of censure of a private Member has been moved on only one occasion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I am under the impression never on a senator. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a number of occasions a motion of censure of the Leader of the Opposition, or an amendment expressing censure in the form of an alternative proposition, has been agreed to. These are considered to be bad precedents. Such resolutions, as distinct from a resolution of the House suspending or expelling a Member, are of no substantive effect and are only regarded as an expression of opinion by the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say I would never take the House of Representatives' opinion even vaguely seriously at the moment, and I certainly do not take this political stunt seriously. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A motion in the form of a censure of a Member, such as the Leader of the Opposition, not being a member of the Executive Government, is not consistent with the parliamentary convention that the purpose of a vote of censure is to question or bring to account a Minister's responsibility to the House.</PARA>
<PARA>I mention this to show not only that it was a political stunt in the other chamber but also that it demeaned the party and the minister who introduced it, who was acting as the puppet of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who just cannot stand me because I keep scoring points against him in the sense that I keep revealing the facts of his extraordinary financial investments. They are extraordinary in the sense that he has only been earning, or at least seen to have been earning, the income of a parliamentarian ever since he was a young man, and certainly has apparently had no access to large riches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have a situation where, if you like, to satisfy the fury, to expiate the rage of this Prime Minister, this absurd resolution was passed in the House of Representatives today, which <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice</EMPHASIS> clearly indicates to be a bad precedent and, of course, a bit of political stupidity. On top of that, as I indicated earlier today, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) behaved in a disgraceful way in the House of Representatives by being party to an arrangement to deceive the chamber about the basis of a statement attributed to a spokesman for the taxation commissioner, when the taxation commissioner has denied to me&mdash;and I believe him&mdash;that any spokesman for the tax office made such a statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, I advise the Senate that, when we next meet, I will be giving the following notice of motion: That the Senate notes that the Commissioner for Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, has stated today that no tax official made a statement on which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>'s report of the 25 March 1995 is based to the effect that yesterday a tax office spokesman said the tax commissioner was considering referring Senator Baume's action to the police, the Federal Director of Public Prosecutions and the Privacy Commissioner for investigation; and notes that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> report is similar to paragraph 9 of the confidential minute of 24 March 1995 from the second tax commissioner, Mr P. E. Simpson, to the Treasurer, Mr Willis, which says: `I am considering whether the matter will be referred to the Privacy Commissioner, the Australian Federal Police or the Director of Public Prosecutions for further investigation'&mdash;isn't it remarkably similar&mdash;calls on the Treasurer to assure the parliament that he did not authorise or request anyone to commit the offence of holding themselves out to be a tax office spokesman; and requires the Treasurer to introduce a police inquiry into who in his office committed this offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a confidential minute from the tax office to the Treasurer. It was not to be sprayed around, and it was not to be available to people widely. The tax commissioner has assured me that no officer of the tax department made this statement to the newspaper. The onus is on Mr Willis to demonstrate that he has clean hands in this matter and if any one of his staff behaved in this illegal way, they should be exposed and investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is massively keen to get the Federal Police to investigate things. It claims that I am going to be investigated. What absolute nonsense! There is no way such an investigation can or will proceed. Such an investigation cannot properly be constituted as a police inquiry. The proposal is absurd. It is a political stunt. I will say this: I will not cooperate with such a stunt if I am asked to because it is improper and illegal and is in breach of two statutes of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to conclude by saying that I did hear some disgraceful speeches in the House of Representatives today&mdash;one by Mr Hollis, which was beneath contempt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald only displays his own ignorance&mdash;and to make parliament more representative. In this election the Labor Party ran a record number of women candidates in winnable seats. Labor women were elected in the lower house seats of Badgerys Creek, Penrith, Cabramatta, Parramatta, Peats, Heffron, Blacktown, Port Jackson and Swansea. One other woman candidate was narrowly defeated in Sutherland. Five more Labor women have been elected to the upper house. An important point to note about these women, with the exception of Badgerys Creek, is that they all hold safe Labor seats. That fact is proof in New South Wales that the Labor Party membership has committed itself to giving women the best possible chance to hold the positions and to make the parliament truly representative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast this with the New South Wales Liberal Party&mdash;a very sorry record. The only high profile woman in state parliament, the deputy leader, Kerry Chikarovski, has once again been shouldered aside, with a deal being done between the boys as they fight over Fahey's leadership spot. In the upper house the hard right of the Liberal Party went so far as to force the hardest working woman, Beryl Evans, out of the party's ranks. Ms Evans has since retired from public life, bitterly hurt by her treatment at the hands of her Liberal colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also compare this with the situation in this chamber. The Labor Party in New South Wales has six senators, including two women; that is 33 per cent of positions. The New South Wales Liberal Party has three senators, none of whom are women&mdash;that is nil. The New South Wales National Party has two senators, neither of whom are women&mdash;that is nil. There should be no more pious rubbish in this place about the Labor Party's commitment to women and women's participation in Parliament House, because there certainly is a commitment there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention briefly some of the candidates who have been elected to parliament in the last election, because they certainly are fine women of great quality. The newest party member, Diane Beamer, who was only elected last night, is a woman of great energy, who is very vocal and an outstanding advocate for her area. She left school, married young and, whilst raising a family, also undertook a university degree. She subsequently went on to work for members of parliament, to represent her community and local government, and her commitment to the community has been acknowledged in this result today. I am very pleased to congratulate her very heartily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also there is Reba Meagher, who is a young woman who was elected in the by-election. Reba Meagher hailed from Young Labor. She was twice elected president of the 4,000 strong member organisation. Young Labor in New South Wales is a very strong party organisation. During her term young Labor was revitalised, taking a much higher public profile in the issues of youth employment, law reform and education issues. She was tertiary educated&mdash;one of the generation of young people who gained access to higher education under the massive university expansion initiated by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reba Meagher has also worked extremely effectively for some years as industrial advocate for the Transport Workers Union, before winning her preselection for the seat of Cabramatta.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also Marie Andrews who was elected to the safe seat of Peats on the central coast&mdash;someone for whom I personally have great admiration. She has had a very long career. After having served the transport officers union for many years and the public service, she decided to make a contribution in the public sphere by running for the seat of Peats. She also has been successfully elected to that seat and, again, with an increased majority&mdash;a swing of almost five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot conclude my remarks without mentioning another candidate, now member: the member for Parramatta, Gabrielle Harrison. I had the pleasure of meeting Gabrielle Harrison some time ago when we were both at university, where she was the President of the Macquarie University students representative group. Gabrielle has continued to participate at that level. She proceeded to complete her arts degree and also to complete part of a law degree before working in the area of law in New South Wales. During that time, her husband unfortunately passed away and she was left a widow. But in spite of all that, and with Tristan her young son, she took on the challenge and successfully won the seat of Parramatta. </PARA>

As general secretary of the New South Wales branch and as the campaign director for that campaign, John Della Bosca had to bear the brunt of that attack.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some senators have anonymously received documents indicating that over five years ago my wife took out a restraining order against me. Although the matter was not proceeded with, I am, of course, deeply ashamed of the incident which led to her taking such action. The occasion has long since passed. However, my remorse and distress have lived with me. My wife is, naturally, intimately aware of my deep regret and has always stood by me. She always has given, and continues to give, me the most wonderful support in every way, including in my political career. I hope this matter will be viewed against the background that I have always as a senator sought to discharge my duties and my responsibilities on behalf of my constituents and my party with diligence and dedication. As an office bearer of the Senate, I have always sought to act with fairness and impartiality. Esther, my wife, has asked that I read a short statement of hers on this matter:</PARA></TALK.START>

The network will close down operations for the sake of, as I say, nearly $15,000. It received some commendation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> report. The family court division is, I understand, funded by the federal government, with a contribution by the Victorian government which has been withdrawn.

<PARA>the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Score Reading Panel was established by ABC Concerts in November 1992. Forty three composers have submitted scores for assessment. Of these, four works have been recommended for performance, and nine composers have been recommended for commissioning. Frequently, composers whose work the Panel considers deserving of support, have submitted works which themselves are not suitable or feasible for orchestral performance and in these cases, the Panel has recommended that the composers be considered for commissioning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications are then submitted to the Australian Council for partial funding. Several of these applications have not been successful, and ABC Concerts is seeking other means of funding these commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The programming and performance of a work requires a lengthy planning period. It is necessary, firstly, to find a suitable programming "slot" for a work, and conductor and soloist who are willing to learn the new work. In the case of commission, the lead-time is even longer. It is common that there may be an interval of two or three years between commissioning and performance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In past years, provisional taxpayers who were not subject to the quarterly system were notified of their provisional tax on their notice of assessment. From this year, provisional tax is being notified separately. This means that taxpayers who pay provisional tax and who have excess credits at the time of their assessment will get a refund. A refund arises where there is an excess of credits (including provisional credit, prescribed payments system credits, and tax instalment deductions) over the taxpayer's primary tax assessed. Previously, this refund would have been automatically credited against provisional tax notified to the taxpayer that was not yet due and payable. Taxpayers who are due a refund will now have use of that money until any provisional tax debt is due and payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications for the revenue cash flow are that the refunds will be issued when the income tax returns are assessed and payments of the provisional tax will be due no earlier than 31 March 1995. Previously the two amounts were combined and any amount still payable was due no earlier than 31 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These particular refunds and payments are not separately identified, the refunds paid are included in Individuals Refunds and the payments are included in Gross Other Individuals collections. As stated in Budget Paper No.1 of the Budget Statements 1994-95, the full year impact of this change is estimated to increase both gross collections for other individuals and refunds for individuals by around $550 million in 1994-95.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation (LWRRDC) has not identified areas of Australia's rangelands as being unviable for pastoral production. LWRRDC Occasional Paper 06/93 "R&amp;D for Sustainable Use and Management of Australia's Rangelands", however, sets out the proceedings of a national workshop involving representatives of the grazing industries, Aboriginal and conservation organisations, researchers and policy makers to identify opportunities and priorities for rangelands research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This included a report by D Wilcox and G Cunningham on the "Economic and Ecological Sustainability of Current Land Use in Australia's Rangelands". Financial data in this paper showed the strong performance of much of the northern beef industry, and the difficult situation faced by many wool producers in southern pastoral areas. While these results supported earlier reviews undertaken by State governments, it should be noted that there is wide variability in financial performance between producers within any one region. Since that report there has been a lift in wool prices, but high debt levels continue to be a significant factor in the economic performance of some wool enterprises in the rangelands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has been involved in a number of studies examining conditions in Australia's rangelands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A National Rangelands Strategy is being developed that could provide a strategic basis for the assessment and adjustment process in the sensitive arid areas of the country. The Strategy is being developed jointly by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand and the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council. The Joint Working Group of the above two Ministerial Councils which has government, grazier, Aboriginal, environmental and CSIRO representation has undertaken a public consultation process and is currently developing rangeland goals. The Strategy will be completed in 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Funding for the Rural Adjustment Scheme regional initiatives will be drawn from the Commonwealth Rural Adjustment Scheme reserve. The reserve was established in the 1994-95 Budget context to provide funding for RAS regional initiatives and as a basis for smoothing between year (and between State) variations in demand for assistance and/or fund specific productivity improvement measures. Funding for the reserve is derived from underspends from normal RAS.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There has been no specific action to implement the Labor Party policy to protect the Ramsar listed wetlands as national parks and nature reserves. The Federal Government continues to work co-operatively with the State and Territory Governments to ensure better management of Ramsar sites and other wetlands. For example, through the National Wetlands Program in 1994-95, the Federal Government has allocated a total of $585 000 to assist with wetland management issues, including the development of management plans for Ramsar sites.</PARA>

I have been advised that the majority of Ramsar sites in Tasmania that provide suitable habitat for waterfowl, including Logan Lagoon, Moulting Lagoon and Orielton Lagoon are closed or partly closed to shooting on a permanent basis. Other Tasmanian Ramsar sites are privately owned and shooting is often prohibited or at least restricted by the owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am aware that lead contamination has been identified at Moulting Lagoon Game Reserve and the Apsley Marshes. The Tasmanian Government prepared a status report on Ramsar sites within its jurisdiction for inclusion in the National Report for the Fifth Conference of Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention in 1993. The report outlined action undertaken by the Tasmanian Government to rehabilitate Moulting Lagoon. Tasmania also advised that a study into the occurrence and uptake of lead shot within Ramsar sites is being carried out. Results from this study are yet to be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1994-95, the National Wetlands Program is providing funds ($24,760) to the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service to prepare management plans for all ten Ramsar sites in Tasmania.

Tasmania is considering prohibiting the use of lead shot in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Under the Ramsar Convention the Federal Government has obligations to ensure that listed wetlands are managed so as to maintain their ecological character. Where listed wetlands occur within the jurisdiction of a State or Territory Government, that Government is responsible for ensuring Australia's obligations are met under the Ramsar Convention. Such an arrangement is consistent with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with land and resource management, primary responsibility for wildlife management lies with the State and Territory Governments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is signatory to a number of other international treaties and agreements concerned with the protection of migratory species of birds. The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also known as CMS or as the Bonn Convention) aims to secure the conservation of endangered or threatened species which undergo cyclic and predictable migrations across one or more national boundaries. As with the Ramsar Convention, implementation of CMS in Australia is the purview of the State and Territory Governments, consistent with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 6 December 1994 the Minister for Communications and the Arts tabled a report by AUSTEL on the Optus Vision and Telstra ("MOCO") broadband joint venture proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AUSTEL found that, in principle, the two proposals were similar, in that the cable network would be installed by a licensed carrier but would be owned and operated by a service provider who would in turn provide pay television carriage to a licensed broadcaster and telephony carriage back to the licensed carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, AUSTEL found that the two proposals differed in the provision of broadband services. Optus Vision intended to exclusively provide broadband telecommunications services (for example, multimedia) directly to customers. Under the MOCO proposal, broadband services were to be provided by both Telstra and MOCO itself: Telstra would provide broadband services which were interactive multimedia or non-entertainment home and business services and MOCO would provide broadband services with limited interactivity (such as home shopping, betting and games).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AUSTEL reported that there would be an asymmetric regulatory arrangement between Optus Networks and Telstra for broadband services under the Optus Vision proposal. If Telstra were to offer such services, it would be obliged to offer interconnection to Optus Networks and hence to Optus Vision customers. However, Telstra would have no right to interconnect to the Optus Vision network and hence such access could be denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also identified a potential difference in the provision of pay television services. While Optus Vision intended to provide pay television carriage exclusively to Multicom (a pay television licensee under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992), MOCO had, at the time of finalising the report, yet to confirm whether it intended to offer similar exclusivity to PAYCO (also a pay television licensee)&mdash;that is, there was a possibility that MOCO could offer carriage to other licensed broadcasters as service providers under Part 10 of the Telecommunications Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) AUSTEL found that the different arrangements in regard to provision of broadband services had the potential to impact adversely on competition. It supported the view that equitable interconnection arrangements are necessary for the development of broadband services and considered it essential that the Government's policy commitment to equitable interconnection arrangements should apply in this newly developing sector of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 November 1994, the Minister announced that the Government would act to ensure that broadband services are subject to the relevant access provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1991. He said that he would issue a direction to AUSTEL to ensure that service providers would have access to broadband cable for the provision of telephony and broadband services. For pay television use of cable, there would be an exemption from this access regime until at least 1 July 1997. The Department of Communications and the Arts is currently undertaking public consultation on a draft direction.</PARA>
