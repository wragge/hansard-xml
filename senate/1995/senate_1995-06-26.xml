<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the selective leaks of your cabinet submission regarding the French tests over the weekend and your radio comments today that you had `an absolutely clear conscience in terms of what I put to cabinet'&mdash;all designed to demonstrate that the `tickle my tummy' response of the government was not your fault and with the implication that the real lack of leadership and judgment lies not at your feet but those of the Prime Minister. In order that the Australian people might apportion blame and to be fair to the Prime Minister after your weekend briefings, will you now table your cabinet submission? Will you explain why cabinet did not resolve to send a delegation to France before the announcement of President Chirac when there was just a chance that it might have done some good?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Either what goes to cabinet or what is discussed there. And that remains my position; it always has been my position. The processes that cabinet went through, as always, were collective processes and, as always, they are being implemented with the collective support of all members of the cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular package of decisions that we reached as to an initial response the first time round was perfectly appropriate and proportionate to the nature of the problem as we then perceived it to be, as was the government's response at all levels. In subsequent developments as they occurred, which we foreshadowed at the time of the original announcement with the Prime Minister foreshadowing a South Pacific island consultation process, with me foreshadowing a process of direct communication with the French, as those events took place and further unfolded, cabinet decided, collectively again, that it was appropriate to go down a further path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our conscience, my conscience, is perfectly clear on the particular contributions that I have made at all stages to this particular process. What I ought to be asking of the opposition is how its conscience is on this particular matter. Haven't we had enough hypocrisy and opportunism from those opposite?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I and the Labor Party were marching for nuclear disarmament all those years ago, the coalition was demanding more and bigger bombs. When I and the Labor Party were marching against Vietnam, the opposition was supporting a bloody and indefensible war to the last conscript. When the Labor government was putting in place the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty, the coalition was arguing against that, saying that it would offend the United States, that it would offend France, that it would be wrong in principle, the wrong treaty at the wrong time. The member for Mayo, the now shadow foreign minister, said that the problem with the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty was that, basically, it was an anti-French treaty and nothing else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was busting my guts out all last year and before with a first-class team of Australian diplomats to get the NPT, the  non-proliferation treaty, indefinitely extended, the opposition was railing against treaties of all kinds, saying that they limited and undermined Australia's sovereignty. When I and my party were wrestling with the great dilemma of whether and how we should be selling uranium to ensure that it would only be used for peaceful purposes, that it would not despoil the environment, the coalition's only concern was for the profits of the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I am wrestling now, as I am, with how to recover something by a mixture of protest and persuasion from the wreckage of a very bad decision by the French government&mdash;bad for the NPT, bad for the CTBT, bad for the people of the South Pacific&mdash;all the opposition can do is try again to score cheap political points, hoping that people will forget its abominable record on everything to do with nuclear issues that any of them had to do with these issues since they came into public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people have longer memories and better memories than the opposition thinks. They will not forget the role the coalition has played over so many decades in nuclear policy. What I and the Labor Party have been religiously pursuing all these years is a three-fold policy on nuclear matters: first, to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries via the non-proliferation treaty; secondly, to stop the development of new generations of weapons by a comprehensive test ban that would ban all testing for all time; and, thirdly, to work for the total elimination of existing nuclear stockpiles. The opposition, the coalition, its individual members, including those who are waxing hypocritical and indignant at the moment, have never worked for any of those objectives. They have never believed in any of them.</PARA>

The letter was a natural further development of that. We had some discussions as to whether I should write a letter as well, covering that particular territory to Monsieur Juppe or to my counterpart, but it was decided that it would be most effective, since I had only spoken to those people a couple of weeks earlier, for the Prime Minister to write. So that was the immediate, pre-emptive action that we took.</PARA></TALK.START>

We made accordingly a cabinet decision to anticipate a response that would be an appropriate initial response. That is what happened, and as the situation further developed we took a further course of action through direct contact by me with the foreign minister by phone and through direct contact with the delegation, by me again in Paris with South Pacific Islanders. In response to our inability to move the French on the basic issues, we have taken further action now. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<QUESTION PAGE="1718" SPEAKER="Wheelwright Sen T.C." NAMEID="RC6" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RC6">Senator WHEELWRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I note that the historic Accord Mark VIII `Sustaining Growth, Low Inflation and Fairness' was agreed by the government and the ACTU last Thursday. Could the minister inform the Senate of the outcomes from this Accord, and what are the implications for Australia's economic outlook?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1718" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table Accord Mark VIII `Sustaining Growth, Low Inflation and Fairness'. I table as well a joint statement by the Prime Minister and the President of the ACTU issued on 22 June on the Accord. I think the best way of answering the question from Senator Wheelwright is to quote from the joint statement. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new agreement, Accord Mark VIII, will provide a framework for another four years of low inflation, high productivity, high growth and sustained falls in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It continues the tradition of underpinning industrial harmony and social justice with an ongoing process of industrial relations and workplace reform and the move to decentralised wage fixing based upon an effective award safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The eighth Accord between the Government and the ACTU is proof that the relationship works and has resulted in the most successful social, economic and industrial relations partnership anywhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>The strength and efficacy of the Accord relationship is demonstrated, I believe, by the comprehensive nature of the shared objectives pursued by the Accord. They are: sustainable economic growth; a minimum of 600,000 jobs target during the course of the Accord; a commitment to five per cent unemployment being within reach of the government by the end of the decade; a low underlying inflation rate of two per cent to three per cent on average over the economic cycle to ensure continued economic prosperity; continued micro-economic reform and workplace reform; greatly increased national savings to provide a better retirement income for all workers; and an adequate social wage and a commitment to sustainable real wages growth to improve the living standards of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Accord includes the four safety net wage increases comprising the third $8 a week agreed in the previous Accord and three annual adjustments of $9 to $12 available at the award level. For low paid workers the range will be $11 to $14 a week annual increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parties are strongly committed to the extension of enterprise bargaining to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, productivity and competitiveness of workplaces in Australia. That commitment is there in detail; it is there in black and white. I can only assume that those who have criticised the productivity elements of the Accord have not read page 4 of the Accord document which makes this very plain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this is unambiguous good news for the economy, business and the workplace. It is in sharp contrast to the old-style confrontationalist approach that the opposition still clings to in its harkings back to Jobsback, one of the most regressive social documents ever to be entered into in the Australian industrial relations debate. I believe the opposition is just incapable of understanding the benefits of working with rather than against the Australian work force. It has opposed all wage increases since 1983, and it has rejected socially innovative projects to assist the most disadvantaged. It still clings to greater expenditure cuts which would be regressive and destructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Accord has served Australia well. This is another instalment on that path, another milestone in social cooperative behaviour in order to deliver fundamental economic change to Australia and to bring about prosperity to Australians wherever they are&mdash;and fairly and equally.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the Accord has achieved a massive reduction in strike activity, an ongoing level of high industrial growth and a major cut in inflation from 11.3 per cent down to what is now the ruling level of inflation underlying rate, 1.9 per cent. It has achieved a higher disposable household income per capita in Australia of about 38 per cent, and it has achieved a degree of consensus finding and social harmony necessary to build a competitive world economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other statistics one can quote about the Accord. Perhaps its most enduring achievement has been to end warfare in the workplace, and bring about cooperation in building a more competitive economy in Australia by working with workers on the basis of mutual respect and understanding and capturing their innovative contribution to employment growth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I note from reading this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> your extremely precious comment that you find it totally offensive to suggest you may have put personal interest ahead of the national interest. I also note your claim that any UN resolution condemning the French action would provoke a strong reaction from the French and the francophone states, presumably the very purpose of Senator Faulkner's suggestion. Doesn't your determination to roll over on the one proposal which might galvanise the French into some constructive action make it abundantly clear that you simply do not want to alienate a potentially very powerful support base? Given your obvious and massive conflict of interest on this fundamental issue, why will you not rule yourself out for United Nations Secretary-General, a position which must in any event be a very long shot, or is it the fact that your constant globetrotting, broken only by reluctant returns to question time, has caused you to lose sight of the political woods for the diplomatic trees?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I do find it totally offensive any suggestion that there is a conflict of interest here that would lead me to place any personal conceivable interest ahead of my perception of Australia's national interest. I not only find it totally offensive; it is totally inaccurate on all available evidence as anyone who knows me or knows the circumstances of my involvement in this whole process from the outset knows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the particular question, I am happy to answer any specific question you put to me; but if you put snide, sneering, defamatory innuendo like that, I can only respond in this way. Your question is totally without foundation, it is totally offensive, it is totally defamatory and it is totally at odds with everything I have stood for in the conduct of this position in the seven years that I have occupied it. As to what it might be possible to pursue in the General Assembly or, for that matter, any of the other multilateral agencies or forums within the UN system or alongside it, that is a matter we are keeping under very close review, and seeing what might be possible in each one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about a full scale, full-on resolution sought to be initiated in the General Assembly is that it would most likely not succeed&mdash;not get up. It is not that it would not get up anyone's nostrils, of course it would, but it might not succeed in being passed at all, because of the combination of forces. From our knowledge of the way these places work&mdash;I bow to Senator Alston's superior knowledge of the dynamics of these situations&mdash;and from the advice available to me, it is more likely than not that there would be a combination of European, Francophone and nuclear weapons states' resources lined up against us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, to the extent that any such resolution would need to address the problem of Chinese testing as well, because there is no moral, practical or political distinction between those two, you have a great deal of difficulty in mobilising&mdash;on all past experience&mdash;sufficiently large majorities to carry the day or, at least, to carry it without so many abstentions that the whole exercise is seen as a failure. It is a matter of judgment that you have to make at each step of the way, before you embark upon such exercises, as to what is likely to be productive and what is likely to be either unproductive or counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had such an exercise mounted a few years ago in relation to New Caledonia. You would not remember, Senator Alston, because you do not take any notice of these things except when they involve vulgar opportunities to point score. In the New Caledonia exercise the vote was won, but with so small a margin with so many abstentions, as I recall, that it was seen as a hollow and empty exercise, and one that rebounded upon its promoters. That is part of the difficulty you have to be cognisant of when making these judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many opportunities to make statements. There may well be opportunities to attach clauses to other resolutions that are going through various agencies. I certainly do not absolutely rule out the possibility of doing something in the General Assembly. That is one of the things we are going to keep under very close review as we see how this situation evolves in the next few weeks and months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our object is to try to get change, hopefully in the basic French policy and, beyond that, to bed down the commitment of the nuclear weapons states to signing the comprehensive test ban we have been working ourselves into the ground for, for so long&mdash;to your sublime and profound indifference&mdash;to get some change in terms of French commitment to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, to get France to commit itself to closing Mururoa, and to get all the rest of the things that are part of the battery of proposals and propositions we have been putting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the context in which that discussion is taking place. It does not in any way reflect a desire on my part to avoid causing offence to anybody. On occasion, that is part of what is absolutely necessary to get a point across. I am sure the measures we passed last week&mdash;which amount to the most significant that I can recall of any country imposing against any other country, with which it normally has friendly relations, in a peacetime environment&mdash;will have certainly got that message across. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I presume, when you headed off to France, Senator Evans, rather than coming to question time last week, that you did not expect to carry the day. In other words, it was a gesture. I presume that you do not seriously expect some of the things you have frantically tried to do in the last few days to cause the French to change their behaviour over the next weeks and months. In other words, you have made gestures. So what is wrong with a gesture in the United Nations General Assembly, where you cannot have a binding resolution but, nonetheless, you can make very clear Australia's position? You would not be taking a measured response or simply waiting until the issue has gone off the boil; you would not be keeping the matter under review. You would be showing that you are fair dinkum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a difference between a gesture and an empty gesture. There is a difference between a gesture that is productive and effectively conveys the symbolic force of a particular position and a gesture which backfires on you because you do not have the numbers to get it up and you just demonstrate the weakness of your position in the international community. Even Senator Alston would have the intelligence to understanding that distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I went to France last week, it was in pursuit of two objectives. Firstly, it was to convey a protest of a fundamental and serious kind on behalf of the whole South Pacific Forum and to make that clear across the table eyeball to eyeball. Secondly, it was to engage in an exercise in persuasion. It was to persuade them, if humanly possible, to wind back the tests to which they had already committed themselves. If that was going to be impossible, it was to at least persuade them to put on the record commitments to a decent test ban treaty, not just empty rhetoric, commitments to signing the Rarotonga treaty, not standing outside it, and commitments to closing Mururoa. If you do not think that was a useful way for me to spend my time, a useful way for me to represent the government and people of Australia, or a useful way for me to represent the people of the South Pacific, your judgment is as bad as your political morality. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to you, Mr President. The UN's credibility and effectiveness have been questioned as a result of recent setbacks to its efforts to promote peace, particularly in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda. Some have even queried, sensibly, why we should bother with the UN for another 50 years. But concentrating on a few extraordinarily difficult situations where the UN Security Council or, for that matter, organisations like the OAU or NATO have not been able to bring a restoration of peace has tended to unfairly distort the image of the UN. The seeming impotence of UN peace keepers in Sarajevo or Mogadishu should be set against the UN's wider record in peacekeeping, with operations that have been very successful in recent years, like those in Namibia, Cambodia, Mozambique and, more recently still, Haiti.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in operations such as UNPROFOR in Bosnia, UNOSOM in Somalia or UNIMIR in Rwanda there have been obviously significant humanitarian benefits delivered as a result of the UN's efforts and the efforts of contingents like the Australians, who participated so bravely and effectively in their efforts in Kibuye, Kigali, and right around Rwanda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN's peace operations are really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the UN's international role. Its work in promoting cooperation to alleviate poverty, to assist the social and economic development of less developed countries and to protect human rights and basic individual freedoms receives much less attention, largely because the work involved requires quiet persistence over many years rather than noisy reportable flourishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This broader role for the UN had its origins in debate in San Francisco in 1946, when the Australian delegation led by Doc Evatt led the way in pressing for a mandate for the UN to promote economic and social cooperation. Part of the article's undertaking, which requires member states to pledge themselves to take joint and separate action to achieve such goals as higher standards of living and the like, came to be known as the Australian pledge. As a nation, we are inclined to undervalue some of our achievements, but this is one that should not be undervalued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of that provision and others like them in the charter, the UN and its specialised agencies have been in the front line confronting the world's silent emergencies of hunger, ill-health, repression, dispossession and exile. The sad fact is that this task, which has improved the lives of millions of people around the world, rarely meets television's compulsive need for 30-second grabs. I believe that this work does have the strong support of all Australians and should continue to receive it in the decades ahead.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware, of course, of the comments made by Major-General Mantiri&mdash;as he then was&mdash;during a magazine interview in July 1992, including his remark that the November 1991 massacre in Dili was bound to happen and was not a cause for regret. Upon hearing of those remarks at the time, I immediately instructed Australia's then Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr Phillip Flood, to make representations to the Indonesian government conveying our deep disappointment and extreme regret over the remarks. Mr Flood raised that matter with Foreign Minister Alatas, noting that the comments were very regrettable and inconsistent with the expressions of regret that had been made by President Soeharto himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Major-General Mantiri's remarks were unquestionably extremely regrettable&mdash;and that is being very diplomatically polite&mdash;it is a different matter to say that they disqualify him from appointment as Indonesia's ambassador to Australia. The situation is this: it has only been in very extreme situations that have been very rare in Australia's diplomatic history that agrement is withheld; it is only when we consider&mdash;and this is normal international practice&mdash;a nominee to be so personally and/or so professionally unsuitable as to be incapable of enabling a productive bilateral relationship to be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, in deciding not to withhold agrement for General Mantiri, we took into account three considerations. First, there has never been any suggestion that General Mantiri had any personal involvement in the Dili shootings. In fact, at the time of the November 1991 massacre he was Assistant for Planning and Budgeting to the Chief of Army Staff in Jakarta. Secondly, General Mantiri is very well qualified for the job in the sense that he has risen to the highest level of his profession in Indonesia, is well and favourably known to many in government in Australia, particularly in defence, and has visited this country many times. Thirdly, the ambassadorship to Australia is regarded in Jakarta as an extremely important post. General Mantiri was the personal choice of President Soeharto for the job, and there would clearly be major implications for our bilateral relationship&mdash;bearing in mind the standard practice that has been applied about agrement principles in the past&mdash;if we denied it in this instance.</PARA>

In all the circumstances, the government felt that there was no other course that could be taken, although obviously we are concerned that it was possible on even one occasion for someone to make so ill-guided and so ill-judged a set of remarks as that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans. I refer to your statement to the Review and Extension Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in April of this year when you predicted that `negotiations on the comprehensive test ban treaty are far advanced and most likely to be concluded this year'. Firstly, do you now accept that Australia's refusal to push for strengthened disarmament measures at the disarmament conference, including a commitment to weapons reduction targets, was based on an unrealistic assessment of the willingness of the nuclear weapons states to meet their existing Article VI commitments? Secondly, will Australia's position leading up to the negotiation for the CTBT and the 1997 nuclear non-proliferation treaty preparatory committee meeting be reviewed in the light of the French and Chinese nuclear testing and the United States prevarication about the level of testing that should be permitted under a comprehensive test ban treaty?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is more to be said on that subject, perhaps on another occasion. The truth of the matter is that Australia's position on the NPT renewal exercise was one of the most carefully considered and hardest fought for of any country participating in that treaty and most successful in terms of producing the outcome that we all&mdash;with the exception, I know, of the Greens&mdash;actually wanted: indefinite extension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way that indefinite extension could reach agreement and, effectively, unanimous support, as it did, was by the non-nuclear weapons states being satisfied that some pretty serious constraints had been accepted by the nuclear weapons states&mdash;in particular, so far as a much-strengthened review process was concerned, in terms of measuring their performance by reference to their Article VI obligations; and, secondly, by a quite substantial set of principles and guidelines and objectives being laid out as to what needed to happen next, not least a very strong commitment being made to a comprehensive test ban treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-proliferation by itself only goes so far. What is absolutely crucial is the need to stop new generations of weapons being tested by all tests being banned for all time. That has been an essential Australian foreign policy objective for as long as this government has been in power&mdash;it certainly was not under the previous lot&mdash;and we have been pursuing it assiduously and effectively. There is no reason to change any of the negotiating positions that we have been supporting. We wanted that CTBT to be negotiated this year rather than next year. We thought at one stage&mdash;optimistically&mdash;earlier this year that might have been possible. What we did succeed in doing was getting a commitment, which had not hitherto been on the record at all, from most of the nuclear weapons states: firstly, to sign a CTBT, and, secondly, to do it by a finite date; that is to say, by next year. So they were major achievements, and now those achievements have got to be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your other question was about what we are doing with the United States to stop it resuming testing. There is no pressure or mood within any segment of the United States government to resume nuclear testing as such. The only argument that you have been reading about in the last week or so is an argument within sections of the US administration as to what the sub-threshold test level ought to be. Most people have acknowledged that it is difficult, because of verification problems and all the rest of it, to have an absolutely zero limit; although, ideally, that is Australia's preferred position&mdash;that is what should be in the treaty document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a suggestion, for example, from the US that explosions of the order of two kilograms worth of TNT ought to be permissible as part of an exercise in stockpile stewardship. Other countries, nuclear weapons states, have been arguing for larger thresholds&mdash;including in the case of France, I understand, up to 300 to 500 tonnes worth of explosive potential, which is pretty extraordinary and hard to even begin to think of as not constituting a nuclear test, even though 500 tonnes is still only one-twentieth the size of the minimal explosion we have been used to at Muroroa and elsewhere, which has been in the range of 10 kilotons up to 100 kilotons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US argument was all about what that threshold should be. It does seem that that argument has been very much resolved in favour of the commitment to stay right down at the lower end of that scale. That is a healthy development, one that we welcome and one that we will continue to pursue and push very hard indeed. There is no ground whatsoever for believing that the United States is even thinking of resuming any testing proper. That is just not on the agenda. It has not been, and it certainly will not be under this administration, I am fully confident.</PARA>

That is what he said and that is certainly the context in which I think when I think of small-scale possible exemptions. Anything much more than that&mdash;certainly, anything in the range of 300 to 500 tonnes&mdash;would be totally and comprehensively unacceptable. It would be inconceivable that we could support that and we will certainly be sending an expert mission around the place to argue very vigorously against that. We have a great deal of respect and credibility on those sorts of issues, which is utterly unshared on your side of the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the particular question about what is likely to happen, it is not a matter of acknowledging any virtue at all in the French position. Obviously, what the French have done has been to bring the NPT and the CTBT process into a great deal of difficulty and anxiety for those of us who are concerned to maintain it because they have lost credibility. But at least it can be argued that they have modified their position on the question of threshold tests and it might be possible to get a lower number out of them than was otherwise the case.

At the time of the Howard treasurership under the Fraser government, inflation was at 11.4 per cent or more. When you subtract our low level of inflation from the level of interest rates, okay, you get a little figure there that will delight you, but the truth is that if the comparison is between real interest rates under you and under us, in the wider landscape of the economy, under your government, under your tenure of the Treasury benches, we had high levels of interest, we had high levels of inflation of 11.3 per cent and better, we had massive unemployment of over 10 per cent, and we had negative economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part of Senator Abetz's question asked whether or not the government would dissociate itself from the comments of the Governor-General. Senator Abetz must understand that those comments were personal comments of the Governor-General and have absolutely nothing to do with government. That is the first thing that needs to be said. The Governor-General's comments were part of a public debate on this issue, but they have nothing to do with the government. So the government is not required one way or another to dissociate itself from those comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the question of euthanasia in this country certainly has considerably more weight in that community debate because of the legislation passed by the Northern Territory parliament. There is no doubt at all that there is a change in the community sentiment of whether or not this matter should be discussed. In fact, I think it is now in the public domain for debate like it previously never was. I think that is largely because of the actions of the Northern Territory government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I cannot tell Senator Abetz reliably what the polling shows, but there is a very significant sympathy in the community not because people want to choose euthanasia for themselves but because they do not want to prevent other people, if they make that decision honourably and properly, from perhaps acting on it. In other words, there is some sympathy in the community for the decision of the Northern Territory government. There is also considerable weight against it. To the extent that it is relevant at all to the Commonwealth government, I think we should recognise that it is a matter for state and territory governments and/or community debate.</PARA>

But I think the hint in Senator Abetz's words that maybe aged people will be frightened or discriminated against is, firstly, to misunderstand, as I understand it, what the Northern Territory legislation on euthanasia is about and, secondly, to whip up concern and anxiety for aged people in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the meeting of the Small Business Forum held here in Canberra last Friday there was an excellent outcome for the forum and for the government over the issue of unconscionable conduct&mdash;an issue that has been debated in the small business community for many years. I have previously placed it on the agenda to get an opinion of whether the small business interests in this country&mdash;there were some 34 small organisations represented&mdash;would give an indication of support that section 51AA of the Trade Practices Act, called the unconscionable conduct section, could be amended to strengthen and give better economic redress to small business in Australia, vis a vis dealings with big business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report was given by a working party recommending that yes, the act be amended and strengthened accordingly. There was a lengthy discussion. Overwhelmingly, those organisations present recommended in favour of amending the act. Three or four organisations had already gone on the public record showing some concern about the change&mdash;unfortunately, they had not looked at all the issues, in my view&mdash;and they were: the ACCI, VECCI from Victoria, the Australian Bankers Association and, of course, the Law Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, we reached an agreement where three of those four organisations did not oppose the subsequent resolution moved by the forum. But, in the end, the bankers still opposed any change to unconscionable conduct. I warned them that I thought it was an unfair scare campaign, but they said that any change to unconscionable conduct would weaken contract law in Australia. I said, `The only thing you haven't accused us of doing in looking at changes in this area is saying that this will be the end of christianity or motherhood.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long in this country small business has been at a disadvantage in contract law in dealing with big business. The government is now trying to address this so that there is an even-handed approach. But the Bankers Association is still opposing any change&mdash;and they wonder why they have a poor reputation in the small business community in Australia. Friday's opposition to the change was an example of why. The forum passed the following resolution:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forum expresses its concern at the ineffectiveness of the unconscionable conduct provision of the Trade Practices Act and encourages the government to strengthen measures against unconscionable conduct. The forum looks forward to contributing to the debate on the most appropriate way in which to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>I indicated to the small business organisations that we would have further consultation with them on the actual wording and preparation of a cabinet submission on an appropriate amendment to 51AA, and those discussions are already well under way with them and with other government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to briefly mention that at the small business coalition dinner the night before, when I indicated my support, Judi Moylan, the shadow minister, stood up and said that she did not want to deal with the issue of unconscionable conduct, it was too difficult to deal with, she did not have a view about it and she hoped that I would be able to deal with it as a minister and resolve the issue before there was a change of government because she did not want to deal with it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article starts by referring to `disgraced West Australian Liberal power-broker Noel Crichton-Browne'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The behind-the-scenes manoeuvres which blocked Crichton-Browne's political resurrection demonstrates the extent to which the West Australian Liberal numbers' man remains focused on propping up his own power base at the expense of the interests of the federal party and Howard's prospects of victory.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That pollster is one of the most sophisticated, well regarded pollsters in Australia. We all know that in Australia voters tend to vote for what is in their best interests, not the high, moral, altruistic ground. It would be the view of every single sophisticated pollster in this country that, had I insisted on remaining number one, irremovable, irrevocably elected number one and unable to be moved, at the time of the election that three per cent would have dissipated into absolutely nothing. The contest was clearly going to be between the two leaders and their competing policies. However, I stepped down because I judged, in the short term, that it was likely to cause internal problems for the party. The article goes on, in a rather obscure way which defies my understanding, to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it also reveals the emergence of a group of senior Liberals around Howard whose determination to win now sees them prepared to ruthlessly chop off anybody who threatens those prospects.</PARA>
<PARA>No doubt Mr Milne will tell us what it means, but it means absolutely nothing to me, although I will say that if I had chosen to stay No. 1 I would be No. 1 today, and nothing could have changed that. I will go to the next paragraph in the article of relevance to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the party by convincing Crichton-Browne to stand down as the number-one Senate ticket-holder following revelations that Crichton-Browne had been the subject of a domestic violence restraining order from his wife.</PARA>

I can say no more than that for the time being because&mdash;in the same way I asked the Commonwealth police not to disclose that I was the person who had complained about allegations which required them to visit my office on Friday of last week&mdash;I will wait and carry the burden of that matter until such time as due process takes place and those involved in misdemeanours, criminal offences and improper conduct are dealt with. If that means that I have to wear it for the time being, so I shall. The article then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite knowing that Crichton-Browne was adamant about embarking on a course of action that could have torpedoed Howard&mdash;perhaps fatally&mdash;it appears that no West Australian MP put pressure on Crichton-Browne to reconsider.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say about that is that it was a very wise course of action on the part of my colleagues. The article goes on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those around Howard were aghast. They decided Crichton-Browne had to be stopped. This critical task fell to John Moore. A Liberal frontbencher and former Queensland Liberal State president...</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on to say how Moore was a minister in the Fraser government who in some obscure, obscene way was required to step aside over some matter relating to a colour television set when he was, as I recall those days, no more than the minister for customs.

<PARA>I have already referred to the research done thus far. It is with some modesty that I remind at least my side of parliament that I had the dubious distinction of playing a prominent part in Richard Court's last campaign. It was the best conservative vote the Liberal Party in Western Australia had received since Federation. We won six out of 10 Senate spots. On the last occasion we held eight out of 14 federal seats.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not embarrass my colleagues by going seat by seat into how we did it and the price I paid to make sure that we won the Mount Helena by-election recently.

If every other state in Australia got our result in Western Australia, Senator Gareth Evans would be on this side, in the High Court or somewhere else. The rest of his colleagues would be scattered to the four winds looking for new jobs, new hopes, new ambitions and a new source of income.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put on the record&mdash;I do not often say these things&mdash;something about the finances of the party in Western Australia. This will salivate Senator Gareth Evans. We are the second most affluent Liberal Party of any state in Australia. When I had the dubious distinction of being the state president, we had more financial members than any political party in any state in Australia.

The Joint House Department is the department responsible for the provision of emergency first-aid and other health care services through the Nurses Centre. An evaluation of the Nurses Centre was carried out by the Joint House Department in 1994. This evaluation followed on from advice received from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on the proper organisation of occupational health and safety within Parliament House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This short statement is about the non-tabling of declarations under the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 and the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our finding that, by administrative oversight, guidelines under the Industrial Research and Development Act had not been tabled in the parliament as required, I directed my department to investigate the status of all legal instruments which it has responsibility for administering. I was determined to ascertain whether any other similar oversights had occurred so that, if they had, they could be rectified quickly. My department has accordingly been engaged in a systematic check of all such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday evening, 23 June 1995, my department informed me that further matters involving the non-tabling of ministerial declarations under two bounty acts have been identified. Bounty legislation is administered within my portfolio jointly by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and the Australian Customs Service. Ministerial declarations extend eligibility for bounty to equipment not covered by the definitions in the acts and, in this sense, to cases at the margin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matters identified involve 21 declarations, made between May 1985 and February 1993 under Section 5 of the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984, which have not been tabled in the parliament. Since that time, only one other declaration has been made under that act. This declaration was gazetted on 30 November 1994, and tabled in the Senate on 7 December 1994 and in the House of Representatives on 6 February 1995 in accordance with the requirement of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, 12 declarations made between 1987 and 1991 under the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985 have not been tabled in the parliament. In 1991, the act was amended and, subject to confirmations by the Attorney-General's Department, it appears that all but two of the changes have been incorporated into the legislation. No declarations have been made since 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the main, the declarations conferred a benefit to producers of certain goods, which would otherwise not be eligible for bounty. One declaration made in May 1987, in respect of the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985, was made to exclude certain equipment from the definition of bountiable goods but its effect was specific and limited to one particular piece of plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although my portfolio is unable to be definitive, short of an exhaustive check of all files going back over a number of years, it has advised that for both acts the declarations in question relate to a minority of cases. More importantly, what is in question is the proper processing of the declarations, not the appropriateness of the decisions to extend bounty in accordance with the purposes of the acts. I and my portfolio are therefore determined to rectify the effects of the oversight to restore certainty to these matters as quickly as possible. Indeed, while ACS could in principle seek recovery for payments made under invalid declarations, there is no intention to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My department has sought advice urgently from the Attorney-General's Department on the effects of the non-tabling and appropriate remedies to give the intentions of the declarations proper legal force. The preliminary advice of the Attorney-General's Department is that legislation will be necessary to validate the declarations made. Final advice is expected shortly, and I propose to have appropriate legislation drafted and introduced into the parliament for earliest possible passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the administrative oversights themselves: I have instructed the Secretary to my department and the chief executive officer of the Australian Customs Service to review what has happened and to make recommendations to ensure that a similar failure does not happen again. It is apparent already that a key cause of these oversights was that staff administering these acts were not aware of the need to table as well as gazette the declarations. This circumstance is very similar to the problem relating to the IR&amp;D guidelines but, to be certain, I have instructed the Secretary to my department and the chief executive officer of the ACS to extend the inquiry conducted in relation to the IR&amp;D finance guidelines to these matters as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed Legislative Instruments Bill, which will require registration of all legal instruments with the Office of Legislative Drafting, will clearly strengthen existing procedures by providing a procedural trigger in such cases. I have conveyed to the agencies my deep concern that these oversights have occurred and have not been rectified over such a considerable period of time. I have also advised them that I am determined that any invalidity is rectified properly and as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My overriding concern is to ensure that firms who should be eligible for bounty and who have been paid bounty are inconvenienced as little as possible. Nevertheless, I have asked that bounty payments in the pipeline not be paid until the legal situation has been clarified. In the meantime, my department's systematic check of legislative instruments and related administrative processes is proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context there is one other matter which I need to mention. Section 39G of the Industrial Research and Development Act requires that the IR&amp;D board determines the grounds on which the registration of registered research agencies can be cancelled and requires that these grounds be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. The guidelines for cancellation of the RRA status are not a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act and therefore are not required to be tabled. It has now been established that guidelines have not been approved by the board and gazetted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the reasons which follow, I and my department do not believe that any party has been disadvantaged, but the department is seeking urgent formal advice from the Attorney-General's Department. Between 22 March 1989 and 21 September 1994 there have been 22 cancellations of RRA status. These fall into three, or possibly four, possible categories. These are: direct request&mdash;10 were at the request of the organisation; ceased operations&mdash;four were found to have ceased operations with written confirmation from either the liquidator or the local Department of Industry, Science and Technology office; amalgamations&mdash;eight were either amalgamated or restructured so that they no longer provided a service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned above, there are none in the fourth category&mdash;cancellations initiated by the department. It appears that all actual cancellations have not resulted in any specific disadvantage to individual RRAs. I hope that no further long-standing administrative problems will emerge, but I cannot be satisfied until every relevant process has been investigated. I and my portfolio are determined that if such problems exist they be identified and fixed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Wheelwright this day, relating to the Prices and Incomes Accord Mark VIII 1995-1999.</PARA>
<PARA>During his answer, Senator Cook eulogised the latest deal done between the government and the ACTU at the expense of most Australians. That deal is commonly known as the Accord Mark VIII. More important than what Senator Cook said was what he did not say. He did not point out that Accord Mark VIII will actually mean real wage cuts to low income earners. A person on the lowest award rate who receives the Accord so-called safety net pay increases, but begins to make employee superannuation contributions in 1998, will in real terms be $8.25 a week worse off by the end of the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Prime Minister Keating and Martin Ferguson of the ACTU announced the deal, they made great play of their intention to protect Australian families and battlers. By taking $8.25 a week from the lowest paid, the Accord actually operates as nothing more than a protection racket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central failure of the Accord&mdash;again, this was not pointed out by the minister&mdash;is the ruling out of any meaningful reform of Minister Brereton's Industrial Relations Act. This is despite the fact that the recent OECD economic survey of Australia noted on page 53:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recognition that higher flexibility and productivity of enterprises can be achieved by moving away from the traditional centrally determined awards system of industrial relations towards increased reliance on bargaining of wages and other work conditions at the company level.</PARA>
<PARA>Rather than making the system more flexible, the Accord this time has marked a return to a centralised approach for significant sectors of the economy. The cost of that to the economy will be considerable. The Business Council of Australia, in its response to the deal between the government and the ACTU, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the whole notion of an Accord shows that the Federal Government is determined to maintain a high degree of centralisation of the Australian wage-fixing system, an approach which is completely out of alignment with the needs of an open economy competing in the global markets of the nineties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the first ten years of Accords&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we have had seven before this and have seen disaster upon disaster during those years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">delivered to Australia was annual productivity growth averaging 1.2 per cent, compared to 1.5 per cent for the rest of the OECD and significantly higher figures for the developing countries to our north . . . The upturn in the last couple of years is more a result of the business cycle than of the Accord process. When we add the non-productive commitments of Accord Mark VIII to the revenue imposts of the recent Federal budget, Australian businesses will be put under more pressure in competing internationally.</PARA>
<PARA>The Accord's statement and the accompanying press releases make no mention of Australia's most pressing economic problem. That pressing economic problem is the fact that Australia has the highest current account deficit, in its balance of payments as a percentage of its national production, in the industrialised world. We are worse off than Mexico. Who could have believed just a few years ago that that could have happened? We have the worst balance of payments deficit in the world, the second highest bank prime interest rate, the second highest real rates of interest, the second highest rate of inflation, massive unemployment despite or because of the first seven accords, savings at a record low in our history, a foreign debt that has gone up about eightfold during the period of this government with its preceding accords, and an Australian dollar that has absolutely plummeted against the other currencies of the world. For the government to say that the Accord will solve those problems which the government has exacerbated in the last few years is absolutely ridiculous. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short demonstrates how little he knows and how little his party knows about how to run a successful wages policy in this country. For a start, let us look at Accord Mark VIII, which is the eighth accord since 1983. One of the hallmarks of this government is that it is one of the very few, if any, governments in the world which has been able to run a successful wages policy alongside a successful social policy throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short referred to what he claimed was a real cut in wages. He referred to the superannuation contribution. He has totally confused the issue. Firstly, it was under an earlier accord that superannuation was introduced for the vast bulk of workers in this country who never had superannuation and were never likely to get it if it was to be left to the conservatives and the employers of this country, by some generous gesture, to extend it as it was extended to those on higher incomes and those in the public service</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Accord Mark VIII does is build upon that very substantial achievement of introducing superannuation for the entire work force of this country, thereby addressing not only the issue of the maintenance of an income after retirement but also the important issue of funding retirement incomes policy in this country. What Accord Mark VIII does is create circumstances whereby employees will be able to contribute to their own future retirement income alongside the contributions made by the employer, and it will be done through the industrial award process rather than just by some legislative instrument. It will be able to be negotiated through the context of the award process, so it is completely incorrect to suggest that it is some sort of a real cut in wages. It is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Accord Mark VIII does, particularly, is carry on the processes that were begun by the trade union movement and the federal government in the early 1980s&mdash;processes which were about creating change in this economy and creating that change whilst maintaining the social fabric, the social wage, that people in this country have for so long been able to enjoy. If you run very quickly through the benefits of that accord process over the last 12 years, you will see, as I said, the introduction of superannuation and the extension of child care and family support systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall when the family allowance supplement was introduced in one of the earlier accords. It represented the equivalent of a $100 per week wage increase for low income earners&mdash;something that, if it had been left to the wage tribunals alone or left simply to employer-employee negotiations, as our opponents would want, would have taken 10 to 20 years to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other accord benefits, of course, were the introduction of enterprise flexibility, enterprise bargaining and, particularly, the establishment of a safety net for those on lower pay. Of course, the opposition does not really believe in a safety net. What it wants to talk about when it talks about industrial relations policy in this country is how to make it easier to sack workers and about so-called unfair dismissal laws. That is where its focus is. It is never on recognising the wage restraint that employees in this country have undergone through the no extra claims provisions&mdash;an essential ingredient of the accords over all of these years&mdash;in order to enable business to have an opportunity to invest in new productive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the commitment of the workers in this country has not been matched by the employers, particularly those members of the Business Council of Australia who wax lyrical about what is required by employees in this country, but who really, except for a few isolated instances, have been not prepared</PARA>

<PARA>It points out that the deaths started between 22 and 23 March. The task force was not set up until 10 May. It points to the enormous difficulties under which this task force has been operating. Interestingly, when one turns to the section on virology, we read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Viral-like cytopathic effect (CPE) has been observed in cultures inoculated with processed gill or kidney/liver/spleen tissues from pilchards collected as dead, as well as moribund specimens.

In addition, recent results from virology (CPE in cell culture inoculated with imported pilchard tissue) indicate that there may be a virus or other agent in the imported pilchards from California.</PARA>

<PARA>Madam Deputy President, you may recall that I asked the minister to indicate what the government's response was to a particularly inopportune comment made by His Excellency during the Arthur Mills oration on 21 June this year. The comment that I referred to, which appears on page 8 of his speech, is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . having had a full and satisfying lifetime there is a point when the succeeding generations deserve to be disencumbered&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>to coin a clumsy word&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of some unproductive burdens.</PARA>
<PARA>They were the words of His Excellency and, with due respect, I find those words at least insensitive if not offensive to those within the community who are getting towards the end of their natural life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I asked of the minister was not about the Northern Territory legislation, it was not about the debate on euthanasia or anything about that in general, but whether or not the government embraced the views enunciated by His Excellency. Of course, the minister's first line of defence was that the Governor-General was expressing a personal point of view and, as a result, the government did not have to comment on it and would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arthur Tunstall, when he made certain comments, was expressing, undoubtedly, a personal point of view, yet the government saw fit to dissociate itself from his comments as not being in line with what one might describe as mainstream thinking within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to read today's front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian </EMPHASIS>which indicates that the Governor in that state made certain comments on certain issues. Guess who got stuck into the Governor in Western Australia? None other, Mr Deputy President, than the Labor opposition in your home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is okay for the Australian Labor Party to get stuck into a governor who happens to express views in a social policy debate which might generally be described as conservative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is good enough for the Labor Party to respond to a Governor in Western Australia, why on earth is it not good enough for the Labor Party to respond to His Excellency's comments in relation to this?</PARA>

But, at this stage, the point of the debate is not so much what was actually said, but the fact that the Labor Party does deem it appropriate to respond to what they consider the Queen's representative has said on some occasion. So it is inexcusable and indefensible for the minister to try to hide behind the fact that they were personal comments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I have been told, I also understand that the nurses, through the Australian Nurses Federation on their behalf, obviously, entered an enterprise agreement only this year with the Joint House Department.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that there is talk of them being reclassified, not upwards but downwards, for an alleged saving of about $5,000 out of a budget of about $40 million. I find this whole thing extraordinary. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of visitors does not go down in the building; it goes up. The number of staff moving into this building is consistently going up.

<PARA>It is very rare in this House to focus so much on foreign affairs as we have in the past two weeks. Senator Gareth Evans seemed to dominate question time completely today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians now, more than ever, have become very concerned about and focused on our foreign affairs and how it is operating. They are fast losing confidence in exactly how it is operating. Senator Evans, in the decade or more that he has held this particular portfolio, has run a policy of `good guy' diplomacy, and it is now unravelling before him. It is being seen for what it really is. It is a meek approach and `it really could be worse' diplomacy. Everything in the world, in Australia's context, `could be worse'. Senator Evans's immortal words were flushed out in relation to the resumption of nuclear testing by the French. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a badly judged decision. Even the cabinet has now woken up to that. It badly misjudged the Australian public's outrage about this matter. Every signal that was given to the French prior to their making this decision was that Australia's reaction would really just be regulation and routine. It badly let down the region, which looks to Australia for leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But worse than that is the ongoing approach to the East Timor question. Any position Australia may take on human rights is simply not now taken seriously or respected. The best evidence of that is the evidence of late. I refer to the appointment of Lieutenant-General Herman Bernard Leopold Mantiri, a 55-year-old who has been named the ambassador to Australia from Indonesia. This man's infamous claim to fame was that he was named the commander of the region which included East Timor after the Dili massacre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an interview with the Indonesian magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Editor</EMPHASIS> in 1992, he said, `We don't regret anything. What happened was proper. They were opposing us, demonstrating, even yelling things against the government.' It is true that at that time Senator Evans condemned those words. He relayed, via our embassy, that Australia was deeply distressed and deeply regretted the remarks. He repeated that here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the truth of the matter is that the ambassador's appointment still stands. He will be with us in this country. He has no regrets. There is no retraction. There is not even the most mild apology from the Indonesian government. The future ambassador, by his comments, fully endorses the Dili massacre&mdash;a massacre that was soundly condemned not only by Australia and by this parliament but also by the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the government accept this appointment? It really has to push harder as part of the major initiative that Senator Evans has been expecting of late. For starters, we must relay to the Indonesians our grave disappointment with this appointment and have the appointment, if not turned around, then short-lived. If we do not do that, then we will be in a fashion allowing someone who supports a massacre&mdash;the comparisons abound&mdash;to represent the Indonesians in this country.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two bills we hope to be dealing with are the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, including amendments to be moved on behalf of the government to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the bulk of the amendments are of a technical nature there is one of major significance, which the Commission believes warrants granting of category T status for the current sittings. This amendment relates to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Computerisation of the Senate scrutiny</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment will allow the AEC to conduct the Senate scrutiny by computer means, which will enable the Senate results to be announced much earlier, and with considerable savings, than with the current tedious and time consuming manual process;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment would be a considerable advantage to Senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry, Research and Development Amendment Bill 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill retrospectively validates Guidelines made under sections 39E, 39EA, 39F and 39HB of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 (`the Act'). It will also provide for the making of new guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that this Bill is introduced and passed in the current sittings (Winter 1995) so as to ensure the validity of the Guidelines which are used in the decision-making process of the Industry Research and Development Board ("the Board"). The invalidity of those guidelines renders all subsequent decisions of the Board invalid. Passage of validating legislation this sittings is required to not only validate relevant decisions of the Board but also to allow the Board to resume its statutory functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the amendments has arisen as a result of a Departmental administrative oversight in failing to table these Guidelines in accordance with the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. The significance of this oversight became apparent following a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's 13th report for 1995 relates to the construction of a new building complex for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, which is the Australian government's principal geoscientific agency. At present, the majority of its staff are accommodated in the Anzac Park East offices on Constitution Avenue, Parkes, ACT. In this building, occupational health and safety authorities have identified serious deficiencies which expose staff to unacceptable risks. There is also danger to AGSO's valuable geoscientific data bank and associated scientific equipment, which could be irreparably damaged or destroyed. A need therefore exists to provide a safe working environment for staff as well as appropriate accommodation for AGSO's data bank and scientific equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report which I have tabled recommends the construction of a new building complex on the corner of Jerrabomberra Avenue and Hindmarsh Drive at Symonston, ACT. The project will comprise laboratories and related areas, offices and administrative support areas, storage areas, staff amenities, engineering workshops, roads, car parking, civil works and landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original reference to the committee was to construct the building in Narrabundah Lane, Symonston. However, due to the presence of the earless dragon lizard on the site, it has been necessary to move to a nearby site located 300 metres away on the corner of Jerrabomberra Avenue and Hindmarsh Drive. This little lizard, which could fit in the palm of one's hand, must be the strongest thing known to man. It lifted a building complex and moved it 300 metres because it was on site. The move has cost taxpayers an extra $700,000. It is not even an endangered species. The earless dragon lizard is a species not currently listed as endangered, but it is certainly considered vulnerable by reptile experts. It is expected to be listed under the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 later this year. Quite frankly, I think it should be listed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guinness book of records</EMPHASIS>. I cannot recall something that size being responsible for such activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there is a possibility of the presence of the earless dragon and the legless lizard on this site, the committee has been assured that any found on the site will be removed for scientific study by the ACT Parks and Conservation Service. I said the other day that that will be rather expensive. It will cost something like $54,000 to remove any found on site. Their accommodation expenses for the year run into something like $20,000-odd. Senator Harradine or I could stay quite well at the Hyatt in Canberra for that sort of money. But if the legless lizard and the earless dragon are found on the new site, they will be afforded new taxpayers' funds to accommodate them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the need to change sites, the committee recommends that projects should not be referred to it until all issues relating to site selection, including environmental clearances, have been obtained. Had this occurred prior to referral of the project to the committee, it would not have been necessary to change the location of the site, conduct two public hearings as well as pay for the removal of the lizards from the site and their board with the ACT Parks and Conservation Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated cost of the proposal when referred to the committee was $114 million.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Laboratory Complex for CSIRO Division of Minerals Clayton, Victoria</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled recommends the proposal for the construction of a laboratory complex at the CSIRO site at Clayton for the Division of Minerals which was formed on 1 January 1995 by the amalgamation of the Division of Mineral and Process Engineering and the Division of Mineral Products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed works will relocate staff of the former Division of Mineral Products from substandard and inadequate accommodation at Port Melbourne into a new complex on the CSIRO site at Clayton.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complex will be designed to accommodate 130 staff including a number of visitors and students. The staff will include 92 research and research support personnel and 32 in management, administration and technical support plus 6 visiting scientists and students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complex will incorporate research laboratories, analytical laboratories, process bays, offices and meeting rooms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the proposal is $16.2m at February 1995 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed relocation of the Division of Minerals from Port Melbourne to the principal Victorian CSIRO site at Clayton, is consistent with the long term CSIRO strategy to integrate and consolidate compatible research resources and facilities on a small number of major regional sites. In effect, this particular proposal is the culmination of a 35 year program to transfer a group of compatible research divisions in Melbourne&mdash;the majority from one consolidated site at Fishermens Bend&mdash;to Clayton.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Port Melbourne site is a converted paint factory on a State Government lease which expires in 2005. It has been the subject of numerous studies regarding occupational health and safety deficiencies. The site is inadequate due to the age of the buildings, lack of space and high infrastructure costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some 70 per cent of the existing accommodation has already reached the end of its useful life and should be replaced. Termite infestation is also a significant problem. By the end of the current site lease, only the instrument laboratory, the administration wing, the analytical laboratory and the hazardous materials store, will have any residual economic life. These represent only some 27 per cent of the research useable floor area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The site for the proposed laboratory complex for the CSIRO Division of Minerals on the CSIRO campus at Clayton is suitable and allows for future expansion should this be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO has initiated a survey to determine the existence of any site contamination at Port Melbourne from its activities. Prior to occupation by CSIRO the site was occupied by a paint manufacturer. Following completion of this survey measures will be implemented to remove any form of contamination caused by CSIRO occupancy of the site. At the public hearing CSIRO advised the Committee that contamination by CSIRO activities has been assessed by its consultants as minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Committee recognises that CSIRO is confident that its contamination of the site is minimal it is possible that decontamination of the site could be a much more costly exercise than provided for by CSIRO. The Committee believes that the issue of responsibility for decontamination of the site should be clarified by CSIRO as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Maintenance Dredging of Kedron Brook Floodway Brisbane, Queensland</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third report which I have tabled today relates to the proposed maintenance dredging of the Kedron Brook floodway to restore its original design capacity and the disposal of approximately 600 000 cubic metres of dredged spoil on part of the nearby old Brisbane Airport site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kedron Brook floodway consists of an 8.5 kilometre long, deep water channel passing through approximately 500 hectares of flood plain linking the Kedron Brook with Moreton Bay. The floodway was designed to convey flood flows around the new Brisbane Airport site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the proposal is $9.1m at March 1995 prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kedron Brook floodway was constructed by the Commonwealth in 1980 as part of the new Brisbane Airport development to replace existing flood plain drainage systems which were filled during airport works. In designing the capacity of the floodway, the criterion adopted was that flood water levels outside Commonwealth land upstream of the floodway should not be increased as a result of airport construction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since completion of construction, the deep channel of the floodway has been subject to gradual deposition of sediments over most of its length. The channel's flood carrying capacity is now reduced below its design capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As owner of the land, the Commonwealth is responsible for maintenance of the floodway's performance and now needs to restore the channel to its original design capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement for this dredging maintenance to be carried out at about this time was foreshadowed by the then Department of Housing and Construction in its evidence to the Committee during the inquiry into the Proposed Redevelopment of the Brisbane Airport in 1979. (Tenth Report of 1979).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the nature of the sediment material in the floodway channel, the dimensions of the channel and the location of the spoil disposal area, AEM believes it is not economically viable to remove the material by means other than dredging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Spoil dredged from the floodway will be pumped on to the old Brisbane Airport site. The site consists of low lying grassland and former runway and taxiway pavement areas with broken-up asphalt surfacing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AEM is currently negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding with the Brisbane City Council for ownership of the floodway and surrounding land to be transferred to the Brisbane City Council following completion of the dredging proposal. AEM advised the Committee that the Commonwealth will have no further responsibility for maintenance of the floodway following the transfer. The transfer will be at no cost to the Brisbane City Council which will then be responsible for future dredging of the floodway. The land will be held in perpetuity as open space. The Committee understands that the floodway and adjacent land will be incorporated into an expanded Boondall Wetlands Reserve.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains a number of technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 of a minor or administrative nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the proposed amendments were recommended for legislative amendment by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 federal election tabled on 16 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are directed mainly at improving operational procedures in the conduct of elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will enable the Australian Electoral Commission to delegate to staff its powers to supply and charge for goods and services and provide that such goods and services may be supplementary or an alternative to those already supplied under joint rolls arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow the Australian Electoral Commission to delegate its powers under any law, such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act, under which the commission conducts periodic ATSIC elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes two provisions to protect the peace of mind and health of the elderly and infirm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, it will improve the enrolment objection process by allowing relatives and friends who do not live in the same subdivision as electors of unsound mind to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the bill will prohibit canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places on polling day and in special hospitals during the five days before and including polling day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow for electors whose enrolment has been objected to, to be removed from the roll in the period between the issue of the writ for an election and the close of rolls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will help to ensure that only entitled electors vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that the personal details of silent electors will not be disclosed to persons inspecting applications for postal votes enhancing the secrecy of the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow the Australian Electoral Commission to use state of the art methods of security printing of ballot papers instead of using outdated watermarked ballot papers. This will result in considerable savings in ballot paper storage and production costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will extend the right to vote to all divisional returning officers and Australian electoral officers and standardise the method for resolving ties during the counting of votes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also extend the two-candidate preferred count, as conducted in polling places on polling night, to the fresh scrutiny and declaration votes scrutinies, as conducted later by the divisional returning officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will greatly assist the Australian Electoral Commission's efficiency in conducting the next election by allowing it to conduct Senate scrutinies by a computer. The computer program will follow the principles of the manual process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also allow far better access by scrutineers to information such as preferences on ballot papers whose details will be stored within the computer system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This includes information on informal ballot papers and `wildcard' papers that are formal but not in accordance with party tickets. A record of ballot papers notionally transferred at each count, and the progress of the count of votes will also be available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission has conducted demonstrations of the proposed system for political party representatives in each state and territory and for the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The commission estimates that it will save approximately $370,000 at each Senate election by using this system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the greater advantage of the proposed system is that it will reduce the time taken to distribute preferences from weeks to hours and should allow the Senate count to be finalised about the same time as the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also allow for the provision of gender data on electors for the purpose of medical research and health screening programs. This was included at the request of the Minister for Health and with the blessing of the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, those conducting approved medical research and health screening programs may be provided with names and addresses of electors from the Commonwealth electoral roll. However, some of those programs, notably breast screening programs, require the names and addresses of female electors only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally the bill makes a number of minor amendments to correct spelling and syntax errors in the bill and to remove gender-specific language where it still occurs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us today with the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 a piece of legislation which the Greens (WA) take very seriously indeed. It is a bill with huge implications. The National Farmers Federation, in its submission about this bill, wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is a starting line from which we should expect the pressure of competitive forces to bend, reshape, or shatter many other policy areas as the economy adjusts.</PARA>
<PARA>During the hearing, the National Farmers Federation indicated that it was not concerned if local government was badly affected or even went under as a result of part of these implications, because it thought local government was a problem for farmers anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to deal with some of the broader issues in this second reading debate and talk about details in the committee stage. This is a major bill. The issue of competition policy is both technically complex and engages debates on the function of government, the relation of government to commerce, human society and the natural world, competition between social good and unregulated capital accumulation or private investment and the relationship of various tiers of government. What we do here will affect all these things into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed unfortunate that debate has been so limited on this issue. It seems another of the areas where, philosophically, there is little difference between the major parties. As a consequence, many issues have not been brought out. Competition policy is primarily about extending the power of the private sector. You can talk about safeguards, but these are proposed to calm concerns about this extension of the private sector into what has been considered the public domain. Competition policy is about eliminating the public domain, maybe not entirely but at least as far as possible. Why would anyone want to do that? A few people&mdash;generally people with economic power&mdash;might make a good profit out of it. But this is not the reason we are told we should want this. The reason we are given is that the private sector will somehow be more efficient and cheaper and that we will all somehow pay lower bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission says that there will be an increase in gross domestic product which, on average, is equivalent to a gain of $1,500 per household. It does not exactly say that you or I will get that gain or that ordinary people will get it. It does not say who will get it. Some will get the gain and, if it is only a few people and companies, it might be only $1,500 on average but it will be a lot more for the few who benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship between profits and jobs is not direct. This is the same argument we hear about wage restraint, allowing companies to sack large numbers of workers, et cetera. If companies are profitable we will get jobs, so our interests are served by making sure that the wealthy and powerful get as much money as possible. As an argument, this has never really convinced me. The Industry Commission predicated the benefit of competition policy on an increase to GDP of 5.5 per cent, a much larger increase than that predicted by any but the most optimistic as a result of a successful Uruguay Round of GATT. This Industry Commission prediction is based on a number of more specific predictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor John Quiggin, who has been mentioned by several speakers in this debate, makes a number of specific critiques of the Industry Commission report. He notes that the commission claims in its study that all productivity and economic improvements are results of competition policy but not of the Hilmer competition policy. Many gains are results of general macro-economic reform and many have already happened. The commission also goes much further than Professor Hilmer in its agenda upon which the commission claims are based. The commission bases its figures, in part, on its own agenda for extreme privatisation and deregulation beyond that which Hilmer or government are proposing or accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Quiggin notes that many improvements in total factor productivity happened at the same rate or at a greater rate before `competition policy' or `macro-economic reform' became buzz words. Improvements in productivity in this case cannot be attributed to such reform. They are the result of general, technical and management practice improvement that happens anyway. Many of the suggestions that the Industry Commission put forward are simply nonsense. They suggest that competition will automatically result in world's best practice. How? Why? When you say the world's best practice in telecommunications is the operation of a Swiss phone company, competition cannot duplicate this in Australia. There is no way that our telecommunications system will ever be physically equivalent to that of Switzerland. Without being physically equivalent, we simply have a very different situation where we need to establish telecommunications over a continent and between this continent and others often in another hemisphere. This is not to say that something is wrong with Australian telecommunications; it is regarded highly. We export telecommunications service, but we will always have longer transmission paths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not meet the world's best practice in water provision. Technically, we might be excellent in what we do, but we live on a dry continent and it will always be more expensive to provide water than those countries that have a lot of water readily available. The argument for this policy is basically flawed. There is no evidence from other countries that privatisation of essential infrastructure&mdash;power, water and so on&mdash;has resulted in lower costs for consumers. There is a lot of evidence from nations like the United Kingdom that privatisation has resulted in higher costs and that poor management has degraded infrastructure provided by public utilities. This is because such infrastructure constitutes natural monopolies. Where the private sector operates for profit, the temptation is always to use monopoly power to increase profits by raising prices or by decreasing quality or sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where infrastructure has been in private hands for a long time, as with the power industry in the United States, it is generally highly regulated. There are costs to government of overseeing that regulations are met and court actions where they are not. There is also endless argument about whether price rises are justified. There is not a lot of evidence that having a highly regulated private monopoly industry has made these private utilities more efficient or responsive to public values. In fact, it is pretty clear at this point that any benefit to ordinary people will have to come through an improvement in GDP, because it will certainly not come from reduced costs. This is essentially true for rural communities, which will be hit again and again as efforts are made to destroy the principle that all Australians should have access to basic services at the same cost or as near to that as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basic services include power, water, phone services, postal services, banking services and so on. It is pretty clear that government plans to eliminate cross-subsidies and move to a user pays or, more properly, a cost recovery system. This means that the current system, where everyone pays but pays the same, will be abandoned in favour of a system where the rural user&mdash;mainly rural users&mdash;will pay more for power, more for water, more for transport, more for everything. The privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank will probably mean that branches in small towns will be closed down, since it appears that other banks find the cost of maintaining branches too expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other instances of questionable gains. There are real benefits where, for example, small town post offices can act as an agent for the Commonwealth Bank or other bodies. There are real efficiencies here&mdash;what are called economies of scope&mdash;which are likely to be lost as soon as all these agencies become fully corporatised or privatised. A huge load will be placed on them for allocating costs, billing one another, keeping track of it all and for examining claims to ensure there are no rorts. These problems are all avoided when it is simply a government agency helping out efficiently. The book cost to the post office may be reduced, but it is likely to mean higher costs to the community. I do not believe it would ever mean a reduction in the cost of postal services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already started to see the effects of competition policy in Victoria. We have the farcical situation where Australian public infrastructure is considered so inefficient that it must be broken up and privatised. To whom will it be sold? The short list is for foreign firms, none with Australian equity. Among those shortlisted is Electricite de France. Wonderful! Australian public infrastructure is so inefficient that we will sell it off to French public infrastructure. If all public infrastructure needs to become a paragon of efficiency is overseas bids, why do we not have SECV bid to run a power grid of some other country? What are the qualifications of Electricite de France for running a grid based on coal fired power plants? Its experience of several decades is running a grid based on nuclear power. What a wonderful candidate, especially considering what is currently happening at Mururoa!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we worry? There are all sorts of safeguards. We are told that there should be community service obligations or CSOs. We are told that we will have competition to hold  down prices and that we will get this by breaking up utilities. We are told that there will be a new commission which will have the ability to fix prices. We are told that this commission will also have the power of the Trade Practices Commission to eliminate monopoly practices. It will even have more power. It will be able to override the states, ensure consistency and eliminate the petty differences that interfere with business. It will fix everything. Unfortunately, when you ask for particulars, there are none. I note that this bill is being put through prior to the release of the final report of the EPAC private infrastructure task force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in a press release two weeks ago that all governments&mdash;presumably state and federal&mdash;will publish by June 1996 their agenda on implementing the competition principles agreement. A vital part, according to the press release, `will be the way each government intends to protect the public interest, and to deliver community service obligations. Equally important is the role each state sees for local government in the reform process.' In other words, there are currently no guidelines, statements or strategies about how the public interest will be protected. This information will not be available until next year, but we are being asked to pass the bill now. It has also come to my attention that during estimates hearings Senator Harradine asked a number of questions on the impact of cost recovery, especially on rural communities. The answers were simple: the Treasurer's department had no idea of the impact and had no data but would start to look at the issue some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is pushing this through without any real idea of what its effect will be, but, if you ask the government&mdash;as I asked recently&mdash;it will blithely cite the wonderful benefits according to the Industry Commission. This is a total assurance of the ideologue that if we do the right thing, somehow everything will be better. There is no analysis of that `somehow' and no `how'. The simple assertion is that, by selling everything off, by eliminating every regulation parliaments of the past have brought in for some reason and by preventing parliaments of the future from making many sorts of regulations, this will automatically bring huge benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence has not been presented. The studies have been started but have certainly not been completed. Here we are about to pass this bill. Why? Is this responsible? Is this sensible? The evidence from the UK is not good; we have been told, `We will do better.' Where is the plan? Where are the resources? Apparently, those will be developed later and we should pass this bill entirely on trust&mdash;and put our stocking out for Santa while we are at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disturbing aspects is the nature of the bill that we are being asked to support. The parliament will not be having an input or be reviewing competition policy. It is being asked to set up a new commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, under a minister. This new commission will have the amalgamated power of the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority, plus the powers to set prices&mdash;plus the power to review virtually all present and future state and local legislation to ensure it is consistent with competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is competition policy? That is one of the details that has not been worked out yet. The parliament is not asked to set the policy, to review it or to pass it. It is asked to set up another body, the National Competition Council, to suggest its policy. It will also set up the Australian Competition Tribunal, to judge and enforce its decisions. So we are being asked to set up an organisation which will have sweeping powers through regulation, will take advice from its sister organisation, which we will also set up, and will be effectively independent of federal parliament except in its responsibility to the minister, who will have the power&mdash;in fact, the duty&mdash;under this legislation to examine recent and new state and territory laws to ensure that it `meets the requirements' of competition policy, although some pre-1994 legislation will be grandfathered and allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have an organisation at federal level, relatively independent of parliament but under the executive power of the minister, which can effectively interfere in state activities at a level far beyond anything the federal government has been able to do in the past. It can dictate to the states on anything it feels has anti-competitive implications. Since it brings much of the arena of public service into the potentially competitive area, it will look at all regulation affecting any commercial activities for interference with competition. It means that it can interfere in almost anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the National Party to remember the promises relating to the World Trade Organisation and GATT and the degree to which we gave up effective power to assist and regulate activities connected with agriculture. This bill will give far greater powers to a non-parliamentary federal body to make sweeping changes to all sorts of things&mdash;from markets to electricity and water prices, to availability of services to rural communities. Don't think for a moment that it will guarantee services or reduce costs. If there is one thing there is unanimity on, it is that rural users are likely to face higher costs on a wide range of items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are being asked to give up effective power to legislate on the bulk of these issues and to set up this independent organisation which will be able to pursue its agenda. The particulars of the agenda remain unstated. Safeguards are mentioned but remain undefined. We are asked not only to set up this organisation but to empower it to override the rights of state and local governments and the community without referring to federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the states agreed. When? How? It is an object lesson in how this is likely to work. The premiers&mdash;not the people or the legislatures of the states of Australia&mdash;agreed with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Why did they agree? They agreed because Canberra has the power of the purse and used it ruthlessly. The states were `rewarded' with a promise of compensation payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope people in this place realise how good promises are when made to get a result, how long they last and how easy it is to change the terms of a promise after the thing wanted has been attained. Promises we thought were firm and sound seem to change shape, get smaller and become strangely slippery. The thing we hear over and over again in the debate on this bill is that it is not well defined and not ready for legislation. The thing we hear over and over again when problems are brought up is, `Yes, let's pass the bill; we will look into it.' We hear again and again that we need to pass the bill and it can be fixed later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say no; it should not be passed now. We should at least wait for the answers to Senator Harradine's questions. We should wait for the result of EPAC's inquiry. We should wait for the states to put out their agenda and their public interest provisions and see whether these agenda and provisions are accepted. We should have some idea of what we are getting into before we create an organisation that will have a life of its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will allow the establishment of a `starting line from which we should expect the pressure of competitive forces to bend, reshape, or shatter many other policy areas as the economy adjusts', as I quoted at the beginning. If we have any desire to preserve or protect any existing areas of policy, we should wait until the starting line is drawn and the course laid out before we commit ourselves in this way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill has a history which goes back to the 1992 Council of Australian Governments meeting in Canberra. COAG requested that an independent committee of inquiry conduct extensive research to identify those parts of the economy which needed to compete to get the best results for Australia and Australians. As a result of that, the Hilmer report, as it became known, was handed down in August 1993.

This bill seeks to make major amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Prices Surveillance Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of major elements to this bill. The bill will establish two new bodies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, another NCC. Amendments will be made to the competitive conduct rules and their application, and these provide for: the authorisation, on public benefit grounds, of price fixing for goods of resale price maintenance; the repeal of the specific provisions relating to price discrimination; the extension of the competitive conduct rules to the resupply of things in the nature of services; and the removal of the shield of the crown immunity for the states and territories in so far as the crown in these capacities carries on a business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of the competitive conduct rules will be extended to cover areas within state and territory jurisdictions. It will also mean that ACCC and the federal court can exercise administrative and judicial powers respectively. On the whole, the bill is seen by most Australians as a way forward for making the most of competition and business. As an aside, the coalition competition policy, foreshadowed in 1993&mdash;foreshadowed before the Hilmer report of recommendations came down&mdash;covered most of these aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all this publicity, the government seems to have missed the point about total reform of the market. It has missed the biggest part, the part that makes everything else work&mdash;which, as you and I both know, Mr Acting Deputy President, is labour market reform. This shows the government's lack of commitment to true reform and to the pursuit of a truly national competition policy, because you cannot have a truly national competition policy unless you have true competition within the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, this slack government has watered down recommendations to increase competition&mdash;for example, in postal services. It removed the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act and put them in the domain of the Industrial Relations Commission. By doing that, employers were put under increased pressure from secondary boycotts. It has failed to do anything in regard to the trans-Tasman accord. We have heard a lot over the past few days about the Accord Mark VIII but we have not heard a lot about the trans-Tasman accord in recent times. This is an area of labour market policy where lack of action means more delays and more disputes on our waterfront. It is an illegal shipping accord between maritime unions in Australia and New Zealand whereby industrial bans are imposed on shipping between Australia and New Zealand in support of Australian and New Zealand flagships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the government has refused to open up coastal shipping to competition. Competition would mean better ship movements around our country and would establish easier links between the states and other countries. As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, being a fellow Tasmanian, our state would be a major beneficiary of any type of competitive feeling within the shipping industry. We know for a fact that the average wharfie earns around $70,000 a year. That is one of the big imposts on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I was making inquiries about one of our local brick making firms near Launceston at Perth. The manufacturer was very interested in exporting concrete blocks to Israel. I am sad to say that the cost of shipping a container of bricks between Launceston and Melbourne was $1,500 per container. To ship that same container load of bricks from Melbourne to Israel was only $1,300. Unfortunately, while there is a fair amount of competition on the overseas market, there does not seem to be any on the local market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, in the debate on the Qantas sale bill, I mentioned that the government refused to allow the single trans-Tasman aviation market. As Senator Vanstone would know, it has even rejected suggestions that restrictions on compact discs be lifted to increase competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where this legislation is less than perfect is that of local government, an area which is close to my heart. Local governments are very concerned, fearing that some states may introduce these measures to the detriment of the local government authorities. Some questions raised by local government have not yet been answered by the government. For example, local councils could find themselves competing with private garbage disposal sites. In itself, that is not a bad thing but it is an area in which they are looking for answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also likely that some local government services&mdash;such as car park administration and garbage collection&mdash;could be tendered out, and some of the more progressive councils around Australia have done that. There are a number of opportunities for this third tier of government to streamline operations and increase returns to ratepayers. In some states that is already happening. Obviously, a number of benefits will eventuate from this legislation in other areas. It is hoped that this will increase real disposable income for all Australians. I am led to believe that it could amount to something like $1,500 per household. It should also make goods manufactured in Australia more competitive and available, thereby increasing the market share for those goods and creating jobs&mdash;jobs that are desperately needed, even now. These reforms will also reduce pressure on inflation and prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in closing that we must remember that the prime objective of this act is to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and provision for consumer protection. While all legislation passing through our hands should be good for Australians, this bill is seen to be more than usually beneficial, placing as it does change and progress before us and making organisations work for the betterment of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we welcome some of the initiatives in the bill, it is necessary in this house of review to acknowledge more fully the failure of this government to tackle true competition. As I mentioned before, we find examples of that in the labour market, in postal services, in removing the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act, in the trans-Tasman accord&mdash;an illegal document that isolates so many Australians&mdash;in coastal shipping, leading to more isolation, in refusal of a single trans-Tasman aviation market, and in the restrictions on compact discs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the Senate is debating the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. This bill will radically change the way public services are delivered to the public. It also involves major institutional changes to the enforcement of the Trade Practices Act and the Prices Surveillance Authority with the establishment of a merged Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the National Competition Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Victoria, we are already well aware of what happens to service delivery under reforms driven by very narrow reactionary economics. It is actually a misnomer to call these changes `reforms'. An example is the way the Kennett government has treated local government and has treated the services supplied to country Victoria. Under competition policy, the Victorian experiment could rapidly become the national benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up to six million Australians&mdash;pensioners and those in rural communities in particular&mdash;could be direct losers as a result of this bill. When government agencies start behaving like private businesses, can we expect them to keep offering concessions to the 2.7 million Australians who hold a pensioner card, not to mention their 700,000 dependants? Many of these people will rely on the special concessions they get on phone bills, electricity tariffs and public transport in order to maintain a decent standard of living. Where are the safeguards in this bill to ensure that profit-driven government enterprises continue to meet these community service obligations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all seen what banking deregulation has done to low income earners. The banks have simply whacked on huge account fees because they do not want to do business with pensioners and social security recipients. There just is not enough money in it for them. The fees imposed by the government's part-privatised Commonwealth Bank are amongst the highest and meanest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other big group that stands to lose is the nearly three million Australians who live outside the big cities. Cross-subsidisation is likely to be an early victim of competition policy. Cross-subsidisation within public services&mdash;where the profitable parts of a service subsidise the unprofitable parts&mdash;has been a fundamental part of the economic pact between metropolitan and regional Australia. The most obvious example of cross-subsidisation is the standard postage rate across the country for letters. Such standard rates will increasingly be a thing of the past as agencies are forced to pay their way and compete in their profitable activities. Current cross-subsidies are likely to disappear in a competitive environment, so country people could lose out not only in postal services but also in air services, electricity, gas and water prices, public transport, with the closure of railway lines&mdash;as we have already seen in Victoria&mdash;and in access to telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about accelerating the corporatisation of public enterprise. Corporatised state public transport has seen rail services to country areas cut, stations closed down, staff put off and sometimes even track pulled up. The Hilmer reforms are about more of the same. They are about taking the same principles and applying them across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deregulated competitive market forces favour big players over small players, and that means the city over the bush. When banks are deregulated, lots of country towns see their branches close down or turned into `service centres'. Instead of having a local bank manager who knew their business, farmers and rural businesses have their loan applications sent off for `processing' by head office bean counters. The 15 to 20 cents petrol price difference between city and country is another scary example of what people in the bush can expect from competitive outcomes. Profit-making oil companies are not concerned about fairness; just about the profits they make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the service areas provided by public enterprise&mdash;Australia Post, Telecom, the utilities, airports, intrastate bus services and so on&mdash;the long-run impact will be either higher charges for rural users or serious cutbacks. The Hilmer policy calls for the replacement of these cross-subsidies with direct budget funding to continue support to the subsidised groups. We all know that these so-called `community service obligations' will be underfunded to begin with and eroded over time as governments sacrifice fairness in order to appease financial markets with shonky budget surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competition package will require government businesses to operate on a competitively neutral basis: that is, any advantage that they may have as a government entity will have to be destroyed to allow the private sector to adequately compete. But the burdens that a government business has which a private sector business does not have&mdash;notably public accountability requirements and transparency&mdash;will remain. So really, competitive neutrality means a playing field tilted inadvertently to the private sector. Worse still, it could mean that the accountability measures of a public service delivery start to be fritted down. We have already seen that happen in the Commonwealth sector with the Commonwealth ombudsman complaining that she is unable to deal with complaints on services which have been contracted out, and with the government's continuing refusal to agree to allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that competition policy reform is completely negative. Opening up some elements of government activity to competition would improve efficiency and may improve service delivery. But let us debate both sides: the upside and the downside. So far the government has failed to acknowledge that these changes have a downside, and this is to be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to speak briefly about the proposed composition of the commission and the National Competition Council. As part of the deal at COAG the federal government has agreed to give the states an effective veto over appointments to the commission and to the council. The majority of states and the Commonwealth have to agree to an appointment before it can be made. This has been criticised by most major public interest groups, including the ACTU, ACOSS, the consumer lobby and the ACF. In brief, there is little faith in the ability of the states to agree to the broad, community based, public interest oriented representation that is needed at the commission and council level to ensure that the upside and the downside of any change is considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that local government, which is a party to COAG and which is expected to implement competition policy, will not be consulted or even considered in the appointments to these bodies. It is also significant that the government has refused to agree to a dedicated consumer representative on the council, although there will be one on the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will be watching the appointments process with great interest. We are aware that many big business representatives are not at all happy with the current activist membership of the Trade Practices Commission and are lobbying the states to ensure that more compliant appointments are made to the commission and to the council. These appointments will be a key test of the commitment of this government to ensuring that the interests of consumers, local government, the regions, and the environment are relevant and vital in the implementation of competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would have preferred to see the states consulted, but for them not to hold a veto over appointments. This would ensure that the membership could be balanced and could represent the national interest rather than sectional interests. We will be moving an amendment to that effect at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be moving a number of other amendments and I wish to foreshadow some of those to the Senate today. They refer to the provisions of unconscionable conduct in the Trade Practices Act. I welcome the minister's answer today during question time when he said that the government is positively disposed towards reforms in this area. But he also stated that there are some big business sectors who are not quite as ready to accept the need for changes in this particular area. I have circulated a set of proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act which I will be moving during the committee stage of the bill and I would suggest that, in view of his agreement in principle, the minister gives favourable consideration to these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of these amendments provides that a corporation must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that amounts to economic duress, within the meaning of the unwritten law of the states and territories. Presently, the common law remedy for unconscionable conduct is too limited to enable its application to all but a minuscule number of business transactions. In the Democrats' view the remedy should be extended to include the equitable remedy of economic duress. While this would not be a huge change, it would open the remedy just enough to make it effective in those cases where large businesses use their economic power to take away the bargaining capacity of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment seeks to introduce the possibility for recovery of damages under section 51AA. The amendment simply amends section 82 so that a person who suffers loss or damage by virtue of the unconscionable conduct provision may also take action to recover the amount of loss or damage caused by the contravention of the act. Presently section 82 of the Trade Practices Act provides that if conduct contravening part IV, restrictive trade practices, or part V, consumer protection, causes loss or damage, those persons affected may recover the amount of that loss or damage by taking action against the person or persons involved in the contravention. This amendment rectifies what appears to have been a legislative oversight by adding damage suffered as a result of unconscionable conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment seeks to adds part IV, restrictive trade practices, into section 87(1B), a provision that allows representative actions to be taken on the basis that contraventions of part IVA, unconscionable conduct, or part V, consumer protection, have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years the Trade Practices Act has had the power to take representative action on  behalf of consumers but, through what appears to be another legislative oversight, representative action to recover loss or damage from price fixing or monopoly practices has not been available. Typically, only big business has the resources to take private action. There is a strong case for the Trade Practices Commission also to have the ability to take representative action for conduct in breach of the rules regulating restrictive trade practices in part IV of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Law Reform Commission has already recognised this need in its report on remedies under the TPC Act. The government has more recently accepted it when it promised in the Justice Statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will remove current restrictions on the Trade Practices Commission's ability to take representative actions under the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have outlined, most of these amendments simply correct legislative oversights and have been accepted by the government in principle. There is absolutely no reason why these amendments cannot now be supported by the government and passed by the Senate, pending some further, more detailed reforms by the government in future. </PARA>

Among them are an estimated 5.5 per cent annual increase in GDP, representing a $23 billion annual increase in 1993-94 dollars, resulting in a benefit to households of an estimated $1,500 per year. After tax, wages are estimated to rise by 3 per cent, while employment and government revenues will also increase. The Industry Commission also found that small impacts of individual reforms add up to widespread and substantial gains.

He described competition policy reform in the 1990s as `a new era with the endorsement by the state and federal governments of the principles of the national competition policy'. The merger of the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority, giving overall responsibility for the administration of the new policy to a single new commission, is described as building on `a strong foundation of experience in competition policy'. He expressed confidence that the new commission `will be as strong a pro-competitive force in the future as the current commission has been for the past 20 years'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this legislation and the micro-economic reform that it proposes to deliver are significant is apparent to all. It is worth noting the comment of Mr Paul Barrett, of the Business Council of Australia, when quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 28 February this year. When discussing the Labor government's lack of commitment to tie this micro-economic reform process to a commitment to industrial relations reform, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister certainly procured the big decision but he has yet again deferred the hard one.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Don McGauchie, the President of the NFF, echoed those sentiments in his address to the Making Hilmer Happen conference held in Canberra in March this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NFF considers that the Hilmer blueprint is a less-than-complete package. The exclusion of the labour market is unforgivable . . . it is illogical and unacceptable to have rigorous competition rules applied to product and services markets, to Governments, to finance and equity markets and then to leave out the one other major factor in all economic activity&mdash;the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>Those sentiments strongly reflect my own view and, I am sure, the views of my Liberal and National Party colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major shortcoming of the Hilmer report is its failure to examine the labour market. There was nothing in the brief which prevented an examination of this key factor in productivity improvement. I understand that the Hilmer committee thought hard about it and realised that labour market deregulation is fundamental but thought that if it were tackled in the same brief it would ensure that everything else would be pigeon-holed by this government. In other words, the Hilmer committee recognised the complete lack of political will on the part of this federal Labor government to tackle the hard decisions. Let us face it, reform decisions which do not affect your mates are not hard decisions at all. It is stepping on your mates' toes which is hard. That is something this government persistently refuses to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best the Hilmer committee could hope for was that if competition was extended to the whole of the national economy then pressure would be put on the labour market anyway to accelerate reform. Therefore, the Hilmer committee decided that, rather than throw the baby out with the bath water, it would acknowledge the need for labour market reform but leave it alone. It has been criticised for this ever since. The best that can be said for its strategy is that there is substantial implication of the committee's other recommendations occurring. The federal government stands condemned for requiring this strategy of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the states have agreed to the implementation of the Hilmer committee's reforms for competition. This is just as well, as the burden of implementation will rest with them. We should note, however, that there are some reservations by the smaller states that they may suffer discrimination and that the negotiation processes which resulted in the COAG agreement earlier this year involved an element of railroading by the larger states. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that this inevitable process of competition reform has benefits for all Australians, and the concept should be embraced to take advantage of those benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the detail, particularly the practical effects on small business, as highlighted in the hearings of the Economics Legislation Committee on this bill, may not be apparent until much further down the track. The significance of the burden placed on small business is obviously an issue. My colleagues Senators Abetz and Gibson and I made reference to the need to tackle business concerns with sensitivity in our minority report to the Senate following our participation in the legislation committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The touted benefits&mdash;lower prices for the consumer and a wider range of choice, benefits from efficiencies created, including removal of some of the deficits which are funded by the taxpayer&mdash;have been met with mixed reaction in the community. For example, the re-examination of contracts which are currently exempted by the Trade Practices Act and the extension to include the professions have been well received by the legal profession, which has been openly competitive for some time. However, the medical profession&mdash;and doctors, in particular&mdash;see this competition as potentially jeopardising quality of service and as impacting on the fiduciary relationship inherent in their professions. None of the professions should be exempt from competition. The claim that they are setting industry standards is nothing more than an excuse for price setting. Standards of practice should certainly be maintained but limits to entrance to the professions and price setting are unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The president of the NFF, Mr McGauchie, commented that agriculture would support its statutory marketing authorities to a public benefit test of the extent of anti-competitive nature of centralised marketing but would not bear the cost alone if other politically sensitive sectors were treated softly. He stated that it `is not without some trepidation' that agriculture supports competition policy reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us never forget that it is farmers who, thus far, have borne much of the brunt of deregulation with, for example, the loss of single-desk selling on the domestic wheat market, dairy industry reforms and the collapse of the wool reserve price scheme. But they have received little benefit to the cost input side of their business equation, with protection and regulation remaining untouched in many other sectors of the economy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government's failure to initiate much needed industrial relations reform in conjunction with competition policy reforms essentially means that, despite this legislation and the honest intent by Hilmer and others to provide structure to improve productivity, real competition in Australia is thwarted when union monopoly power is underpinned by the Minister for Industrial Relations and Transport, Laurie Brereton, and his Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be overstated that this federal Labor government simply refuses to introduce workable industrial relations reform because it refuses to tread on the toes of its political mates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government watered down the Industry Commission's recommendations to open up competition within the postal services sector. It weakened protection for employers against secondary boycotts and has shackled small business with ludicrous unfair dismissal laws. The government has failed to allow international competition in coastal shipping, maintains an illegal shipping accord between the maritime unions in Australia and New Zealand, and has imposed industrial bans on shipping. It has also backed down on the trans-Tasman aviation market. These are but a few examples of the failure of this government with regard to introducing greater competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the negotiation of the latest Accord Mark VIII highlights the union monopoly power structure. The measures in this bill simply reinforce the bottom line that the federal government is happy to pass off&mdash;if you will pardon the trade practices pun&mdash;the burden to the states, but will do nothing itself for this country if it is detrimental to the leverage of its political mates. Therefore, some of the resistance on the part of state governments&mdash;if not outright rejection in parts&mdash;to the break up or sale of government monopolies is entirely predictable. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a bold statement which should give Dr Quiggin a warm feeling were it not for the federal Labor government's decision to cut funding to those programs in the 1995-96 budget. Consequently, this statement is extraordinary and quite unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that this bill and the two inter-governmental agreements `represent a complete response to the recommendations of the Hilmer Committee'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Des Moore, former deputy secretary of the Commonwealth Treasury, in an Institute of Public Affairs paper on reforming public trading enterprises under the new competition regime, noted the political sensitivities associated with privatisation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation issue in relation to public utilities was highlighted by British industry minister Heseltine in January 1994 when the UK parliament introduced the Coal Industry Bill to privatise British coal, after nearly 50 years of public sector ownership. In introducing the bill, Heseltine argued that the original nationalisation policy had been `designed to transfer the commanding heights of the economy to state control.' He went on to explain that this `naive political rationalisation' did not come to pass. He said, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reality, power rapidly shifted to monopoly providers and monopoly producer unions.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the years, Telecom has provided a classic example of this in Australia and union power continues to hinder the introduction of full competition to telecommunications in this country. The corporatisation versus privatisation argument is an issue which has already been addressed by the states, with some opting for privatisation of public utilities and some opting for corporatisation or a combination of both, with varying degrees of success. By comparison, despite its rhetoric, the performance of the Federal Government on privatisation has been sadly lacking. Let us not forget the four years it has taken to get to first base with the Qantas float, nor the recent $1 billion extraction from Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has chosen instead to entrench union monopolisation in the corporatisation of government enterprises. These organisations are ultimately subject to ministerial intervention which essentially equates to policy meddling. GBEs only operate in a quasi-commercial sense and although they are at arm's length from government, they are kept on a tight rein and restructuring generally has been kept at the statutory level. The enterprises are heavily politicised, controlled and influenced and their boards frequently stacked with the government's `mates'. They are thus not commercially orientated. Only full privatisation can remove assets from government control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until such time as the Federal Government shows more leadership in introducing genuine competition, it can hardly expect the states to do likewise. In spite of this, some state governments have boldly bitten the bullet.In South Australia, the Brown liberal government has chosen a path of combining corporatisation and privatisation in a laudable attempt to rehabilitate the South Australian economy. Recent examples of privatisation are the sale of the State Bank of South Australia, which the state Labor government left in ruins, and the sale of the pipeline authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to public utilities, the SA government, unlike Victoria and NSW, has chosen the corporatisation route. There have been and will be some stumbling blocks but it should be noted that the recent stumbles have been in negotiations with the unions which have shifted the base-line in negotiations and threatened to cut power supplies to South Australians. This was after the unions had agreed to the terms of the negotiation. Suffice to say that genuine competition is still being hampered by union resistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on the road to true competition corporatisation is often viewed as a stepping stone to privatisation, there are obvious and significant benefits to be gained from corporatisation for the states, particularly in relation to public utilities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, while in Australia state sovereignty remains important, especially for the smaller states and it remains an important role of this Senate to protect that sovereignty, in today's economic circumstances state boundaries are irrelevant.

But we need to fix the national market before we can tackle the international, otherwise the attempt is akin to having one hand tied behind your back.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts has raised some of the fundamental issues relating to this Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. I rise to speak to some of the environmental and social justice aspects, particularly in relation to water and power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues here must recognise and admit that the Greens and the environment movement generally have been pushing for years to take environmental concerns out of the box represented by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and to see their wider integration into the policies of other departments. As long as Primary Industries and Energy, Industry, Housing, and Transport see themselves as concerned with non-environmental issues and environmental measures relating to them as interference, we will continue to have worsening environmental problems. Yet here we see another even more powerful body being set up which not only does not consider environmental implications but will probably view environmental regulation as an interference to competition to be avoided or eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation of water is a good case in point. For years, public sector water authorities operated on a good manager basis, trying both to provide needed water and to manage the water resources. Over the last few decades, the management function has increased because of public pressure focused through environment groups and also because of rising population, increasing pollution and increasing expense and difficulty of developing new water resources. This management function has really blossomed in the last decade, with water authorities actively promoting water conservation and looking into a range of innovative options to reduce water use. There has also been a rising awareness of the inseparability of areas such as farming; forestry; control of industrial and domestic pollution; and the maintenance of clean, high quality water resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that all of these issues were handled to some degree by government meant that round tables and integrated policies were possible, although initially it may have required a lot of pressure to get various departments to a common table. It has paid off, and now land and water care, control of inputs into ground water, control of nutrient levels, making sure there is fringing vegetation to reduce salinity and other problems, reducing land clearing and management of forestry around watersheds have all assured that the degradation of water resources has slowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, degradation is still occurring. Coordination within government and between levels of government has borne fruit and improved the situation, but the state of the rivers and dams; the increase of salinity and eutrophication; the algal blooms, particularly the toxic blooms such as the blue-green bacterial blooms; and the recent massive fish deaths in some rivers are all evidence that congratulations should not go too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that all this coordinated effort, all the years of trying to get some action and recognition and commitment to dealing with the problem, is likely to be lost. When we privatise water, we put in a new manager&mdash;one who is working to increase company profit. We do so because of the argument that it may be more efficient and so decrease cost. But there is no history with a new company. All the past experience is lost. They will come in with a new broom and get rid of senior staff, especially in any area seen as non-essential, such as water conservation. Not only that; it is far more difficult to get them around a negotiating table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental problem is that the purpose and focus of such a private operator must be different. Their business is not to manage or conserve water; it is to sell it. The more they sell, the better. In such a case, spending money to get people to conserve water is a waste of money&mdash;in their terms&mdash;inefficient and commercially counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector knows that in a market if water becomes scarce, that just makes it more expensive. Consumer choice will determine if people want water and how much they want at the new price. That is what efficient allocation of resources means, according to economists. What it does not recognise is that people may need water. Somehow necessity was left out of Adam Smith's model of the market. What else is unrecognised is that human beings are not the centre of the universe or the only users of water. Trees and plants depend on the water table at a certain height. Fish, including oceanic fish stocks, may depend on the quantity and quality of riverine water. They cannot dig wells and they cannot pay and we need them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But private sector water operators do not need to know about this; they only need to know the bottom line economic figures. Are they selling all the water they can? Is there any activity that is non-productive that they can cut? Activities such as water conservation, water quality monitoring, monitoring inputs into streams, dams and ground water are the business of the EPA, landcare groups or DEST and no concern of theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember, these are issues that arise from simple privatisation. What we are actually seeing is that water will not just be privatised; it will be broken up into several companies. This will mean that all the negative consequences of privatisation will be amplified, while no company will have a need or rationale for an overview of what is happening to water in the region. All the environmental issues are exacerbated since water flows and becomes the problem of some other utility downstream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the equity question. In commercial and strict engineering terms, the more water a customer uses, the cheaper it is to provide. Big business should get bulk discount rates&mdash;the bigger the cheaper. Then cheap prices can encourage more water hungry industries and we can substantially draw down the water table and put those unused resources to work. For domestic users, all this base rate excess water stuff should go. It is just cross-subsidy. The business is selling water and those who use more require less maintenance per litre provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On economic grounds, people who do not use much water should pay more&mdash;like small accounts in banks pay more. This is a disastrous equity position. Of course, any rural water provision will cost more to provide, so should cost more for the user. The rich will get cheaper water and be encouraged to use more for their big lawns, nice gardens and fountains. The average householder should pay more. Why should there be a base rate? Should the poor be subsidised? Actually, they should pay penalty rates because of high maintenance costs. If we are going to subsidise people who do not use much water, it should be done through a social security rebate and properly means tested, which will increase the social security outlays and provoke more calls for cuts to that portfolio. Isn't this what competition policy is all about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Water, sadly, is not a unique case. Similar considerations apply to electricity. While electricity is not a natural resource, air, coal and weather are. Currently, efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions and promote energy conservation could and should be handled in an integrated way between departments of housing, local government through building codes and zoning, through urban planning, transport, public transport, departments of industry and development industry and the EPAs. The fact that currently little or nothing is being done does not mean that it is acceptable to make the option of action much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of major difficulties has always been that energy utilities see themselves as sellers of power in the way I decried as attitudes likely for private water utilities. Their agenda has always been to sell as much power as they can and to expand. It is only recently that calls for energy management have seen any response. This incipient response is likely to disappear with privatisation. The result will be increasing greenhouse emissions, acid rain, photochemical smog events and total failure to meet greenhouse targets. The kind of integrated approach between various sectors and departments and the use of economic and tax incentives and disincentives, regulation and other policy mechanisms in a concerted way will become much more difficult even if it is not directly opposed as a barrier to competition. Any cost can no longer easily come from energy revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move to cost recovery, we will see the same discounts for energy intensive industries, some reduction for businesses in central business districts, higher rates for households, penalty rates for low power users who consequently have higher relative servicing costs and super penalties to rural and remote users. There may be some scope, if governments are committed, to providing programs such as Illawarra Power's subsidy for replacing remote grid connection with stand-alone power systems using renewable energy. But since it will cost money, there is not likely to be a lot of motive for a private utility to go to the trouble if they can simply charge a lot more and leave the choice to the consumer. If companies do take this on, they will probably want money from government while public utilities could see it as part of energy management for the public good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privatisation of power will create other problems, especially with the suggestion of an integrated south-eastern grid. Please do not call it a national grid when you talk to someone from Western Australia. If privatised power utilities compete to provide power to the grid and money is distributed accordingly, there will be a big push in Victoria to provide more power at cut rates from brown coal. They will try to make up in volume what they do not have in quality. The state government is liable to aid this rather than see power money flow out of Victoria to other states. The consequences would be environmentally disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On equity grounds, this legislation also creates problems with the push for increasing privatisation of public services opening a very big can of worms. What services are included and how a privatised system can be regulated to ensure the common good is met is a very complex issue. We have not really seen the full agenda of privatisation. We have certainly not seen proposals for any safeguards. Environmental safeguards, standards and performance criteria are particularly lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support Senator Margetts in her claim that this legislation is not at all ready for consideration. We have almost no idea what we are considering, what the implications are or what it will cost. The government owes it to the Senate and to the people of Australia, who in most polls oppose privatisation of public utilities, to go away and come back when it has something more specific to offer and some evidence that it will improve the situation for ordinary people, the poor and the environment. I say `improve' and not `work without imposing hardship'. If we are to make this major change without any real assurance it will work, it is not enough to say that things will not be worse. There must be and should be a promise that they will be positively better. We have seen no evidence of this so far. </PARA>

There has rarely been an occasion when senior business executives such as Don Argus from the National Bank have not taken the opportunity to ram home the need for accelerated micro-economic reform so that business costs and operations will be reduced and business made more competitive in the world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criticism is always levelled at the glacial pace and the fatigue of the government's micro-economic reform agenda, particularly in the areas of industrial relations and waterfront reform. The government should be convinced if, for no other reason, than the benefits that reduced business costs and an efficient national economy will bring to long-term employment, real jobs and a sustained high standard of living. To this end, the Competition Policy Reform Bill is very welcome, be it a cautious step in the micro-economic reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, whatever competition policy might mean to senior executives and the mandarins of Canberra, to most Australians it is a very nebulous term.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge my colleague Senator Boswell's address regarding the need for a very strong hand to protect small business against what can go so very wrong with this competition policy&mdash;for example, the mad ideological push to deregulate taxis when commonsense and good business would dictate otherwise. That is why the Competition and Consumer Commission will be a very vital watchdog against unsubstantiated deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have confidence that this will occur given the strong presence the Trade Practices Commission has in today's marketplace. The Trade Practices Commission has stamped itself as a serious watchdog for small business and shown that it is prepared for its coming change to form the new super-watchdog, the Competition and Consumer Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of late the Trade Practices Commission has stepped up its surveillance and enforcement of the act to protect the interests of small business and consumers. A recent example of consumer protection is the AMP case&mdash;and the best example yet. Policyholders in this case were protected against an attempt by Australia's biggest life insurance company to near-on fraudulently deny full and proper superannuation payouts simply based upon a trumped up technicality in the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the Trade Practices Commission forced the AMP to pay out well over $50 million to the policyholders&mdash;the largest payout in Australian corporate history. I single out the AMP Society's case as it is without doubt the biggest example of an attempt at big business deception. But there are many others. For example, the consumer protection carried out by the Trade Practices Commission in imposing a $5 million fine on Ansett and TNT after being found guilty of price collusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presently, the Trade Practices Commission is inquiring into price collusion between 1991 and 1992 between Mobil, Shell and BP which had the effect of reducing competition in petrol retailing. In the very same industry the Trade Practices Commission was able to negotiate a fair outcome for independent wholesalers and retailers before allowing the Caltex-Ampol merger to go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the retail sector, the Trade Practices Commission has shown its mettle, firstly, by investigating the treatment meted out to retailers by the managers of the nation's biggest shopping centres. It is not just the small retailers who were complaining. Many of the biggest fashion houses and chains were smarting at the way rents were set, outgoings determined and moves within centres negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission has created a great deal of controversy through these decisions and a great deal of animosity from big business who are predictably calling for the scalp of the chairman, Professor Allan Fels. However, the old adage is: if they are not criticising you, you are not doing your job. And this is a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many more examples that time does not permit me to mention. If the Trade Practices Commission did not intervene, big business would distort the competitiveness of the marketplace to the detriment of small business and the consumer. This is why it is so important that the Trade Practices Commission's current powers be translated without any loss to the proposed commission. Moreover, it is important to retain the culture now built up around the Trade Practices Commission so as to prevent free-wheeling competition. If not, then the competition bill before us will fail miserably and we will be back in this chamber making the necessary amendments after so many have paid a very high price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Competition Policy Reform Bill is possibly one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this chamber, because it underscores and emphasises once and for all the very damaging direction in which this government is taking the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot legislate for goodness. However, a government can, over time, pass a series of laws which so undermine the fabric of society that anti-social behaviour flourishes and the moral and cultural cement that binds citizens together in a society is inexorably dissolved. The bill before us today marks one of the stages of that dissolution&mdash;just one of the stages. For over 200 years Australians have built up a culture of tolerance and mutual helpfulness. In the few short years of this Labor government, first under Prime Minister Hawke and now under Prime Minister Keating, this mutual respect and support one for the other has been steadily eroded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it has been done deliberately, it has not been done with the intent of undermining important Australian values. Just as the road to hell is paved with good intentions, so the intentions of the economic rationalists are laudable&mdash;to make Australian industry, the Australian economy and Australian society more efficient; to have everyone working harder and producing more in competition each with the other and with those in other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intentions are laudable, but nonetheless dangerous and their erosive effect on our culture and our social life is everywhere to be seen by those with eyes not blinded by the religious ecstasy of economic rationalist ideology. The simplistic economics which began to pervade our schools of economics after the Second World War spread the landmines which are now exploding and destroying our humanity. Not only did this new economic orthodoxy ignore the real world, cutting and hacking at the real world to make it fit its preconceived and simple models, it turned its back on the broad humanitarian context in which many earlier academic economists embedded their economic theories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the simple dictionary used by the economic rationalists: competition, market forces, level playing field, economic growth as a sine qua non of human welfare, `the market says', deregulation, smaller government, less tax, consumers instead of people. And so it goes on. Its basis is the stupid and hazardous assumption that humans are driven by an insatiable material greed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the economic rationalism of the 1990s may be viewed as the reincarnation of the laissez faire of the 1890s, so the legislation before us might be viewed as the 1990s version of the social Darwinism which accompanied that earlier avaricious age. By the 1960s the portents of this misdirection were plain to many, and many railed against the path that Western industrialisation seemed intent on taking. There were individuals who saw what lay ahead. As a group, humans seemed destined to behave like lemmings, hurling themselves towards the cliff edge, not heeding the warnings. In 1967 J.K. Galbraith, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Industrial State</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I remember when this was written&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we continue to believe that the goals of the industrial system&mdash;the expansion of output, the companion increase in consumption, technological advance, the public images that sustain it&mdash;are coordinate with life, then all of our lives will be in the service of these goals. What is consistent with these ends we shall have or be allowed; all else will be off limits. Our wants will be managed in accordance with the needs of the industrial system; the policies of the state will be subject to similar influence; education will be adapted to industrial need; the disciplines required by the industrial system will be the conventional morality of the community. All other goals will be made to seem precious, unimportant or antisocial. We will be bound to the ends of the industrial system. The state will add its moral, and perhaps some of its legal, power to their enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA>If I could interpolate, that is precisely what this legislation is doing. Galbraith went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What will eventuate, on the whole, will be the benign servitude of the household retainer who is taught to love her mistress and see her interests as her own, and not the compelled servitude of the field hand. But it will not be freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on the other hand, the industrial system is only a part, and relatively a diminishing part, of life, there is much less occasion for concern. Aesthetic goals will have pride of place; those who serve them will not be subject to the goals of the industrial system; the industrial system itself will be subordinate to the claims of these dimensions of life. Intellectual preparation will be for its own sake and not for the better service to the industrial system. Men will not be entrapped by the belief that apart from the goals of the industrial system&mdash;apart from the production of goods and income by progressively more advanced technical methods&mdash;there is nothing important in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foregoing being so, we may, over time, come to see the industrial system in fitting light as an essentially technical arrangement for providing convenient goods and services in adequate volume. Those who rise through its bureaucracy will so see themselves. And the public consequences will be in keeping, for if economic goals are the only goals of the society it is natural that the industrial system should dominate the state and the state should serve its ends. If other goals are strongly asserted, the industrial system will fall into its place as a detached and autonomous arm of the state, but responsible to the larger purposes of the society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen wherein the chance for salvation lies. The industrial system, in contrast with its economic antecedents, is intellectually demanding. It brings into existence, to serve its intellectual and scientific needs, the community that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is what Galbraith finished on in 1967&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">hopefully, will reject its monopoly of social purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>Galbraith was there expressing the hope that the community would reject the monopoly of the industrial system. That hope has not been fulfilled. Indeed, in this bill we are further cementing that monopoly of purpose. What this government has done, and will extend with this legislation, is elevate to a position of pre-eminence just one characteristic of our humanity, our economic competitiveness. This is just one aspect of our humanity, and it is not the most important. The government seeks to smother all other human characteristics with this one characteristic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn now to just one example which has been developing in western New South Wales in relation to the silliness and narrowness of the approach which the government is using. By its nature, what the government is proposing would divide, industry by industry; would seek the best bottom line for each industry, again industry by industry; and would ignore many of the external costs&mdash;what economists call externalities&mdash;and fail to write those adequately into the proper costs of goods and services. Therefore, the bottom lines would not represent the best interests of society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even by proper economic measures, the sorts of measures which this government has been pursuing and which it is pursuing in this legislation are not going to serve our best interests. In the generation of electricity, for example, one sees problems of massive air pollution. Where do the costs of that air pollution appear? In the privatisation of the electricity utilities in this country in the break-up between generators, distributors and final sales organisations, where are the costs of the air pollution of that generation going to appear? That requires governments to regulate&mdash;and preferably to impose, by way of a tax on the cost of electricity, a moiety which represents those external costs&mdash;the costs which are not borne directly by the generators, and therefore not borne directly by those who consume the electricity, but are borne very widely by the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In generating our electricity from coal, we deplete a non-renewable resource, a resource on which future generations of humans also have claim. Where do the legitimate claims of future generations appear in the current price of electricity and where will they appear within the simplistic competitive model?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said in this chamber about the problems of greenhouse, which will impact in terms of environmental damage on future generations. How are their needs and those costs going to be registered within this simple model of bottom line economics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, in the energy area, there are a number of cross-industry comparisons that need to be made. Are we going to see, as I suspect we are, competition within the electricity industry in isolation from other ways of providing for the energy needs of people? For example, in many of the remote areas, it would be cheaper to provide alternative sources of energy rather than providing electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we going to see competition between the electricity suppliers to supply electricity into those areas at least cost? I suspect that is exactly what we are going to see. As a good example, in relation to western New South Wales, under the Greiner government&mdash;a government of the Right, a government given to energy efficiency and reducing government employees&mdash;we saw the minister for energy, Neil Pickard, get rid of his energy advisers and then proceed to conduct an inquiry into the provision of electricity to western New South Wales. Not surprisingly, what we saw then was advice coming to him from people in the electricity industry. They were the only people left to provide that sort of advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then saw the government of New South Wales go ahead with a massive 4,200-kilometre grid extension at enormous cost to provide electricity to a very few consumers in western New South Wales. I understand the cost to provide just the grid connection for that electricity worked out at some $88,000 per household. The government chose to subsidise that cost and said to people living in that area, `You can have an electricity connection for only $55,000'. Of course, those remote stations, which had already gone into solar and wind generators backed up with diesel and battery, found that they could provide an alternative source of electricity for themselves for only $35,000. So, not surprisingly, the very expensive building of that grid system has not provided the connections it might have provided and it therefore has not returned the benefits to the state of New South Wales that it might have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there is a lesson here in that one saw electricity being treated as a commodity on its own. Sure, one could have competition within that; one might get the least cost of electricity, but that is not to say that one would necessarily get the least cost of the energy services which electricity in a number of other moieties would make possible. Only in that way, with proper costing, with the full internalisation of externalities, will one see the best interests of society served, even in an economic sense. I do not believe that this legislation is moving us in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I believe that this legislation is very wrongly conceived. Not surprisingly, of course, it is conceived in the same context that much government legislation has been conceived in in recent years. It makes assumptions that are faulty about the nature of human beings, and it makes assumptions that are incomplete and damaging because of the importance it gives to that one characteristic of seeking to fulfil an endless and insatiable material greed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have seen what was happening to our society: Galbraith was just one. Many people writing in the 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s warned us of what lay ahead. Unfortunately, we have gone ahead and are putting our heads further into the noose with this legislation, and I believe as a society we will be the poorer. I believe this legislation and the whole ideology that goes with it should not be supported. We need to turn around, we need to go back the other way; we are heading up a blind alley. It will cost us a great deal materially in dollars as well as in our humanity. For all those reasons this legislation should not be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments about the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. In defence of the government and those of us who support this reform bill, I think that Senator Coulter has misread the motives behind the whole competition policy reform agenda. Certainly to suggest that enhancing competition and making particularly government-owned business enterprises and government monopolies more open to competition is somehow a policy that is designed to only assist people's insatiable material greed is not sustainable on the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, it is a fact that if we do not have efficient production of power&mdash;even Senator Coulter in his speech did draw the Senate's attention to this&mdash;and we do not have a sensible system of providing power and alternatives in power to people, they will not make the right choices. If we have a system whereby there are massive taxpayer subsidies for the provision of power, people's decisions as to whether to use power off a grid, power generated by the burning of fossil fuels, power used by nuclear generation or power by wind or water&mdash;hydropower as it is called&mdash;will be distorted. That distortion will take place because people will decide quite sensibly what is the most cost effective way for them to gain the power they need to run their households or their industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are hidden subsidies, they will act as one of the incentives for people to use what may not necessarily be the most environmentally friendly form of power. People will even use power that is in the short term more expensive for them, because they cannot afford the up-front capital costs of providing longer term and often less expensive power generation that comes from hydro-electricity, solar generation, tidal or wind power. That is because, historically, governments have made massive investments in power generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Western Australia, coal power generation is a very recent example. Governments have made massive infrastructure investments to provide power from those generation facilities, often not necessarily with economic motives at heart. Often a range of even political decisions can come into place when they are building those sorts of facilities. If citizens want to look at producing power from a wind turbine in their backyard or a solar hot water system in their roof, the taxpayer has to meet the up-front costs of providing that power. Certainly, in the short term, they can be a lot higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to respond a little to what Senator Coulter said. The point of what I have been saying is that if we have better competition and more obvious government subsidies, rather than hidden subsidies, people will be able to make more sensible decisions and will be able, probably for the first time in many people's lives, to make decisions based on a whole range of rationales. Senator Coulter was making the point that this has all been driven by economic rationale. But if you do not get the economics right, it is very hard for people to make decisions based on other important rationales, be they environmental, heritage, cultural or other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points that should be made about the competition reform policy, as it has been put forward by this government, is that it certainly makes some advances in competition policy across the nation between the states, and in the reform of some of the uncompetitive practices by both state and federal governments in the past&mdash;and, as has been outlined, by a range of other sectors of the economy. Where it is lacking, and where there is an enormous need for reform in Australia&mdash;a reform area that this government has been incapable of dealing with in any significant way&mdash;is in a number of other areas in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations is an area that stands out head and shoulders above just about all the other areas of this nation's economy. The work force forms an important part of that economy. Our industrial relations system is so far out of touch with international reality in terms of what production and international competitiveness we must achieve, that it is a disgrace. The reality of our industrial relations system is that it creates a totally non-competitive environment for many people in this nation. One of the most severely affected portions of that population, particularly the working age population, is young people because the industrial relations system has delivered to Australia some of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the world. After 12 years of the Australian Labor Party government, the percentage of youth unemployment has not changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Statistics last week issued its social trends publication which showed&mdash;and I do not have it in front of me, so the Senate will just have to trust me&mdash;that in 1983 the youth unemployment figure was around 23.5 per cent. Now, in 1995, the figure is something like 23.8 per cent. That figure has fluctuated a little during that period but the youth unemployment statistic is as bad today in June 1995 as it was during the depths of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important part of the Australian community is suffering an enormous amount of pain because this government will not apply the principles of competition in industrial relations policies. By saying we put the principles of competition into industrial relations policy or workplace relationships, it does not mean open slather in the workplace. There needs to be&mdash;and it is important that there is&mdash;protection in terms of standards and conditions at the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those standards and conditions have been fought for by trade unions over generations. It is important that trade unions maintain an important role in workplaces to help people there ensure that wages and conditions, and other aspects of employment, are protected. That certainly should go without saying. Unless we have an industrial relations system that allows flexibility and ensures that productivity is enhanced and Australia's workplaces compete internationally, Australia will fall further and further behind. Our living standards will continue to deteriorate in comparison with those of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of reform where this government has failed to act&mdash;I presume because of the power and influence of the trade unions within the Labor party organisation&mdash;is in coastal shipping. It is crucial that a nation that has a coastline as long as Australia's and a maritime history as great, and which has the natural advantages we gain from having some of the world's best natural and artificial harbours, ensures that our coastal shipping&mdash;that trade and commerce carried on from international shipping and the shipping that plies the Australian coast&mdash;is very efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should ensure that businesses in Australia and those that seek to trade internationally have a very effective and efficient means of transport around our coasts. We know that with cabotage and a number of other restrictive practices which apply to shipping off our coast, this is simply not the case, although it could be fixed very quickly. Equally, in relation to trans-Tasman shipping, we have across the Tasman a closed shop in relation to unions working on trans-Tasman trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the Tasman, in New Zealand, there is a nation that has gone through a bit of an economic miracle at the moment. We should not overstate it, but New Zealand has come from a very poor base in the 1970s through some very hard decisions by the David Lange and Roger Douglas government, followed by Mr Bolger's government. They have taken some very tough decisions. That nation is re-emerging with an emerging economy. A lot of goods can be traded across the Tasman for the mutual benefit of Australian citizens who seek to buy goods from New Zealand and, of course, New Zealanders who we would hope would buy goods from us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a lighter aside, the incredible year or so that New Zealand has had both in terms of the economy and sporting ventures suffered a little setback on Saturday night when it fell to the Springboks. Other than that, it is doing quite well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be serious, trans-Tasman shipping is an important link. Waterfront reform in New Zealand has far outpaced our waterfront reform. The waterfront reforms that were ushered through by Senator Collins when he was the minister have seen some improvements on the Australian waterfront. However, they have not given Australia any net comparative advantage over waterfronts in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very good to have reform. It is very good to have progress and improvement on the waterfront. However, unless we are improving relative to our trading partners&mdash;New Zealand is a very important one&mdash;we are not improving. It is no good, for example, to be running faster if a competitor is running even faster again. One does not win the race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will reiterate the reforms. There are the industrial relations reforms, reforms to coastal shipping and reforms to trans-Tasman shipping, where a union to union deal excludes other flagged vessels from plying that trade. Reform on the waterfront will ultimately ensure that Australia's living standards deteriorate in comparison to those of our trading partners. Waterfront reform has an important place in our economic life. It makes Australia an efficient trading nation for the benefit of all of our citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms that were ushered through the waterfront while Senator Collins was the minister did make some improvements. One problem that exists is that we still have this absolute monopoly over waterfront labour by the unions. We saw in Western Australia only a matter of weeks ago the consequences of a new stevedoring business being established using non-union labour. The other union-dominated stevedoring companies closed down all ports across Australia for 24 hours, again to ensure that their monopoly control over waterfront labour stayed in place. That situation cannot be allowed to occur. As hard as it will be for waterfront unions and the Australian Labor Party to accept it, there needs to be reform of waterfront labour in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) is now in the Senate. He will recognise, even begrudgingly, that if we do not have a waterfront that is up to international best practice, our exporters and those who import into Australia will suffer a disadvantage that they do not need to suffer. As hard as that may be for waterfront unions which have achieved a position of privilege in that part of the Australian economy, they need to understand that sooner or later that will change. The best way to ensure that that change does not hurt them too much and that it does not hurt the country any more than it has for the last decade is for them to embrace competition positively. I certainly will not hold my breath waiting for that to happen. It is a great shame that the government's commitment to competition does not go to those very crucial areas in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts and certainly Senator Coulter referred to the environment. Competition does not have to harm the environment. Plenty of evidence around the world shows that, where there is not effective competition, particularly in the area of water services, power, which I have already described, and the management of forest resources, there can often be enormous amounts of waste. That waste will cost all Australians dearly both in terms of what they pay for those services and commodities&mdash;be it timber out of the forests or management for environmental values&mdash;and in how it will harm the environment. Wasting water in a dry environment like Australia ultimately damages the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So competition policy does not necessarily have to be the bogyman for the environment that people like the Greens from Western Australia and Senator Coulter will always have us believe. Competition can be a very positive factor for environmental management and long-term environmental sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas of competition are very important. An important principle is that competition cannot be a partial thing. For example, in the Commonwealth's own provision of services through some of the DAS businesses there has been a massive opening up to competition from the private sector in providing services to government. But we have to make sure when we open up things for competition that there is competition and contestability at all levels. I do not want to pick on the DAS businesses because they have been making a lot of progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dasfleet is the government's hire car company. We cannot say that we will untie certain sections of it but not others. We may find that it is much better for the Australian taxpayer to ensure that the private sector can get more actively involved, for example, in the provision of cars to the Commonwealth fleet. Where one ensures that there is competition for the provision of services, ultimately the taxpayer will benefit and the Australian economy will become that much more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was listening this morning to 2UE when Alan Jones was talking about another start-up airline coming to Australia. It reminds me of the problem that happens when competition in the air is created, which is what we have had since the two-airline agreement was thankfully demolished a few years ago. However, on the ground, the Commonwealth has provided massive infrastructure over the past decades, particularly in terms of the terminals, the terminal facilities, the runways and all the other massive expensive infrastructure that has gone into our airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not really help Australia's competitiveness both in domestic and international travel if we go to potential airline operators and say, `We're quite happy for you to compete in the skies, but when you get to the terminals you will go to Qantas or Ansett and ask them very kindly if they will let you have a terminal at gate 57, and a check-in counter, if you're lucky, stuck around the corner near the dunnies in the airport somewhere'. If we are going to ensure that Australia achieves the benefits of competition, we have to ensure that that principle is applied all the way through some of these enterprises, particularly some of the former monopolies owned by the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few seconds remaining to me, I congratulate the government and the heads of government who sat around and worked out this competition policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 represents one of the greatest triumphs of economic rationalism over the basic needs of everyday people. It is a bill that the Australian Democrats oppose. The Democrats have continually spoken in the Senate about the dangers of trying to impose an economic model of competition on social and welfare services.

The Democrats' concern with this bill is reflected across the wide range of community organisations, including the same groups that have expressed concern at the Industry Commission's approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Council of Social Service, representing a wide range of service groups, has called for any reform of regulatory processes to enhance existing social and environmental protections. There is a real danger that this legislation will have the opposite effect. As ACOSS has said, there is still no clear statement of commitment to the principle of universal access at reasonable cost to all essential public utilities and social services. This means that it will be virtually impossible to address any reductions in community and social services which occur as a result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put on the record some comments which the Sydney City Mission has included in its submission in response to the Industry Commission's draft report on its inquiry into charities. The words that are written here apply very clearly not only to the report of the Industry Commission but also to competition policy in whatever guise it comes in terms of social and welfare services. The Sydney City Mission's response to the draft recommendations from the Industry Commission inquiry into charities was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth and state/territory governments should develop a set of principles for the selection of service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications should be called by open tender.</PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney City Mission comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The finding of the Draft Report that an open tender process is the best method by which to achieve efficiency and increased client outcomes needs to be questioned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tendering process leads to direct competition between agencies which may have adverse effects on the wider social/community services sector, acting against co-operation and integration. There is scant attention to a community planning process and no opportunity for input by consumers of the proposed services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opening up of all services to for-profit delivery (presuming "open tender" means open to all organisations including for profit organisations) could lead to a two-tiered system with those least able to pay relying on a residual welfare system. Whilst those who can afford to pay for services without hardship should do so, most community service users cannot pay market prices but should still have access to quality service provision as a matter of right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The apparent assumption by the Commission that for-profit delivery of services is superior, lacks any basis in fact. It is likely rather to limit choices, reduce access and disadvantage clients. For-profit deliverers expect a return on capital. The motivation of the not-for-profits is the satisfaction of the customer and the provision of quality services that meet a community need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tendering agreements are generally for fixed periods. There is therefore the need at some point, to re-tender. The issues of the importance of continuity of relationships, the need for stability and the avoidance of unnecessary disruption have not been addressed. It is difficult enough now for a person in need to find their way through to the appropriate community service without increasing the difficulty of access through constant change.</PARA>
<PARA>Another concern which the Democrats have with the competition policy is its potential impact on rural Australia and rural industry. People in rural Australia have been bearing the burden of reduction in services and economic restructuring for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell honourable senators a story. In the 1970s there was on most road maps in Queensland a dot with the title of Roxborough Downs. It was a very large cattle station in western Queensland. As a Methodist minister in Cloncurry, I visited this cattle station on one occasion and it was a most eerie experience. I drove into the small community which consisted of a main homestead, a number of quarters for stockmen, a couple of cottages for married couples, a machinery shed, et cetera. In all, there were about a dozen substantial buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it eerie to wander into stockmen's quarters and see magazines on beds, to find in the main homestead dishes in the sink, account books strewed on a desk and even knives and forks in a bureau. As I wandered around I saw absolutely no people and no sign of any activity. What had happened was that some months before, Roxborough Downs had been bought by one of the large pastoral companies which, out of concern for economic efficiency, had removed all of the staff&mdash;a permanent community of some 20 or 30 people. For the sake of economic efficiency, the company totally replaced that permanent community with an occasional mustering of cattle for market and an even more occasional and casual care of that very large property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Are there not other values besides economic efficiency? Now that economic efficiency had removed that community, who would maintain the fencing? Who would eradicate the weeds and feral animals? Who was going to care properly for the stock? Who would be there to repair damage to degraded land? Who was going to maintain communities and people in rural areas when economic efficiency was ruling and overcoming all of these other values? Instead, in rural communities in Australia during the last 20 or 30 years we have seen a total exodus of people, resources and hope from the bush. I confidently predict that this bill, if passed, will accelerate that process. Whilst this story comes from 20 years ago, it is an indication of the possible outcomes when the doctrine of competition and economic efficiency is applied without concern for the social, environmental and cultural impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have one other example of the potential impact on a specific rural industry. Mr Harry Bonanno from the Queensland Cane Growers Council said in a media statement that the national competition policy poses a serious threat to the continued export earning ability of the Queensland sugar industry. Mr Bonanno summed up the basic issue clearly when he said, `Despite the non-competitive nature of many industry functions, such as milling and marketing, it is not difficult to justify these arrangements on the basis of public benefit.' He warned that the national competition policy had the potential to cause severe disruption to Australia's sugar production, processing and marketing arrangements. He gave the worse case scenario in which the sugar industry would be divided and warned of the damage to its capacity to operate competitively on the corrupted world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to remind the Senate that, despite the `level playing field' ideal promoted by the government and consistently supported by the coalition parties, the sugar industry is certainly not the only commodity where the world market is highly corrupt. Only market fundamentalists whose minds are made up and who do not want to be disturbed by what has happened in other countries which have gone down this road would espouse this madness. The Democrats will not support legislation that ignores the effects on people and the community, in pursuit of a mythical economic ideology . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to add my support to the coalition on this bill that is now before the Senate. The Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 is a very vital piece of legislation for Australia. The national competition reforms can lower business costs, promote new investments and create new jobs. Senator Woodley outlined what I think are largely some of the possible downsides without really coming to grips with the benefits of this reform. Senator Woodley, as is the case in many areas of economic and social policy, it is a matter of managing new reforms in such a way that the downsides are reduced but of gaining the enormous benefits that come from greater economic competition within our national economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one major downside that I worry about considerably in terms of the government's commitment to this. It is part of an economic reform agenda that this government says it is trying to implement, but I think it is a great pity&mdash;and I would like to make this point at the start&mdash;that, even though there has been reform in fair measure through our economy by the private sector right through the 1980s and 1990s and in some areas of the public service, the great stumbling block in this economy still is labour market reform, and this government still refuses to implement proper and meaningful labour market reform. We still have a Clayton's version of this. I will put that to one side at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hilmer reforms that have sparked this bill really do address a real need in our economy; that is, the reform of the public sector enterprises to make them far more competitive. This is very welcome because Australia is still not fully modernised to compete in the world economy. Up until now, only part of the economy has been subjected to proper competition. Since 1974, the corporate sector has had to live with the competitive environment that the Trade Practices Act has created for it. It is welcome that this is now extended, in the way indicated by the Hilmer reforms, to essential services that are provided by the government. To put this into perspective, 10 per cent of GDP of this country is involved in the business and commercial enterprises of government. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that that become part of a competitive framework in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is an example of cooperative federalism at work. As people would be aware&mdash;and I need not remind senators&mdash;most government enterprises in this country are state based, and a federal bill of this nature is not going to work without the cooperation of the states. A majority of the states which have coalition governments have agreed to work with this ALP government to adopt these competition policies. At the federal level of government, the bill establishes two new bodies to oversee the implementation of reforms: the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which is the administrative and enforcement bureau; and the National Competition Council, which is the policy advice bureau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states and territories will have performance indicators measuring efficiency and competition that have to be met in such utility areas as gas, electricity, water, and road transport over the coming years. If these indicators are met, as judged by the National Competition Council, the states will benefit from additional federal income. It is important to underline the potential benefits of this increased competition to the government sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attention of the community should really be drawn to the dollar gains for the Australian economy if we increase efficiency based on this sort of competition. The Industry Commission report of March 1995 places in perspective the benefits that will flow from the Hilmer and associated reforms. It is estimated that all reforms will add 5.5 per cent to Australia's GDP. With the present value of GDP at $470 billion, we are talking about the equivalent of $23 billion of additional national wealth. As I have indicated, the onus is on the states to perform and reform under this cooperative legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the Industry Commission estimated that the consumers will reap $9 billion of benefit, or $1,500 per household, from these competitive reforms. The Industry Commission report puts the importance of the states' contribution to reform in context. The Commonwealth will  contribute about $4 billion of the overall $23 billion of GDP increases; the state business reforms will contribute $19 billion of the $23 billion. Professor Hilmer nailed down the pivotal role of the states in achieving this growth in revenue and benefits when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This national competition policy is not just an agreement to be signed; it is a raft of difficult reforms to be implemented over many years.</PARA>
<PARA>The carrot for the states to act is the promise of receiving additional Commonwealth moneys&mdash;indeed, the Industry Commission speaks of an additional $3 billion in extra revenue to be shared by the states if this entire reform program is activated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very necessary&mdash;it is essential&mdash;that we do this, because most of the government monopolies have evolved over a very long period of time and, having been totally sheltered from competition, have grown inefficient in the ways in which they operate and do not, like many businesses, search for new markets. An example of this is best illustrated by the electricity generation industry in this country. I would like to use the example of my own state of New South Wales, which has undertaken a considerable number of reforms over recent years and has become more efficient, but is missing the essential efficiencies that will come to electricity distribution in this country if we link the systems across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing, given the 45 years we have had a power system in this country which has high tension transmission, that all these transmissions stay in their own states&mdash;they do not link to states nearby. This is incredibly inefficient. I will explain the basic problem. When you build an isolated power system for one state, you need to add about one-third of the capacity to allow for breakdowns and for peak loads. If you link the electricity systems of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, you can move loads across the system when a breakdown occurs and when peak loads vary, so you do not have to build as many power stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s, that sort of facility was not available to New South Wales. Neville Wran woke up one morning, turned on the shower and had a cold shower because the whole system had reached overcapacity. That cold shower has cost New South Wales billions of dollars, because he embarked on a major expansion of the power generation system in New South Wales. We have now reached the situation where we have surplus capacity and cannot use all the electricity that we produce. If we were linked properly into Victoria and Queensland, we could on-sell our cheaper power and this would cut our costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of that equation, going back to the early 1980s, if we had been linked in at that point to the other grid systems, Neville Wran would not have had to build so many power stations. The effect of that would have been to keep the price of electricity in New South Wales lower than it is at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all in the past and we must learn the lessons of that. It is heartening that there are some moves to create those links now. It is also heartening to see our new Labor government in New South Wales cooperating in some of this reform agenda. Unfortunately, the signals are very mixed at this stage. On the one hand, Premier Carr has referred to the calling of tenders for the provision of certain services to see if outside contractors can provide them more cheaply but without the loss of quality and availability. That is welcomed but I would remind the Senate that he is building on the achievements of the Greiner and Fahey coalition governments in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat ironic that Premier Carr, when in opposition, castigated these valuable reforms, trying to frighten the public of New South Wales at that time. Now that he is supporting them, he stands guilty of political opportunism in taking up public service job cuts, price rises and loss of public revenue. He knew he was misleading the people of New South Wales; now he embraces this sort of competitive reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Or does he? The New South Wales Left in the Carr cabinet is showing signs of spoking the reforms he is proposing in New South Wales. New South Wales is already dropping behind Queensland on reform of transport costs to industry. Queensland has elected to go further than New South Wales with reform of transport infrastructure and this difference in the pace of reform gives Queensland coal producers a bigger advantage over the New South Wales producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales companies will not get access to the reform benefits unless the Carr government enthusiastically supports competitive reform in this area. Coal companies in the New South Wales Hunter Valley and mines in the north-west of New South Wales&mdash;places like Boggabri, Gunnedah and Ulan&mdash;will be the big losers. In Australia, we are already at a severe disadvantage in our competition with other countries on freight rates. Our freights are something like $7 a tonne. We have to reduce this by about $3 to be world competitive in the coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carr government will kill competition in this industry in New South Wales if it fails to keep pace with the Queensland reforms. The Hunter Valley rail project is waiting to invest millions in improved infrastructure but will reconsider its options as things stand under this new state Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, however, the coalition applauds the reforms indicated in this bill but, as usual, the rhetoric of the Keating government is not exactly being matched by action. The ALP is the captive of the ACTU leadership and these reforms do not cover the labour market. Our export processed goods&mdash;such as meat, wool, sugar and specialist manufactured items&mdash;are all exposed to competition on prices in world markets. But under the ALP, the labour market is totally insulated from the realities of world competition. In some of the processing industries our labour cost components are twice those of our competitors. Also, this government has substantially weakened the secondary boycott provisions in the Trade Practices Act, which means that big and small businesses are constantly exposed to potential unfair union threats and actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a similar pattern of inaction in reform in a number of other federal areas which, if the reforms were implemented, would greatly complement what is proposed in this competition policy bill. I will mention just a few. In aviation policy, the government's commitment to reform fell over at the first hurdle when it reneged on the trans-Tasman integration agreement. Competition and reform in our ports is another area where this government has had a dismal record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came into this chamber the big issue of the day was whether the then transport minister&mdash;now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy&mdash;Bob Collins, would resign if he had not reformed the waterfront in 12 months. We all heard him boast of his proud record in this area, but by late 1994 the port of Sydney ranked 31 out of 44 in the world productivity stakes. That represented a deterioration, and we are getting worse, not better, in the area of waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where reforms have not proceeded is that of cultural policy. A report by the Prices Surveillance Authority two years ago recommended the Keating government deliver world competitive prices for compact discs to Australian consumers. All of us who are great consumers of compact discs would look forward to that reform quite eagerly if it dropped prices. But the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, as he does on many things, backed away from that decision to offer greater efficiency and lower prices to Australian music lovers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we come to another reform agenda of this government and, given the record I have just outlined, we approach it with some trepidation. Over the years, the government's rhetoric on reform&mdash;economic reform, in particular&mdash;has sounded terrific but, if you look at the real world, it has not delivered in the areas I have indicated. We live in hope that the Competition Policy Reform Bill could be an exception. Let us hope so because I believe that it will be one of the most significant reforms of the economy ever undertaken&mdash;the actual opportunity to take an inefficient monopolistic structure and move it into a fully competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The COAG meeting has signed off on this and it has received support across all governments. The national competition regime must operate in all sectors of the economy. The referral of this bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee was an important exercise because it brought out some of the problems that are likely to be encountered with this sort of legislation. We recall how it all went through so quickly with COAG in the end, leaving us with some reservations about whether it would cover all the downsides that have been indicated, some of them by Senator Woodley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that Senate inquiry, small business groups and local government groups expressed particular concerns about some of the downsides of this legislation. Small business concerns about the concentration of market power in the hands of fewer people are legitimate, and I have raised such matters in the Senate on a number of occasions in recent times, and continuing concerns, under the reforms proposed by this bill, must be monitored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the view that relaxation of some regulations could lead to the lowering of standards of service is also a legitimate concern. The reform process is very complex and we must be on the lookout for possible anomalies and problems thrown up unexpectedly by this process of competition reform because, with the best will in the world and with the best structures, it is not always possible for governments to see ahead to some of the intricacies of the effects of this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure has had a very long gestation period. I welcome the birth of the national competition reform embodied in this bill. I look forward to its full implementation under the leadership of John Howard in the next coalition government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. I will begin with a few comments with regard to the consumer elements of the Hilmer reforms. The fact is that various consumer groups have never given anything other than heavily qualified support to the Hilmer reform package. For example, the Australian Consumers Association warned the government that competition in itself was not necessarily a good thing, and unless key design issues were fixed there would continue to be significant failures in the marketplace in regard to competition, efficiency, access, and fairness for consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the association sought to ensure that the bill contains a statement ensuring that the competition benefits are intended to flow through to the consumers&mdash;not to state governments as higher revenue and not to the corporate members of the Business Council of Australia as higher sales and profits, but to the consumers. After all, this is what competition is supposed to be about: delivering a benefit in better prices or greater choice to the consumer. That is something which is often completely forgotten in this debate when many people start talking about `competition' as some sort of an end in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It often seems to me that people aspire not towards getting a better deal for consumers but simply towards creating competition for competition's sake. That frequently proves to be a mistake&mdash;especially when we are talking about services or goods which are not responsive to the normal patterns of supply and demand. In any event, the government has failed to include in the bill any statement which reflects the goal of competition benefits flowing through to consumers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be seeking to amend the bill to insert that fundamental principle back into it. Consumer groups also sought to ensure that the government recognised in the bill the necessity for government to continue to look after the interests of disadvantaged consumers. That has not happened either. The government did agree to insert a wishy-washy objects clause and to change the name of the bill, but that was all. There was nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the moderate request from the consumer movement to guarantee that at least two of the members of the National Competition Council have a background in consumer protection was rejected. Under the benchmarks set by the consumer movement the key failing of the bill&mdash;and the agreements&mdash;is its failure to adequately outline a means of testing the public benefit of competition. The Australian Consumers Association has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competition policy must be set against the backdrop of the society in which it operates and be in harmony with other social policies. The overall public interest includes such factors as social equity and the natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly it cannot be simply a matter of administrative fiat to determine pubic interest in assessing whether declarations should be made or authorities granted under the regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be substantial public consultation and an appropriate degree of transparency in decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless consumers can exercise their market power through enhanced choice, education, information, redress and access&mdash;unless disadvantaged consumers can continue to obtain fair and reasonable access to essential goods and services&mdash;through price, availability and supports&mdash;unless the amenity and welfare provided by the built and natural environment is maintained and enhanced&mdash;through appropriate regulation, economic instrument and incentive&mdash;there can be no net public benefits. Only inappropriate private benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats wholeheartedly support that premise. If the bill and the agreements which underpin it met this benchmark we would support it. That they do not is an indictment on this government and a clear signal that this bill is about private benefits, not about benefit to Australian consumers at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We note that the government has agreed to an interpretation clause in the competition principle agreement signed by the states which could allow for some of these issues to be considered `where relevant' and `without limiting the matters which will be taken into account'. Of course, I have great doubts that premiers like Mr Kennett in Victoria and Mr Brown in my own home state of South Australia will ever regard issues like the interests of consumers, social welfare and equity considerations or policies relating to ecological sustainability as relevant to their narrow visions of the world. I suppose we should be thankful for small mercies and we are pleased to see at least the inclusion of this weak measure in the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us, however, which deals with the legislative changes affecting the federal government's own GBEs, access to infrastructure, and definition of business, contains no such statement. In the committee stage the Democrats will be seeking to rectify this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weakening of the former powers of the Prices Surveillance Authority to set up prices in some industries and conduct appropriate surveillance and gather adequate information is one example of how this bill is failing the consumer. Monitoring and reporting is an important activity, but to constrain the ACCC's prices surveillance activities at just this level is to leave it with very few teeth to deal with market failures when they do occur. Of course, looking through the Hilmer rose-tinted glasses we are supposed to believe that competition will ensure that markets do not fail. Of course, only an ideologue would believe in that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to put a request to the government that the Australian Taxation Office prefix tax rulings and tax determinations with what is referred to in bills passing through the parliament as the key principle: that is, an explanation or brief summary of the coverage and purpose of the legislation. Tax rulings and determinations are issuing from the Australian Taxation Office at the rate of approximately one each working day. These documents reflect the Australian Taxation Office's view of the legislation; however, they do not necessarily always conform to any precedent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity of our tax laws is such that it is absolutely necessary to have these determinations and tax rulings to explain what the law is because in an environment of self-assessment, certainty before the law is very important. Quite often these tax rulings and tax determinations are quite lengthy documents; I have known them to approximate 50 pages. Reading each of these daily documents is a time-consuming task for busy taxpayers, tax agents and tax advisers. Therefore, I believe that if we adopted this concept of the key principle in relation to each tax determination and ruling it would enhance the quality of the document and make it a lot easier for people to understand&mdash;particularly those who merely want a brief overview. I commend this suggestion to the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to make some remarks on a visit that I had the good fortune to make to Britain between Wednesday, 26 April and Friday, 12 May this year. I was a delegate on behalf of this parliament at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association seminar in London. I want to thank my colleagues in the federal Labor Party caucus and my colleagues in the Australian parliament for the opportunity to attend that seminar, which I found to be not only very informative and worth while but also fairly enjoyable from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one of four Australian delegates. The other three representatives were from the states&mdash;Mr Patrick Rogan, from New South Wales; Mr Ken McElligott, from Queensland; and Mr Craig Bildstien from Victoria. The four Australians made sure that Australia got a mention in many of the various topics that the seminar addressed during the time that we were assembled&mdash;over 2 1/2 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also delegates from Bangladesh, Barbados, Bermuda, Botswana, the British Virgin Islands, Federal Canada, the Cayman Islands, Ghana, the Isle of Man, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi, Federal Malaysia, the Malaysian State of Sabah, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Swaziland and Zambia. None of us had met before. That includes the four Australians. At the end of the 2 1/2 weeks very firm friendships had developed between the elected representatives of each of the countries. Because of that development in friendship the links between the countries themselves have been built upon, based on the solid roots that had been in existence prior to the delegation coming together for the seminar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many enjoyable times. When one looks back at these events one tends to reflect, firstly, on the enjoyable moments and perhaps to overlook at the beginning the work that was engaged in during the time the delegates were in assemblies. We did quite a deal of work, particularly when we were based in London. Generally, most of the work was done in the British Houses of Parliament at Westminster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were very well looked after by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association which arranged many excellent speakers and very many entertaining forums for the delegates who had come from diverse backgrounds to take part in the seminar. Unfortunately, as is the case with all these seminars, there was not enough time to debate and discuss fully all the matters that were raised in assemblies. Because we were staying at a hotel that was very close to Westminster we were able to continue many of the discussions, sometimes into the early hours of the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to say which was the most important topic, but I would like to comment about the last formal discussion that the seminar engaged in. That topic was the role of the UK in the Commonwealth. It followed that morning's discussion on the Commonwealth and world affairs. The role of the United Kingdom was particularly important. On this occasion the Rt Hon. Baroness Chalker of Wallasey, Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and Minister for Overseas Development in the British Parliament, led the debate. It flowed on from the earlier discussion on the Commonwealth and world affairs in which Tom Cox, a member of the Labour Party opposition in Great Britain, and Jim Lester, a Conservative Party member, drew a Commonwealth parliamentary perspective of recent world events. One item of particular interest in those topics for discussion was the emergence of South Africa in the world scene and very much into Commonwealth affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consensus of all delegates assembled was that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is a very useful organisation, and long may it reign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met with the Commonwealth Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Chief Emeka Anyaoku; and had some long discussions with the Deputy Secretary-General (Political), Sir Anthony Siaguru KBE. They were very worth while, not only for me but for all delegates. Only the delegates from New Zealand had travelled a further distance than the Australian delegates had. Again, there was not enough time for the dialogue to be fully explored with all the individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is not with me tonight. In any case, I do not want to go chapter and verse through all that happened during the 2 1/2 weeks of the seminar. I want to take up my full 10 minutes in recording some thanks. Thanks should go to the organisers of the seminar who worked tirelessly to ensure that all the needs of all the delegates were met, within the limitations of how those needs could be met. I would particularly mention Sir Ivan Lawrence QC MP, who is the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. They were our hosts. I expressed my personal appreciation to Sir Ivan for the amount of time he gave to the delegation, in meeting with us, attending some of the functions after hours, and then, at the conclusion of the events, again meeting with us and addressing us and answering some questions which from time to time may have appeared pretty silly and stupid to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the secretariat which did all the hard work in looking after us on a day-to-day basis. I thank the Secretary, Mr Peter Cobb; the Deputy Secretary, Mr Andrew Pearson; the Assistant Secretary, Mr Christopher Jones; and the Administrator, Mrs Elizabeth Callard. I want to put on record my personal appreciation of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the people who organised things for us in Oxford where we were for two nights and two very full days; and the people in Manchester also need recognition. I will not, because time is against me, record their names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking back now, two months later, the thing that I recall most clearly is the two days on the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is probably a misnomer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is. I pick up that point. It was one of the first countries to give women the vote. That was in 1881, which was even before South Australia gave women the vote. South Australia was the leading state here in that regard. It was certainly 40 years before women got the vote in mainland Britain. The Isle of Man is very forward thinking, not only because it gave the vote to women early in the piece. Because of its location in the middle of the Irish Sea&mdash;it is not part of Ireland&mdash;it is celtic in character. It has a native language. Manx is a derivative of one of the celtic languages.</PARA></TALK.START>
