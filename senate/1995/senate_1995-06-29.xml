<TITLE>Vietnamese Asylum Seekers</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the President and Members of the Senate, assembled in Parliament House of the Commonwealth of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate various concerns related to Vietnamese asylum seekers in South East Asia and Hong Kong camps. These are: Firstly, that there is strong evidence that their refugee status determination (screening) by the first asylum countries under the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) was flawed by widespread corruption and/or prejudice by screening and appeal panels, and procedural faults. Secondly, that the UN High Commission for Refugees is not seen to take active nor systematic steps to identify and review wrongly screened out refugees. Thirdly, all asylum seekers are now facing or will soon face forced repatriation against their will, amounting to refugee refoulement in the case of refugees among them. Fourthly, all asylum seekers have for some years now been deprived of basic needs by measures such as closing of secondary and primary schools in camps, cutting of essential medical facilities, and restricting communications with relatives outside the camps, which are seen as designed to coerce asylum seekers to repatriate against their will.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I present to the Senate the following petition, from 1,053 citizens, which is not in conformity with the standing orders as it is not in the correct form:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, the undersigned, urge the Federal Minister for Primary Industry to reconsider the Federal Government's decision to exclude Central and Northern Victoria from qualifying for exceptional circumstance provision for drought relief under the Rural Adjustment Scheme.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator TROETH</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I thank the Senate. I wish to highlight the problem that is presently being encountered by farmers affected by drought in central McEwen. Two areas in Victoria received assistance; unfortunately, the area of McEwen was not one of those. Farmers in the area of McEwen have been feeding out for the past 12 to 18 months: many have spent in excess of $40,000 on feed, the average cost to keep sheep alive is between $10 and $15 per head, and the majority of farmers have used up their cash reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the recent rain means that the drought has broken, it is now a green drought in that there is a veneer of green but no real growth of pasture. Farmers in this area cannot understand why some wheat areas qualify for special circumstance provision because they need assistance to harvest their crops, but cattle and sheep are not regarded as a similar harvest in the sense that assistance should be granted to keep those animals alive and in good condition until a cash return can be obtained from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representations have been made by the member for McEwen, Mr Cleeland, saying that the government followed the RASAC guidelines, but the petitioners would like the guidelines and recommendations to be published so that they can judge for themselves whether or not McEwen was treated fairly. Ultimately, the government can choose to accept or not accept the recommendations. The people who have signed this petition hope that the government would wish to consider McEwen in the list of areas to be looked at for exceptional circumstance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL LAND GRANT AND MANAGEMENT (JERVIS BAY TERRITORY) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill reflects the continuing commitment of this Government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people throughout Australia. The Bill is a result of a wide acknowledgment of the significance of Jervis Bay to the local Aboriginal people and their strong work as a community in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is modelled on the very successful and highly acclaimed Uluru National Park joint management arrangement. That arrangement recently won the prestigious award, the UNESCO Picasso Gold Medal, in recognition of the outstanding management and conservation of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park which has been achieved with the participation and support of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, once approved by Parliament, has the potential to provide opportunities for non-indigenous Australians visiting the internationally renowned Jervis Bay to learn a great deal about the vibrant indigenous culture that has cared for these lands and waters for so many generations, and will undoubtedly advance Australia's international standing through its demonstration of the Government's commitment to indigenous joint management of such heritage areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also represents a significant step in the reconciliation process by formalising the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community's willingness to participate in an arrangement to utilise their lands and waters in the National Park as a significant and properly planned cultural tourism destination. The bill embraces the progressive views of major environmental organisations in Australia that have responded to the concept of indigenous land management in such a positive way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, Mr President, I think it should also be pointed out that the grant of these areas and associated joint management proposals have received wide public support, particularly from the local region, as is evidenced by an editorial in the Illawarra Mercury when the Government first announced its intentions in October last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will enable title to such areas of the Jervis Bay National Park and the Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens that are of significance to the Aboriginals who are members of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community to be granted to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council, where it is deemed appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is a step in the implementation by the Commonwealth of recommendation 315 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which provides a comprehensive agenda for governments to address aboriginal aspirations for involvement in national parks including the negotiation of lease-back arrangements which enable title to land on which National Parks are situated to be transferred to Aboriginal owners, subject to the lease of the area to the relevant State or Commonwealth authority on payment of rent to the Aboriginal owners. The recommendation was endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is based on the models successfully applied to the Uluru and Kakadu national parks in the Northern Territory. Under the bill the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council will lease any land granted as a consequence of the amendments back to the Director of National Parks and Wildlife.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes complementary amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 (the NPWC Act) under which the Jervis Bay National Park and the Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens are currently proclaimed. The NPWC Act provides for the establishment of Boards as a means to allow the joint management, with Aboriginal people, of areas of Aboriginal land that are situated wholly or partly in prescribed parks or reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By amending the definition of `prescribed park or reserve' to include the Jervis Bay National Park and the Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens, the bill will enable the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories to establish a Board for those areas, if they are declared to be Aboriginal land and if agreement is reached with the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council. The Board would have a majority of Aboriginal representatives and would include amongst its responsibilities, overseeing development of a plan of management for the national park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the NPWC Act will change the definition of `traditional Aboriginal owners' to include the registered members of the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council and give the Council (and chairperson of the Council) the same status as have other Aboriginal councils in relation to relevant provisions of the Act, such as those concerning preparation of plans of management and the establishment and operation of Boards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be noted that public rights and enjoyment of the national park and botanic gardens will be preserved under the joint management arrangements that shall be made possible by the proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of an agreement between the Minister for Environment Sport and Territories and the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community Council, in relation to the amendment of the Aboriginal Land Grant (Jervis Bay Territory) Act 1986, it was agreed that the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 would be extended to apply to the Jervis Bay Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 extend the application of that Act to all Australia's Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would allow the Commonwealth Grants Commission to report on appropriate funding for works and services in Jervis Bay as well as requiring inquiries into the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island as recently recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories in its report entitled "Delivering the Goods".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will allow the Commonwealth Government to address one of its principal policy objectives for Australia's Territories which is to align conditions and standards with those of comparable communities in the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be limited financial implications arising from this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HAZARDOUS WASTE (REGULATION OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 to bring that act into closer conformity with Australia's obligations under international instruments relating to the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal act was passed at the time that the Basel Convention was negotiated. At that time the major concern regarding trade in hazardous waste related to hazardous waste sent to another country for what is termed final disposal, that is for incineration, landfilling or the like. As a result, the Australian enabling act regulates material which has been rejected as worthless or otherwise falls within the ordinary definition of waste. As such it generally does not cover material sent for recovery. In the years since the Convention was negotiated the emphasis in international debate has shifted to its coverage of materials which are traded for recovery operations; that is, for reclamation of metals or recovery of other useful materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as the trade in hazardous waste for final disposal led to an active process of transferring the environmental costs associated with the generation of hazardous waste from one country to another, and in particular from developed to developing countries, so the trade in hazardous waste for recovery operations can similarly lead to the transfer of environmental costs in an uncontrolled fashion. The Basel Convention was drafted to cover both kinds of processes, that is both final disposal and recovery operations, and both kinds of processes are included in the Convention definitions under the single term "disposal". The Australian act does not cover a wide range of hazardous wastes from which valuable materials are to be recovered; these hazardous wastes are not worthless or do not fall within the ordinary meaning of waste. The major purpose of amending the act is to remedy this discrepancy between our international obligations and our domestic legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Basel Convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and the rest of the world have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the Convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, Australia cannot participate in this trade unless it accepts these rules. The interpretation of the Convention as expressed in the principal act and with the amendments now put forward is in line with the views of other parties to the Convention. Without these amendments, Australia would continue to be out of step with other Parties in its capacity to give domestic effect to the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the primary intention of the bill, the object of the act is to be amended to make it clear that one of its major aims is to give domestic effect to the Basel Convention and other international instruments relating to trade in hazardous wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of hazardous waste now to be adopted is aligned with that in the Convention. This will ensure that in future Australia does not find itself in breach of the Convention by virtue of having adopted a definition which is at odds with the interpretation of the Convention followed by others. Nevertheless, the question of definition remains central to the operation of the act, and indeed definitional questions remain the subject of very active debate in Basel Convention meetings. In Australia, a high degree of concern has been expressed because of the uncertainty of the definitions in the Convention. The bill addresses these concerns through the establishment of a process to provide greater practical certainty regarding what is and is not a hazardous waste. The bill provides for the establishment of a Technical Group of scientific and technical experts who will advise the Minister on definitional questions. The advice of this group will be of great benefit in enabling the Minister to decide whether a material is considered to fall within the definition of hazardous waste and so is regulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will have the power to issue Evidentiary Certificates which will be prima facie evidence that a given material is or is not a hazardous waste; and by compiling a list of materials for which Evidentiary Certificates have been issued, the Minister will be able to provide greater certainty to those subject to regulation on what materials will be controlled and what will not. This means for example, that it will be possible to issue an Evidentiary Certificate stating that a material such as clean ferrous scrap is not a hazardous waste subject to the act and can be traded without any controls. At the same time, flexibility will be retained to respond to incremental progress in international discussions on what materials should and should not be controlled. As an example, recent international discussions suggest that the existence of internationally recognised product specifications will be influential in deciding what are and are not hazardous wastes. The Evidentiary Certificates will not be conclusive, but will be prima facie evidence; and the definitions in the act would remain as the final means of determining the definitional question. In practice, however, the advice of the Technical Group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues, and should satisfy the needs of those who are subject to regulation for a clear understanding of their obligations under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many who would prefer to replace the uncertain Basel definitions with Australia's own list or set of criteria. To follow that course, however, would inevitably lead to Australia once again being at odds with the Convention and the views of trading partners on what constitutes hazardous waste under the Convention. This would risk not only breach of our international obligations but could well lead to shipments acceptable under our definitions being rejected at foreign ports, to the embarrassment, cost and inconvenience of all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention itself recognises that the hazardous criteria it establishes are in need of further development. There is provision for the development of national tests which would provide greater precision in determining whether a waste is hazardous. That provision is included in the relevant Annex to the Convention, by reference to which the bill defines hazardous waste. Over time the Technical Group will advise on national tests to establish hazard on a more certain basis, taking account of international developments. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another key concept in the Convention now adopted into the act is the definition of "environmentally sound management". The Convention requires not only that an exporting country obtain prior informed consent from the country of import before allowing the transboundary movement to proceed, but also that the country of export require that the waste to be shipped is managed in an environmentally sound way in the country of import. The concept of environmentally sound management of hazardous waste is defined in the Convention as "taking all practicable steps" to ensure that the hazardous waste is managed to protect human health and the environment. The Technical Group will advise the Minister to assist in determination of what constitutes environmentally sound management and whether particular facilities or processes meet the definition. For that reason, it will include people with social and economic expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of environmentally sound management as set out in the Convention replaces the phrase in the principal act "dispose of safely". In the principal act "dispose of safely" is defined in terms of an outcome, that is hazardous waste is disposed of safely provided there is no damage to human health or environment. By contrast, "environmentally sound management" is defined by reference to a process, that is, "taking all practicable steps" to prevent damage to human health or the environment. In practice, pragmatic considerations are likely to prevail. Within the Basel Convention process detailed guidelines on what constitutes environmentally sound management have already been drafted, and these will provide the context for the Technical Group's advice to the Minister. Australia will put its efforts into ensuring that those guidelines are sound. Once again, the need to ensure that our legislation is fully in line with our international obligations is the overriding consideration in the changes set out in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Convention the general rule is that Parties must not trade in hazardous waste with non-Parties. An exception to this is provided for in Article 11, whereby Parties may enter into agreements or arrangements either with other Parties or with non-Parties. These agreements or arrangements can set out controls which are different from those prescribed by the Convention itself, provided those controls do not reduce the level of environment protection intended by the Convention. The only such agreement to which Australia is currently a party is the OECD Decision on Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste Destined for Recovery Operations (the OECD Decision), which regulates transboundary movement of hazardous wastes among OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides explicitly for regulations giving effect to such agreements and arrangements, and for those regulations to give domestic effect to rules different from those in the Convention. The materials covered by the agreements or arrangements may also differ to some extent from those covered by the Convention. Thus the OECD Decision covers some wastes which are not hazardous wastes under the Convention and trade in these must comply with the controls set out by the Decision; conversely, the Decision classifies some materials as non-hazardous waste (the OECD Green List) and these materials may be traded without a permit provided countries outside the OECD are not involved. The provisions are general and can be applied to any further Article 11 agreements or arrangements which Australia enters into.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures by which the Minister reaches a decision on whether or not a permit should be issued for a transboundary movement have been amended, once again to bring the act more closely into line with the Convention. Among the changes are those ensuring that the prior informed consent procedures established by the Convention are followed. Another amends the existing provision that the Minister have regard to the possibility of processing hazardous waste within Australia when considering an export application. This is in accordance with Article 4(2)(d) of the Convention which requires parties to "minimise the transboundary movement of hazardous waste consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of hazardous waste". The intent of this Article is met by requirements that disposal in Australia must be both efficient and environmentally sound. The intent is that a local disposal facility must be more than merely an experimental or test facility, and must operate on a commercial basis. There must be some cost effectiveness factor which is brought to bear when the Minister weighs up the pros and cons of local versus overseas disposal in deciding whether or not a permit should be issued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal act already provides that there must be appropriate insurance for shipments of hazardous waste before a permit is issued. A new provision in the bill allows the Minister to require bonds or guarantees in addition to, or instead of, insurance. This recognises that where there is contravention of a permit, for one reason or other an insurance policy may not be paid out, and a bond would allow the Commonwealth to ensure that there was some coverage in such a case. In other cases insurance may not be available, and a guarantee would provide the opportunity for a permit to be issued in such cases. The principal act allows the sum total of such arrangements (insurance, bonds, and guarantees) to be assessed when the Minister comes to a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other procedural amendments are aimed at ensuring that the administration of the act proceeds smoothly and efficiently, and that all Convention requirements are met. Because the Convention itself contains detailed rules, it has not been possible to simplify the administrative system beyond a certain point. That is why both the principal act and the amending bill are complex. Where possible and appropriate, provision is made for the making of regulations to set out requirements under the act, in order to ensure that its administration will be flexible and responsive to the needs of industry. A detailed set of administrative procedures is being developed in consultation with interested parties, including industry, and will be complete by the time the amendments are ready to come into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act also addresses a number of aspects of the Convention which were not picked up in the original drafting process. One of the most important of these is the issue of transit permits, that is for Australian consent (or its denial) to the transiting of waste from another country on its way to a third country for disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also explicit provision for more than one shipment of the same hazardous waste to be covered by a single permit. The Convention allows such a procedure up to a maximum of 12 months, provided that certain conditions are met and that is now reflected in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current system for recovery of the Government's administrative costs in respect of issuing permits is unnecessarily inflexible. The bill provides for fees to be set in regulations on the basis of administrative costs of each type of permit. The Minister has discretion to reduce fees where appropriate. The fee level may not be above the fee currently prescribed in the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties under the act have been increased in order to provide a deterrent to illegal traffic. Prevention of illegal traffic is specifically required by the Convention, and the value of some of the transactions involved requires that penalties be raised to ensure that companies are deterred from failing to comply with the act's requirements. A new provision is that executive officers of companies will be personally liable for contraventions by companies, with the onus of proof resting with the Commonwealth&mdash;that is, liability will not be automatic. Liability for executive officers of companies is an important step in ensuring compliance with the act, as it would be difficult for other compliance measures to be effective&mdash;for example, identification of hazardous wastes at the Customs barrier when materials leave the country would often be difficult given that hazardous waste cannot readily be distinguished from a variety of other materials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third party standing under the principal act is already very broad with respect to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Standing under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 has been extended by providing standing for organisations and associations which have matters which relate to the decision under the act as part of their object or purpose. This will provide further legislative clarity to the standing rules for the purposes of the ADJR act and is an extension of the standing rules which have already been recognised in recent cases under other similar legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has been the subject of extensive consultations with a variety of groups both inside and outside Government. In particular, detailed consultations have been held with a Policy Reference Group made up of representatives of industry, environment groups, development and co-operation groups, and unions. State and Territory Governments have also been consulted. An exposure draft of the bill was provided to members of the Reference Group and to States and Territories, and comments have been taken into account in finalising the bill. In the course of the consultations, an issue which has stimulated more discussion than any other is Decision II/12, taken at the Second Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention in March 1994. This decision, known as the Ban Decision, was in favour of an immediate ban on the export of hazardous waste for final disposal from OECD to non-OECD countries; and phasing out by the end of 1997 and banning from that date the export of hazardous waste for recovery operations from OECD to non-OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is yet to decide its position with respect to the Ban Decision. There are proposals on the table internationally for the Ban Decision to be incorporated into the Basel Convention as an amendment, and those proposals will be considered by the Third Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in September 1995. It has been Australian Government policy for some time, however, that the export of wastes for final disposal to developing countries is not acceptable practice and that policy is now reflected in the bill. Indeed the bill extends that policy by limiting exports for final disposal to any country to exceptional circumstances, such as where there is a direct risk to human health or environment if the waste remains in Australia, or if the wastes are being exported for research or testing. It remains firm Government policy not to export hazardous waste for final disposal to developing countries. Each permit issued under this provision of the amended act will be specified in the regulations to ensure that the application of the concept of "exceptional circumstances" is transparent and subject to scrutiny by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of the definition of hazardous waste from that in the principal act to that in the Convention will inevitably result in regulation of a far wider range of hazardous wastes than at present. Studies which have been carried out recently into the range of wastes covered by the Basel Convention and Australia's trade in them suggests that total trade may be somewhere between $100 million and $200 million each year. The vast majority of this takes place with OECD countries, and is therefore subject to the less rigid controls set out by the OECD Decision. The kinds of materials in which we trade with developing countries of our region include spent lead acid batteries, metal-bearing wastes such as sludges, slags and drosses and a miscellaneous range of wastes variously containing metals such as lead or arsenic. These are the kinds of materials which will be regulated under the amended act. Suggestions that clean ferrous and most clean non-ferrous scrap metal will be caught up under the Convention are mistaken. The only significant material of this kind which, it appears, must be regulated under the Convention is lead scrap, and even that may be traded without a permit with OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, the amended act will not cover trade in products, mineral ores and concentrates, processed minerals and metals or uncontaminated waste paper or textiles. The distinction between wastes on the one hand, and non-wastes on the other, especially where co-products, intermediates and by-products are concerned, will be subject to consideration and advice by the Technical Group. The Technical Group will also be giving priority to assisting the Minister in determining which of the OECD green listed materials are clearly inside the scope of the act (expected to be a small number) and which are clearly outside it, with a view to the Minister's reflecting this in Evidentiary Certificates. Consultations with all interested parties will continue as regulations and supporting administrative arrangements are developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bilateral discussions between Australia and our developing-country trading partners make it clear that they wish and expect Australia to abide by the rules to which so many of the countries of the world have agreed. A continued failure to do so may lead to retaliatory reaction by these countries, which could threaten trade far more seriously than the controls required by the Convention and now established by this bill. It is time for Australia to give effect to the obligations it has taken upon itself, just as the vast majority of its trading partners have done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRANSPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my second reading speech introducing the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, I said that the two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and Airservices Australia (AA), together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI), will constitute a tri-partite structure, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BASI has the independent role of investigating accidents and incidents (which will include any occurrences involving CASA and AA) and promoting safety by identifying deficiencies in the aviation system. This Bill amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 to strengthen BASI's capacity to conduct more detailed, systemic investigations and analysis and to ensure, as far as practicable, air safety investigations in Australia conform to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards as set out in Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reflect the fact that BASI operates independently within the Department of Transport the amendments vest the power to conduct investigations in the Director of Air Safety Investigation. The Director has the normal powers of delegation. The amendments provide that upon completion of an investigation the Secretary of the Department may publish any information in an investigation report he or she considers desirable to promote aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments identify those persons (defined as "responsible persons") who are required to report accidents, serious incidents and incidents to the Director. These are essentially persons who have some involvement in the operation of an aircraft. Officers of CASA and AA who become aware of an accident, serious incident or incident are also required to report to the Director.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments provide that the purpose of an investigation is to prevent the occurrence of other accidents, serious incidents and incidents and not to assign blame or liability. This reflects the statement of the objective of an investigation in Annex 13 of the Chicago Convention. Many of the operative provisions of the amendments pick up definitions and standards from Annex 13.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Director has the power to require persons to answer questions and produce documents, aircraft components or other things. However, the amendments provide that the answer, to a question or the production of documents or aircraft components cannot be used in evidence against the person in criminal proceedings. The amendments make clear that BASI investigators have a limited right to enter onto an accident site to secure wreckage and for the purposes of investigation. BASI investigators are also authorised to exercise investigation powers on private property if a Magistrate issues a warrant. These powers of entry are tied to the production of formal identification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also provide limited protection from disclosure for those classes of records (defined as "air safety records") that ICAO has identified as requiring protection for air safety investigation purposes. These records are not to be disclosed in civil proceedings unless a court determines that it is in the interests of justice to order disclosure having regard to the adverse domestic and international impact such action may have on that or any future investigations. This essentially mirrors the test contained in Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention and is consistent with the practice adopted in other jurisdictions such as Canada, the UK and the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that by enhancing BASI's powers of investigation these amendments will significantly assist in ensuring the integrity and safety of Australia's civil aviation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 (the SRC Act) by removing the section which establishes the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority (the Authority) as a separate statutory authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Authority will no longer be a legal entity separate from the Commonwealth, it is inappropriate that money be appropriated to it. Consequently, the finance provisions of the SRC Act are also being repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority will be a separate budget-funded agency, similar to the International Air Services Commission, within the Department of Transport. As indicated in the Second Reading Speech when the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill was introduced in 1992, the Authority has been serviced by the Department of Transport. That arrangement will continue. The amendments will have no effect on Commonwealth revenue or expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the short time available I have had relevant inquiries made of those Departments which may have in their possession documents caught by the motion moved by Senator Vanstone. As a result of those inquiries, I table certain documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the documents caught by this motion I have not tabled, on the basis that they are subject to legal professional privilege or public interest immunity or both. The documents which are caught by the motion which I have not tabled include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">requests by the Attorney-General for advice from his Department;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">correspondence between solicitors in relation to the contemplated litigation subsequent to the Cabinet decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These documents clearly fall within the accepted boundaries of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity. The Senate has traditionally recognised such claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further the issues raised by Dr Lawrence's challenge will, I understand, be shortly before the courts. It would also be inappropriate for these documents to be publicly disclosed at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However I do make the following comments. The funding of Dr Lawrence by the Commonwealth is fully justified, and the processes whereby that funding was determined was wholly appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be remembered, however, that it was the Court Government of Western Australia which established this Royal Commission and it is the Court Government which should bear the responsibility for its cost, including the costs of Dr Lawrence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that responsibility is not met then the Commonwealth has a duty to ensure that Dr Lawrence is appropriately represented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process which the Government has adopted, which is designed to ensure that Dr Lawrence is not bankrupted by defending herself in this blatantly political attack on her fitness to be a Commonwealth Minister, is neither unusual nor without precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hon. Nick Young MP received legal funding assistance from the Commonwealth in relation to the Hope Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Groom Liberal Government agreed to meet the legal expenses of former Premier Gray in relation to his appearance before the Rouse Bribery Royal Commission. This included his Supreme Court challenge to the Royal Commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fahey Coalition Government agreed to meet the costs of former Premier Nick Greiner's appearance before the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the subsequent Supreme Court challenge by Mr Greiner against the finding that he was corrupt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was also the Fahey Government's decision to fund the current Leader of the Opposition, Peter Collins', appearance before the Independent Commission Against Corruption in relation to the decision of the NSW Department of Health not to pursue a costs order made against Mr Collins as a result of a failed private defamation action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's State colleagues thought that the provision of legal assistance was appropriate in cases where corruption or maladministration was being alleged. Yet they now have the hypocrisy to claim that the Government should not fund Dr Lawrence's legal costs when no such allegation is before the WA Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is right and proper in these circumstances that Cabinet determine whether a Minister is entitled to legal assistance on a case by case basis. This process has been followed in relation to Dr Lawrence. The Cabinet considered the issues, took its own legal advice, and decided to provide assistance. Dr Lawrence quite properly excluded herself from those deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be totally inappropriate for the Government's legal advice or the terms of the Cabinet deliberations to now be disclosed. We all know the track record of Liberals from South Australia in getting hold of documents to be used in legal proceedings involving the Commonwealth and giving it to the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It remains patently clear that the decision to offer legal funding to Dr Lawrence was wholly justified. The sole purpose of the Royal Commission is to impugn Dr Lawrence in her capacity as a Commonwealth Minister. If Dr Lawrence were not a Commonwealth minister there would be no Royal Commission. In these circumstances it is entirely appropriate for the Commonwealth Government to provide Dr Lawrence with assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the establishment of the Royal Commission offends one of the most basic principles of parliamentary democracy. The Bill of Rights of 1688 states that the proceedings of Parliament are not to be questioned in any place out of Parliament. This provision is embodied in section 16 of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Privileges Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission has been specifically established to inquire into and question proceedings of parliament, and as such it is a direct attack by the executive on notions of Parliamentary privilege. As such, the establishment of this Royal Commission should be of concern to all Australian Parliaments and indeed all Australian Parliamentarians, including the Senators in this Chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the equivalent of the Government establishing a Royal Commission, with coercive powers, into why this motion has been moved.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives me pleasure today to table on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the results of the Committee's review of 1992-93 audit reports titled: Report 337&mdash;A Focus On Accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report 337 reviews 37 reports of the Auditor-General which were tabled in the financial year 1992-93, and is prepared in accordance with section 8(1)(ab) of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, requiring the Committee to examine all reports of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reviewing these reports the Committee has not canvassed in detail all of the issues raised by the Auditor-General, but instead has focused on the key recommendations in his reports. The Committee's review has shown that in the vast majority of cases, agencies have responded positively and promptly to the Auditor-General's recommendations. In some cases, however, it is clear that agencies have disagreed with the recommendations, or have not taken appropriate or effective remedial action. It is these cases which are commented upon in Report 337.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report 337 contains 15 recommendations for further action by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendations address various matters, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need for the Department of Employment, Education and Training to take further steps to reduce the levels of debt associated with the AUSTUDY program, which amounted to $60.3m in early 1993-94;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need for the Health Insurance Commission to continue to develop and implement strategies aimed at identifying and discouraging Medicare fraud and over-servicing, which have the potential to be a significant drain on Commonwealth resources; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need for the Joint Coal Board and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to clarify the method of valuing the Coal Board's future liability for workers' compensation insurance, which is in the order of $225m</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also made a series of recommendations about the management by the Department of Defence of the new submarine project. This project was the subject of critical comment by the Auditor-General in Audit Report No. 22, 1992-93, Efficiency Audit, Department of Defence, New Submarine Project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has taken a forward looking approach in commenting on the submarine project. We have not reviewed in detail the nature of the contract for the construction of the submarines, nor have we commented on the rather colourful debates that took place around the time the audit report was tabled. Instead we have focused on some of the risks facing the project and have considered whether steps can be taken to improve the management of these risks for the remainder of the submarine project and for future defence projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking this approach the Committee acknowledges that the Department of Defence has managed many of the risks successfully. For example, evidence to date indicates that the Project Office has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the submarine construction and performance standards will be satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there are areas where project management improvements can be made. Some of the audit findings in relation to financial and scheduling risks, for example, warrant close attention by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has for example, noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that a considerable proportion of the contract price has been paid before some of the most significant project risks have been overcome;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that there is sufficient reason to be concerned about the financial guarantees available to the Commonwealth; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that the Commonwealth appears to be bearing a disproportionate amount of the financial risk associated with the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main theme running through the Committee's consideration of the submarine project is the need for the Department of Defence to exercise more commercially astute management of major acquisitions projects, particularly in relation to the timing of cash payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has made what I believe are a series of constructive recommendations which, if implemented, will help ensure that the submarine project and future Defence projects of similar size are managed in an effective and cost-efficient manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Report 337 is confirmation that the Public Accounts Committee is committed to ensuring that the reports of the Auditor-General receive close parliamentary attention. By reviewing each audit report that is tabled the Parliament signals to government agencies that the process of accountability and scrutiny is continuous and proceeds beyond the tabling of an audit report.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes measures announced in the Treasurer's Superannuation Policy statement of 28 June 1994. In that statement the Treasurer outlined several major initiatives to enhance the Government's retirement incomes policy and to alleviate the small amounts problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the measures in the Bill, such as the employee share scheme provisions, are new and largely self-contained. These have been drafted in the new tax law improvement style. Other measures in the Bill either amend existing provisions of the law or inter-relate with concepts already contained in other parts of the law (for example, the late lodgment penalty and interest provisions). For these reasons it has not been possible to fully adopt the new drafting style as this would entail changes to a much broader range of provisions. The tax law improvement project will be redrafting the tax law over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employee share schemes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to provide a new income tax regime for the taxation of employee share schemes. The new regime will generally apply from 6pm in the ACT (and the equivalent time elsewhere) on 28 March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional arrangements will apply so that in certain circumstances the existing provisions of the income tax law will continue to apply to shares or rights to shares acquired after the date of commencement of the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is making these changes to reduce the exploitation of the existing legislation and to ensure that the tax concessions that are available under the new arrangements are directed at share schemes which encourage employees to own shares in the company in which they are employed or a holding company of the employer. The measures will increase the taxation benefits available to employees under these schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount to be included in a taxpayer's assessable income in respect of the shares and rights acquired will be the difference between the value of the share or right and any amount paid by the taxpayer to acquire the share or right. Generally, the amount is to be included in assessable income in the year that the share or right is acquired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in certain circumstances a deferral of taxation of up to 5 years without any upper limit on amount will be available. Conditions have to be satisfied before a share or right qualifies for the deferral concession. The share or right must be acquired under an employee share scheme. At the time the share or right is acquired, or at an earlier time, each permanent employee should have been entitled to acquire shares or rights of the employer or holding company of the employer. The shares or rights should be ordinary shares or rights of the employer or holding company. The employee should also not hold more than 5% of shares or voting rights of the employer company or holding company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An exemption concession will apply for certain shares or rights that are issued to employees under a scheme operated on a non-discriminatory basis. The employee can elect that the discount received be included in his or her assessable income in the income year in which the shares or rights are acquired. Where this election is made, benefits up to a limit of $500 for an income year will be exempt from tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the exemption concession applies, the provider of the benefit will be entitled to a tax deduction for up to $500 of benefits provided to each employee. This deduction will apply if the deduction is not allowable under the other provisions of the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the capital gains provisions and the fringe benefits tax law to ensure that there is no double taxation of share or right benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of these measures is such that a reliable estimate of the revenue impact cannot be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capital gains tax&mdash;roll-over relief for merging superannuation funds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the capital gains tax (CGT) provisions to allow certain superannuation funds which merge to defer any CGT gains or losses that would be realised at the time of the merger on the assets transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Government remains of the view that CGT should, in general, be payable on assets realised when entities merge, it considers that special circumstances exist that justify this concession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Government recognises that the new member protection rules may put greater pressure on superannuation funds to merge to improve their economies of operation. It also realises that current CGT rules may affect the short term liquidity of such superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This temporary relief will improve the efficiency and performance of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will apply to superannuation funds that merge on or after 1 July 1994 and before 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notional cost to the revenue from the proposal is estimated to be $50 million for each of the 3 years of its operation. The actual cost to the revenue will be less because many funds would not merge if roll-over relief was not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation guarantee&mdash;jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill clarifies the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC). It is generally accepted that the operation of the superannuation guarantee legislation has not affected the jurisdiction, powers, or functions of the AIRC. However, there is no express statement in the superannuation guarantee legislation or the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason, and because there has been doubt expressed in some quarters concerning the power of the AIRC to continue to arbitrate on superannuation, the amendment makes it clear that the superannuation guarantee legislation does not alter in any way the substantive jurisdiction, functions and powers of the AIRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will apply from the commencement of the superannuation guarantee law on 1 July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment has no impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation guarantee&mdash;flat dollar contributions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the superannuation guarantee law to ensure that the percentage level of superannuation support actually provided for an employee for flat dollar contributions is calculated based on actual contributions, rather than the amount specified in the award. The current provision causes problems where contributions differ from the award amount. The effect of the amendment will be to make it easier for some employers to satisfy their superannuation guarantee requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will take effect from 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no cost to the revenue from the change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation guarantee&mdash;local government councillors</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes to generally exempt from the superannuation guarantee law the payments received by local government councillors in the course of their duties. The payments will not be regarded as salary and wages for superannuation guarantee purposes, enabling councillors to claim deductions under the income tax legislation for any personal superannuation contributions. The exemption will not apply to payments from certain local government bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local government councillors will retain their status as employees for the purposes of the superannuation industry supervisory legislation to prevent some funds which have councillors as members from being treated as public offer funds which entails higher compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will apply from 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cost to the revenue in the 1994-95 and subsequent years will be less than $500 000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation&mdash;various amendments to the income tax law</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the Security in Retirement statement of 30 June 1992 the Government has introduced a number of changes to the income tax law to encourage superannuation pensions and annuities and to ensure that superannuation moneys are kept within the superannuation system until withdrawal. This Bill makes some minor adjustments to some of these changes to clarify their operation and further ease administrative requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Bill changes the income tax law to ensure that superannuation pension and roll-over annuity recipients who started receiving a pension or annuity before 1 July 1994 will be able to change providers without losing tax concessions. This change will allow pensioners and annuitants to move their investment without being disadvantaged by a different tax treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also amends the income tax law to ensure that tax concessions for employer superannuation contributions are restricted to superannuation funds established primarily for the benefit of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are not expected to have any significant impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation&mdash;miscellaneous amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes a small number of miscellaneous amendments to superannuation law administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two main amendments allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to undertake statistical surveys of the superannuation industry and change the method of collection of the superannuation supervisory levy. As a result, the manner in which the late payment penalty for the levy is calculated is also changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes some other, more technical, amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No overall impact on revenue is expected to result from these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State and Territory bodies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments in the Bill will create broad new exemptions from income tax and sales tax for certain State and Territory bodies. These amendments arise from an agreement reached at the 1994 Premiers' Conference, which aims to promote efficiency and competitive neutrality in markets in which State and Territory trading enterprises operate. One aspect of this is removing the tax advantage enjoyed by State and Territory trading enterprises over private businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was agreed that the tax advantage could be eliminated if the States and Territories imposed tax equivalent regimes on their trading enterprises. A tax equivalent regime is basically equivalent to Commonwealth income tax and sales tax in its principles and the rates imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before tax equivalent regimes are introduced, the States and Territories need to be certain that their trading enterprises will be exempt from Commonwealth income tax and sales tax. Certain State and Territory bodies will therefore be made clearly exempt. Some bodies will be specifically excluded from the exemption, including bodies prescribed by regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will not change the tax status of many of these bodies. For the 1994-95 year, the bodies which were taxable at the time of the 1994 Premiers' Conference will remain taxable. These bodies will in most cases become exempt from 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are expected to be revenue neutral.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late lodgment penalty</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill introduces a new penalty regime for late lodgment of income tax returns. The penalties will apply to 1994-95 and later year returns where the due date for lodgment occurs after the later of 30 June 1995 or 60 days after the date of Royal Assent of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies, superannuation funds and certain trusts will be liable for a flat rate penalty of $25 for each week that a return remains outstanding, up to a maximum of $500.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All other taxpayers who are late in lodging an income tax return will be liable for additional tax of 8% per annum on the amount of net tax payable for the year of income. In addition they will also be liable for interest on the net tax payable at the same rate that applies to underpayments and late payments of income tax. That interest rate is currently 10.8% per annum. The additional tax and the interest will be calculated from the due date for lodgment until the return is lodged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reliable estimate of the impact on the revenue cannot be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Refunds of tax file number amounts deducted in error</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the income tax law in a number of respects to ease compliance costs encountered by investment bodies when they are required to refund tax incorrectly deducted by them because of a mistake concerning an investor's tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One amendment limits the refunds to be made by investment bodies to requests for refunds received on or before 15 July following the year of income in which the incorrect deduction of tax file number amounts occurred. This will reduce investment body tax compliance costs associated with refunds that they are presently required to make in respect of amounts deducted in earlier years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any incorrectly deducted amounts not refunded by the investment body within the 15 July time frame would normally be allowed as a credit to the investor upon assessment of the investor's tax return for the relevant income year. However, where it is not reasonably appropriate for an investor to wait until an assessment has issued, the Commissioner of Taxation will be required to make refunds directly to an investor. This will ensure that an avenue for a refund is always available to an investor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment will provide for investment bodies to choose to offset any amounts that they refund against other amounts they deduct during the same year. This will also reduce compliance costs for investment bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will have no impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensions, allowances and benefits</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the mature age partner allowance was introduced, it was exempted from income tax. This is inconsistent with the treatment of the mature age allowance which is taxable. The Bill ensures that, as from 1 July 1995, the mature age partner allowance will be taxable. Recipients of the allowance will generally be eligible for the pensioner rebate which will offset the tax on the allowance, subject to any other income received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of this measure is a negligible gain to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments of tax provisions related to social welfare matters which have no impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales tax&mdash;new credit ground for unregistered exemption users</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing sales tax law an assessable dealing is taxable unless an exemption applies. An exemption applies when a quotation is made or the goods in question are always exempt goods. The law requires that a quote for a dealing be made at or before the time of the dealing for it to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person does not quote for a taxable dealing, then the dealing is taxable. A credit ground currently exists to enable a registered person to obtain a credit of tax paid on a dealing for which they had borne tax even though they were entitled to quote a registration number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to insert a similar credit ground to enable unregistered persons to obtain a credit of tax paid on a dealing for which they had borne tax even though they were entitled to quote an exemption declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this amendment on the revenue will be negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales tax&mdash;exemption for UHF transmitters</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes a limited extension to the operation of an earlier exemption from sales tax, for certain UHF transmitters, for use in commercial television broadcasting to cover the period 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new exemption will apply to transmitters for use in connection with the equalisation program which aims to provide services in regional areas comparable to those in capital cities. The Government considers that the extension is appropriate because the equalisation program is not yet completed in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total cost to the revenue for the period of the exemption is likely to be about $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minor amendments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments which have no impact on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting of the spring sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I have great pleasure in speaking to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee on Austudy. The Senate committee's inquiry into Austudy was prompted by a 1993-94 report of the Commonwealth Ombudsman which revealed many difficulties with the Austudy scheme and its administration. The main difficulties were: delays and errors in the processing of applications; delays in the determination of eligibility; provision of incorrect and ambiguous advice, exacerbated by lack of written records and oral advice; and inconsistencies between DEET and DSS with respect to various income support eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy has been the focus of several reports and reviews over the last few years, and the committee was concerned that the apparent level of dissatisfaction with the scheme had not been diminished. As well, new initiatives, such as the supplementary loans scheme by which students can trade in part of their Austudy grant for a loan twice the amount, had experienced a mixed reception in the student community. Student indebtedness was raised in many quarters as we carried out our inquiry. Publicity has also been given to the findings of a research project which suggest that the student assistance scheme was being manipulated by relatively wealthy families who have arranged their income and assets so that their children might be deemed to be eligible for Austudy support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in this somewhat clouded environment that the Senate committee sought to test the credibility of some of these claims and to examine possible changes to Austudy which might benefit all parties. The issues which emerged most forcefully during these hearings related to eligibility criteria for and consistency between Austudy and DSS income support arrangements, student debt and debt recovery procedures, and the quality of advice and support given to Austudy applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There currently exists between DEET and Department of Social Security offices a joint working party which examines issues related to the overlap and eligibility criteria when it comes to transition between Austudy and jobsearch and vice versa. The committee has identified a number of areas which this committee should investigate further. These include examining the agencies' statistics with a view to determining the extent of the flow of students from Austudy to DSS benefits and the circumstances under which such a transfer occurs. We simply do not know the degree to which people are opting out of full-time study and Austudy to move to part-time study on jobsearch because of the perceived additional benefits that they gain with the latter scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are inconsistencies between DEET and DSS in relation to the definition of `full-time' and `part-time' study which need to be resolved. We want DEET and DSS working groups to identify those policy areas which create blocks to the simple transition of eligible students between income support schemes and to prepare advice aimed at rectifying these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major problem also exists with incorrect or misunderstood advice being given to applicants, especially by staff in CES offices, who are not trained properly to deal with the complexities of Austudy. Over 180,000 new debts were due in the Austudy default system in 1993-94, and many of these stemmed from poor advice to students, so we have recommended that the training in Austudy for CES officers be substantially upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Student assistance centres must be funded to provide to all CES officers outreach training services, including training in the use of the new STEPS computer system, which is supposed to make Austudy applications and processing significantly less error prone. Such training should be accessible by DSS officers on request. As an interim measure, we have recommended that CES officers use special `recording of advice' forms to keep track of their contacts for Austudy applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also recommended that DEET, in consultation with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the relevant student advisory networks, develop a proposal for the training and support of university student welfare officers as on-campus Austudy advisers. To help with the problem of students not advising DEET of changes in their enrolment status and thereby incurring overpayment debts which have to be repaid later, we want DEET and the AVCC to jointly develop a mechanism for the enhancement of advice to student assistance centres concerning enrolment variations of students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students have been encouraged to take up the Austudy supplementary loans, but there is some resistance to trading in grants for loans of twice the size which have to be paid back after graduation. Already, the average loan is nearly $5,000 per loan, and the average level of student indebtedness is growing sharply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recommended that DEET be more detailed in its promotional material so that students are well aware of what they are letting themselves in for and what the debt recovery mechanisms are. We have also recommended that the National Union of Students do some work in providing consumer advice for students about these loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debt recovery is a big issue for students. DEET can currently recover debts by withholding up to 30 per cent of ongoing student payments. We argue that this should be reduced to no more than 14 per cent to bring it into line with other government debt recovery practices. There is a whole host of other anomalies, as I have said, which need to be sorted out if Austudy is to work satisfactorily in an environment where many other variations of income support apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studying today is a very expensive business with photocopying, rapidly out-of-date textbooks, computers and software purchases and so on. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has made it clear that Austudy is a targeted income support mechanism, which assumes that students will supplement their income with part-time work and so on. But that work is getting harder to get and, for many students, Austudy is their only form of income. It is extremely hard to live on Austudy even if one is on the highest level of benefit, which only a small proportion of students are receiving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the move to mass tertiary education, demands for increased expenditure on Austudy have naturally emerged. In trying to tighten up the system to ensure that the limited amount of money gets distributed to those students most in need, Austudy risks being not a lot of use to many students. The complexities of the scheme are compounding the situation and perhaps the government needs to take a long, hard look at the way in which it goes about student support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe our report will go some way towards improving Austudy as it exists at the moment, but that is not to say that at some point not too far down the track we may have to revise completely the way that we support students in an equitable and needs-based way. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee travelled extensively and heard from a broad range of Australians who were affected by Austudy. We found there to be great consistency in the evidence presented to us by students from different circumstances and by parents of students who are trying to assist their children in their pursuit of further education. There was a consistency of evidence from university administrations, TAFE administrations and school administrations, as well as from community groups and specialist commentators. The consistency was along the lines that the system as it is is not adequate in being able to deliver equitable support for further study for Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular matter which I pursued during the inquiry involved asking a great number of the witnesses in different places the question, `What is a student, how do we define a student in Australia, and what support should be offered to a person engaging in study?' I found it very interesting that, as a society, we are still grappling with our definition of a student. The Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and tertiary institutions all define full-time students or part-time students in different ways and this is where a lot of the problem has occurred. A person may believe that he is studying full time and in accordance with the guidelines of the institution at which he is studying, but he can be confronted by a government department which says, `You are not, and therefore we can only pay you a certain amount of money' or `We can only recognise a certain aspect of your studies'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That confuses the person and, perhaps, disadvantages him. Senator Tierney mentioned inconsistencies and I know that this is what he had in mind. There are inconsistencies in interpretation between departments and between tertiary institutions. I am pleased to endorse the recommendation of the committee that those inconsistencies ought to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was able to determine that people who engage in studies were attempting to improve their qualification skills: in other words, their contribution to the nation as a whole. These people had a feeling of not being supported in a full sense by the community. This is an intangibility which is a little difficult to nail down, but it is a feeling which permeated the hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I persisted in asking the witnesses how they felt students should be supported the answers, although varied, were consistent in that they believed that the present support was not full and was not an expression of community support, but was rather convoluted, difficult, inconsistent and begrudging. Young people who were engaged in the development of their skills for the benefit of the nation as well as themselves felt as if they did not have the full support of the nation. This is a poor state of affairs and one which I am sure nobody in this chamber would wish to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended an increase in the flexibility and capacity of DEET to recognise the human situations in which people find themselves when seeking support of the nation. The committee recommended that DEET act accordingly to provide support to our young people who are seeking to further their qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee had some difficulty in addressing some of the myths or suggestions that the system is being rorted by those who tailor their taxable incomes to qualify for Austudy. Accusations of this nature are abundant but the committee found it difficult to obtain hard evidence demonstrating how incomes were being tailored to suit applications for Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee determined that reliance on taxable income as a measure to determine who should and should not receive Austudy is not appropriate. Whilst that reliance exists there is the possibility that people will tailor their taxable incomes to enable them to qualify for the assistance of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee determined that there should be a more sophisticated method. The committee determined that if it is to be a targeted system rather than a universal system of support the targeting device should be more sophisticated and that it ought to be a little smarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We also wrestled with the definition of what is an independent person. We found that that definition was not as sophisticated as it could or should be. The committee was at pains to ensure that such questions were dealt with in a very comprehensive manner, perhaps even more comprehensive than they had been in the establishment of this very complicated and bureaucratically driven scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the demonstration of how complicated and inefficient it is can be illustrated by what the chairman said a few minutes ago&mdash;that if 186,000 new debts could be incurred in the period 1993-94 by Austudy recipients, something must be wrong. Either the system of advice by recipients to the bureaucracy is not efficient enough or the way that such advice is processed is not efficient enough. Either way, the system which enables such a huge number of new debts to be incurred is one which should withstand further investigation. I think the committee treated this matter seriously, it was comprehensive and it was most enlightening to those involved. I too commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add a few words to this debate. I particularly note that there are a number of recommendations within the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee that go to bringing into alignment or looking at a closer relationship with respect to Austudy and payments paid through the social security system. It is apparent to the committee that there are a variety of interpretations abroad as to what Austudy actually is. This, in turn, has led to a variety of expectations about the financial dimensions of Austudy and the range of additional benefits or concessions which should apply to those who receive it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we have made a number of recommendations&mdash;for instance, recommendation 1, where we recommend that the age of eligibility for Austudy and JSA rates at 21 be brought into line&mdash;it is nevertheless important for us to keep in mind that we are dealing with two quite distinct concepts. One is the provision of assistance to students who are engaged in full-time study and the other is the responsibility of society to provide income support to persons who may be unemployed, who may be sole parents or who may fit into a whole range of other categories where the social security system provides assistance. I have stressed throughout our deliberations that we need to bear that distinction in mind. There were quite a number of submissions from students and other groups who argued that there should be parity in respect of, for instance, Austudy and the jobsearch allowance in all regards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be remembered that we in this country recognise the need to support students, both financially and by providing a vast education infrastructure and resources&mdash;be it teachers, books, libraries, laboratories and so on&mdash;because education is a primary objective of our country in terms of maintaining its development. Austudy students do not get it easy. Anyone who has been a student knows that. As I said, I think we will run into trouble if we focus too heavily on trying to make Austudy and the jobsearch allowance virtually indistinguishable. Arguments were put to us that the age of independence, whereby Austudy could be available to students, should be at the same age as the jobsearch allowance&mdash;that is, 18 years of age. We have not accepted that because it would clearly skew badly the income support resources across the range of young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one was to take this issue further, one would probably come to the conclusion that the only way to provide a simple arrangement across the board would be to develop some kind of guaranteed minimum income policy for Australia as a whole. That of course is to look way beyond Austudy to a whole new income support ball game, something that our committee was conscious not to get too far into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather, what we have tried to do in our report, as Senator Tierney and Senator Bell have stated, is to identify the main shortcomings in the way that Austudy operates at the moment, and to look also at the way in which other forms of income support payment are made&mdash;and I particularly mention the jobsearch allowance. The committee also wanted to look at alternative ways of dealing with some of the problems that were brought to our attention and to try, as far as possible, to get a better interface between Austudy payments and Austudy procedures on the one hand, and DSS procedures on the other. </PARA>
<PARA>For instance, our attention was brought to the constant difficulties that students may come across in moving into an education system, moving out of that system and seeking to get into the job market; and the issues that arise when they earn income during the year whilst they are also studying. We are dealing with many hundreds of thousands of students and there are many thousands of different situations that can arise that have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we asked our witnesses about the major features of Austudy, whilst it was certainly pointed out to us that there were a range of procedural difficulties and administrative problems&mdash;there were also submissions to us about the level of payments and so on&mdash;it was, nevertheless, agreed fairly widely that it was at the margins of the scheme that the problems really emerged. It was at the margins where the anomalies showed up, quite often because of wrong advice or misunderstanding leading to those difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Circumstances do change for students throughout the years they may be involved in study. They change courses or the load level of the course; they may move from a full-time to a part-time study arrangement or defer their study for some time. All these changes in circumstances can cause problems and misunderstandings which may not be addressed until some time after the situation has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ideally, all young people up to the age of 21 or 22 should be involved in some kind of education and training. It is clearly to their personal benefit; it is to society's benefit; and the costs of that education and training should be shared by both. That is not to say that individuals and society at large should contribute equally in an up-front financial sense. In any event, the money for our education system ultimately comes first from the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must operate in a policy framework within a set of attitudes that reflect a distinction between participating in education and training and doing something which may be other than that. That means continuing to have income support systems which differentiate between those two states of affairs. I must pay a particular compliment to the staff of the secretariat for their work in conducting the proceedings and in the preparation of this report. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak to the Austudy report. In my opinion, the introduction of the Austudy scheme in 1986-87 was a great step forward from its immediate predecessor, TEAS, in improving assistance to eligible secondary and tertiary students. I suppose the problems that students have encountered with Austudy stem from an expectation that has been erroneously built over time; that is, the introduction of Austudy was, and probably still is, perceived as being built upon the principles and objectives of TEAS that were in circulation in the 1970s. Therefore, in my view, it is incumbent that student bodies, DEET, and all of those other organisations and individuals who have a role related to Austudy push for the objectives and principles of Austudy to be clearly defined. To that end, a level of certainty has to be reached in the administration and delivery of the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the coalface&mdash;for example, the institutions&mdash;any changes to the scheme need to be clearly made to the students. Therefore, the recommendation that DEET, in consultation with other relevant bodies, develop a proposal for training and support of university students and a welfare officer on campus to advise the students about their rights, to my mind, is paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, the difficulties that I heard students were experiencing were related to the failure to communicate. In this day and age, there should not be that failure, particularly with the information technology streams that are coming into high schools and tertiary colleges. Those sorts of things should be available for students to access information and, therefore, communication ought not be the problem that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the good outcomes that I discovered from the hearings is the significant changes that have been accomplished by DEET and the DSS working party. The fact that a body is in place and working constantly on improvement is encouraging, but it has to be ongoing. I am, therefore, very confident that in a short period of time the current difficulties experienced, for example, by the full-time/part-time student dilemma will be addressed and resolved.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it must be made clear to the students that the onus is upon them to understand fully the Austudy scheme and, with good qualified advice available on campus, many of the complaints currently received will, I hope, be resolved in time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the coalition to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995&mdash;the purpose of which is to increase the income tax rate from 33 to 36 per cent. This will provide additional income for the government in the next financial year of $320-odd million, and in the following three years between $1 billion and $1 1/2 billion or something of that order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation comes before the Senate as a testament to the hypocrisy and fiscal treachery of the Labor government. The legislation demonstrates the high or, perhaps more correctly, the low point of this government's deceit of the Australian people. It reinforces how out of touch is this government, which, all Australians will remember, was responsible for driving this nation into deep recession just four years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members, together with their leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), just do not understand, or refuse to acknowledge, what is happening to Australians who are seeking to make a living from business. They do not recognise that the last thing Australian businesses need now is for the government to grab an extra three per cent of any profit they may be able to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a nine per cent tax increase, while inflation is one-third of that amount. The legislation is a blunt fiscal instrument designed to attack all Australian businesses as a result of the success of a few. It is important to recognise that since the recession of 1990 all Australian businesses have sought to rationalise their overheads and operating expenses and become more internationally and domestically competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to listen to this government, we would have to believe that all businesses in Australia were flourishing. We would have to believe that all Australian businesses were so flush with cash that they could give up three per cent of their profits without altering their behaviour in any way. We would have to believe that taking this money from companies would not have any effect on employment. We would have to believe that taking this money from companies would have no effect on investment. Plainly, we would have to believe in an economic model without any sense of reality. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) clearly believes in these scenarios. In his budget speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that the economy is growing strongly it is appropriate that the corporate sector make a contribution to the tightening of fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us examine the Treasurer's statement in detail. He claims that the economy is growing strongly. For the past month we have all heard from the government's economic ministers statements proclaiming how Australia's economic growth is slowing&mdash;no fear of inflation; no fear of rising interest rates; the new level of interest rates, whatever that may be, will be sustainable. Whatever `sustainable' might mean&mdash;and I add that Treasury officials during estimates this week have been reluctant to define what `economically sustainable' is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the clear and undeniable fact is that economic growth, the level of activity in the community, is slowing. The real question is: by how much?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government currently estimates that GDP will grow by 3.75 per cent over the next financial year. However, recent forecasts by the OECD suggest the Treasury figures may be on the high side, given the forecast of economic growth in our region and for our major trading partners. In addition, the private sector is forecasting a rate of growth significantly less than the figure forecast by Treasury. A Reuters survey released last week estimated growth of 3.2 per cent. Australia's most successful bank, NAB, estimates growth of 2.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the budget was handed down the US and Japanese economies have exhibited significant structural problems that almost certainly will lead to lower industrial production over the next 12 months. Slow or negative economic growth in these economies can only lead to slower than estimated economic growth in Australia. Our enormous foreign debt and the largest current account deficit in the OECD world could lead to higher costs of funds for all businesses and individuals in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This uncertainty in financial markets, together with our anti-competitive labour market, provide causes for real concern as to how Australian businesses will perform over the next 12 months and in the longer term.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The most recent Yellow Pages Small Business Index indicates that the profitability of small business operators surveyed by it has declined over the last five quarters. Of course, expectation amongst those operators is still for things to get better. Those small business operators are the backbone of this economy. They have no choice but to be optimistic. But to be a pessimist with this government is to be a realist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Treasury itself has noted that company profits are on the decline and that the level of profitability is patchy. So much for the Treasurer's justification for this tax increase. The claim that the economy is growing strongly and business can sustain the tax rise is a false and misleading generality. I remind the Senate of the words of the Treasurer on 30 November last year. When commenting upon the reduction in the company tax rate to 33 per cent he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was also done with an eye to structural change, and that is to provide some longer term encouragement to investment.</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1994, the Treasurer also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can't say now the economy is growing well we can rip all that away.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet in May 1995, this year, the Treasurer now says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy is growing strongly. It is appropriate that the corporate sector makes a contribution to the tightening of fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it really possible to miss the contradiction in these statements? I think not. But what is really clear from the words and actions of the Treasurer is this: the Labor government does not understand what is happening to business, particularly to small business, in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter how many times the Prime Minister may say so, this Labor government is not committed to any real structural change in the Australian economy as it affects people conducting businesses. When it comes to the crunch, the government would rather impose an additional tax than take the hard decisions regarding its own expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is a spending addict. They know they cannot afford to spend any more money, but they would rather use credit or take money from someone else than make a saving or institute a cut-back. Let the rest of Australia have less but not this government. I remind the Senate and the community that since 1991-92 Commonwealth outlays have increased by 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reintroducing this tax two years after removing it may be viewed by some as just expedience. The fact is that this decision will hurt all businesses alike regardless of their long-term profitability and it raises no sympathy with the government. The fact that this decision will send the wrong message altogether to international and domestic investors is a matter of trivia, apparently, for this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes this a tax of deceit is the fact that it has been reintroduced by the government without removing the accelerated payment arrangements which the government said previously went hand in hand with the tax reduction in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that the international moves for lower company tax rates have basically been driven by the difficulty of picking up company taxes. We live in a corporate financial world and it is difficult to tie taxes and profits to particular countries. We have to recognise that fact; it is a long-term trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind other non-government senators that the reduction in the company tax rate in 1993 was allied with a move by the government to accelerate company tax payments. What Paul giveth Paul taketh away. The revenue foregone by the government equalled the revenue gained by the government in 1993&mdash;a nice way of balancing the books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate will note, there is no proposal to return the company tax payments structure to the way it was prior to the 1993 amendments. From the government's perspective, there is no need to do so as the revenue benefits have all been garnered from this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just two years ago, the Assistant Treasurer championed the measure as one which would act as a stimulus to business investment. As the lower tax it would increase the level of retained company profits that could be used to finance expansion and future investment&mdash;and also improve the attractiveness of Australia for both domestic and foreign investors. He further claimed that the measures would provide Australian industry with `a most competitive and supportive business tax environment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister claimed the 33 per cent tax rate would be comparable to Singapore and that increases in the rate would only hinder investment. If the government seriously believed that in 1993, why then is it turning 180 degrees two years later?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask all senators to consider if they will what this measure may do to Australian business and to Australia generally. Firstly, it will make all business tax arrangements less competitive compared with our international partners, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. It will require business people to reconsider investment in Australia&mdash;and this is at a time when statistics already show a foreign exodus from the Australian equities market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure will hurt Australian investors as share prices are lowered and dividend returns are reduced. Most significantly, higher taxes will force business to review cost structures. The likely consequence will be either higher prices of goods for which consumers have to pay and, with that, increased inflation, reduced employment and lower business investment. What alternatives does business have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask non-Labor senators to trust their own instincts in respect of the economy. They should think about the state of business, particularly small businesses, in their home state. They should think about how many businesses can afford to pay higher taxes at this very time. In doing so, I ask them to carefully compare the circumstances of those major corporates with high profiles with the circumstances of the vast majority of small and medium businesses. Please do not make this a Pyrrhic victory. Do not punish the majority of businesses for the sake of short-term vengeance against a few. The tax increase should not be seen as an only option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all heard how the government is seeking to blame this chamber once again for the government's economic mismanagement. No member of the public and no member of the press gallery should be fooled by this charade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this tax grab and others contained in the budget were defeated, the government would be forced to take a genuine look at its spending priorities. It may be forced to even seriously consider the recommendations of its central agencies, such as Finance and Treasury, for expenditure control. While the Senate continues to ratify the cheques for the government's expenditure machine, policy and program  evaluation will never occur and waste will continue. We cannot complain that the government ignores the issue of expenditure priority while we continue to provide the mechanism for avoiding the issue. The coalition opposes the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill we are debating is Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995. I will briefly outline the coalition's position on this bill, although I will have some more to say in the committee stage. We are opposing some parts of the bill and will vote against them in the committee stage. We do not oppose the other parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, schedule 1 of this bill makes consequential amendments in relation to the rise of company tax rates. The amendments are designed to ensure that the increasing company tax rate will not apply to the concessional rates of tax for recognised medium and large credit unions for the next two years. The coalition wants to see these concessions retained and will support schedule 1. Should we have thought that the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill would be defeated, we would have opposed this path. Should other non-Labor senators like to prove me wrong on this matter, I will be delighted to hear them and alter the coalition's position. Assuming, however, that the tax increase will be passed, the coalition will not oppose schedule 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, schedule 2 of the bill amends the income tax law to freeze the rate of tax imposed on the eligible insurance business of friendly societies and other registered organisations at 33 per cent for the next two years. In addition, the rebate applying to taxable bonuses paid on life insurance policies issued by friendly societies will increase to 33 per cent from 1 July this year as scheduled, and it will be maintained at that level for the next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to introduce this tax freeze to enable a review of the taxing arrangements that apply to the life insurance business of friendly societies and life assurance companies. The review has been under way since 1989. The legislation does not remove the legislated rise in the tax rate to 39 per cent in 1997-98 and later years. The coalition opposed the increase in tax on friendly societies and other registered organisations in 1993. Therefore, the coalition will not oppose the freeze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reluctantly, we will not oppose the consequential amendments included in this bill in request of the government's proposal to return the sales tax rate on motor vehicles to that which existed prior to the last election. The increase on the tax on motor vehicles was a most cynical and callous tax grab. It deserves to be condemned not only for its hypocrisy but also for its likely consequences for the Australian motor vehicle industry. Nevertheless, as the Senate has already agreed to this tax rise, the coalition will not oppose these consequential amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will oppose the attempts of the government to prevent a common law action for unjust enrichment in the case of sales tax. This is big brother legislation aimed at limiting the rights of citizens to those rights which the government declares a citizen will have. This is dangerous legislation and will be vigorously opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will support the amendments to limit the tax advantaged computer program concession. Since 1 January 1993 taxpayers have enjoyed a concessional taxable value on a wide range of goods such as computers, mobile phones and white goods which contain computer programs housed in reprogrammable microchips. The government has alleged that the exemption has allowed unexpected and large deductions in relation to sales tax. The government maintains that the concession was intended to encourage innovation, but instead it has encouraged wastefulness as manufacturers added non-permanent microchips to their goods in order to qualify for the concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When supporting this proposal originally, the coalition indicated that it did so with some reluctance. The government claims an anomaly has occurred and, to the extent that this measure seeks to merely rectify that situation, again we will not oppose the measure. We do note, however, that it is possible that unintended consequences may come to light as a result of this amendment. In this era of new technology it will always be the case that it is not possible to foresee the entire spectrum of technological possibilities. I would urge the government to closely and thoroughly monitor the effects of the exemption and consider any claims that are made by Australian industry in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will also be moving an amendment in respect of the provisional uplift factor. The government has set the rate at eight per cent for next financial year. The coalition believes that all economic evidence suggests that this figure is too high and proposes that the rate be set at six per cent. I know the government will oppose this amendment. However, I will listen most carefully to the arguments that the government puts forward to justify the eight per cent. Given the most recent economic data, the coalition's proposed rate may even be on the high side. So how an eight per cent rate can be justified is hard to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition stands firm on its commitments to oppose electoral fraud in this country. It is one matter to be forced to amend an electoral commitment in light of serious economic changes which were clearly unforeseen at the time of the commitment; but quite another to make a commitment, be warned of its consequences and then proceed to renege on that commitment, later saying that things are worse than first thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In opposing the increases in taxes in this budget, the coalition does not seek to be negative, as sections of the media would portray; rather, it seeks to enforce the positive responsibility of government to be honest, responsible and an effective manager. The tax measures in this bill are dishonest, irresponsible and negligent management. They are testament to a tired, complacent and arrogant government. The measures deserve to be defeated as they merely repeat and highlight the fraud of 1993. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I know you love debating tax bills all day, every day, but it is hard to make them interesting for 24 hours at a time. What we are talking about is really important. The bills we are talking about this morning are important because they are an important part of this government's deficit reduction strategy. I acknowledge that. They include the key measure to increase the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, by which the government will raise $320 million in 1995-96 and $1,590 million in 1996-97. The bills also contain some of the key base protection measures on sales tax. These measures, collectively, are worth about $150 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our discussions with the government we requested that the bill setting the provisional tax uplift factor for small business for 1995-96 be brought forward. We thank the government for agreeing to do that. The government's resolve to set the uplift factor for 1995-96 at eight per cent, which is two per cent higher than the estimated growth in per capita national income, means the government will raise an extra $170 million in 1995-96 by setting the uplift factor at this rate. That is money that will have to be paid back to small business with interest as a refund in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be supporting the increase in company tax and will reluctantly support the base protection measures. We will be seeking to reduce the uplift factor. We will also be moving a number of amendments to the company tax collection arrangements for small businesses to lessen the impact of the company tax rise on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked for the provisional tax uplift factor to be debated cognately with the company tax in order to use the forum to highlight the problems with small business taxation, not just under company tax but also under provisional tax. About 80 per cent of small businesses are unincorporated and therefore fall under the provisional tax system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I don't know about that. You are prepared to do it this year. We need to debate it to test your credentials this year. You said, `We cannot do it now; we will do it next year. We put the government on notice.' Well, here we are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we were not able to achieve that last year, we said, `Let's have a look at the whole issue of taxation of small business.' I moved to establish a Senate inquiry and that inquiry reported yesterday. It received 68 submissions and the evidence was pretty overwhelming that small business remains concerned that tax is so often collected before the income is earned and that the timing of tax payments upon the cash flow of small businesses can significantly effect both their initial and ongoing viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of most concern to small business operators was the unfairness of the provisional tax uplift factor. With that factor being set at eight per cent for next year&mdash;which, as we have said, is more than twice the inflation rate&mdash;the government gets $300 million worth of tax. While it is tax that will be refunded, it is the timing of the payment of that tax that creates the cash flow problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Office submission to the inquiry highlighted just how much money the government is making out of provisional tax. In the three years from 1991 to 1993 the government collected an average of $367 million more in provisional tax than you could argue it was entitled to because of an excessive uplift factor. The uplift factor was set at 10 per cent when the inflation rate was nudging eight per cent. Inflation has fallen by six per cent but the uplift factor has only fallen by two per cent. That means that small business is forced to pay provisional tax on income deemed to be eight per cent higher than the income for the previous year. That is a lot higher than the average growth in provisional taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the committee stage, along with the opposition, we will be seeking to reduce the uplift factor to six per cent. That takes into account the change in incomes because of inflation and general economic growth. According to Treasury and ABS projections, over the next four years GDP income per capita is expected to grow at a rate slightly above or slightly below six per cent. To provide certainty for small business, we will also be seeking to abolish the default rate of ten per cent and replace it with six per cent, which represents a reasonable income growth rate over the next four years, the years for which government projections are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also indicated to the government that we would be seeking to lessen the impact of the company tax rise on small business. When the company tax rate was dropped in 1983, the government partly compensated the cost of it by bringing forward company tax payment times. Small companies balancing in June had until 15 February to finalise their tax; after 1993, this was brought forward to 1 December. Medium companies were required to pay 85 per cent by 28 September, following a June balance, with the rest due by 15 February. After 1994, 25 per cent was brought forward to 1 June, with a further 25 per cent due on 1 September, 1 December and 1 February. I thought that was a very clever way of paying for reductions in tax. Unfortunately, it has caught up with the government, so it has got to lift the overall rate again. But it worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the company tax cut from 1993 has been cut in half, I think it is appropriate to partly revise these payment times; and we propose that the payment time for small companies be put back to 1 February and that the quarterly payments for small companies commence on 30 June rather than 1 June. That might seem a technicality, but finding the money means a big difference for business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments do not reduce the amount of tax payable; they just give small business a little more time to get their often understandably chaotic affairs in order. I will be moving amendments in this regard in the committee stage, and I will also be moving to increase the threshold for small businesses from a tax liability of $8,000 to a liability of $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this is that, following the One Nation statement, this cut-off was set at $20,000, and the reduction to $8,000 was part of the bringing forward of repayment times  needed to pay for the tax rate cut. The higher tax rate will mean that, if the $8,000 figure is not changed, 5,000 small businesses will find themselves without an increase in income&mdash;pushed up from small companies category to the medium category&mdash;and those things make a difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the company tax increase, we are disappointed that the government did not look more seriously at our suggestion for an alternative minimum company tax. Based on the performance of the tax in the United States, a minimum tax could have raised close to the same amount of money as the three per cent increase without penalising any honest tax paying company. I said at the time that I would have preferred the government to have gone for the fair hit rather than the king hit, because alternative minimum company tax is designed to make sure that companies are not able to use a wide variety of tax planning advice to eliminate their tax responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us still have vivid memories of the 2c in the dollar tax rates that the Bond Corporation and Skase's Qintex were able to achieve. While the situation has improved&mdash;I would say noticeably; I would not say brilliantly, because I have heard people from the Business Council and others say, `But we pay at least 14 per cent now'&mdash;there are still plenty of major corporations with tax rates less than 10 per cent. You can easily find out who they are. Some in the top 100 companies still include News Corporation, FAI Life Insurance, QBE Insurance, James Hardie Industries and ERG Australia. A minimum company tax would require these companies to pay 20c in the dollar on a broader definition of `income', close to the ordinary statement of income provided to the stock exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax is a Ronald Reagan initiative; it is hardly radical. It does not make it wrong either&mdash;I saw you look, Senator McMullan&mdash;which might have been my initial reaction. In the United States, this tax raised overall company tax collections by eight per cent, and that would represent about a billion dollars here. By cracking down on tax minimisation, the government could have sought to maintain a highly competitive headline company tax rate. As the Pender and Ross EPAC paper earlier this year showed&mdash;and as I have heard others say this morning&mdash;this tax rate is very important in making Australia a good place in which to invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe that a company tax rate of 36 per cent is unsustainable. We can see that it will move Australia's corporate tax rate from the lower end of the field to the middle of the field, and a company tax rate of 36 per cent is not unreasonable if you compare it to some other countries&mdash;40 per cent in Canada, 50 per cent in Germany, 56 per cent in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I spoke with a lot of companies they were very philosophical about this increase saying that they could see it coming. They did not like the fact that it was three per cent; they thought two per cent would have been fairer given the circumstances, but there certainly was not the huge outcry that may have been predicted by others. In some respects I was a little surprised by that myself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to mention the issue of tax advantage computer software for which we take some responsibility, and I acknowledge that. I remember in 1992 I moved an amendment to expand the exemption for TACPs to cover software contained on reprogrammable microchips, the old EPROMs, and I never want to hear the word again. We did it to assist Australian-made software producers and to ensure that the Australian software industry was not disadvantaged by the taxation system. The emphasis was on Australian ownership, Australian employment and Australian export opportunities. I thought that was a sound position, but I guess I had not taken into account the Australian accountants' culture of seeking to find every little loophole to exploit where they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was meant to be a limited exemption, but it is being used, I acknowledge, for a wide range of unintended consequences. So we have seen claims lodged for the software components of whitegoods such as microwave ovens, the software contained in motor vehicles, in photocopiers and so forth&mdash;all potentially under this exemption. We saw the exemption claimed by goods where the software was produced entirely overseas, which must be the ultimate contradiction in what was intended. We considered limiting the exemption to goods where software was a substantial part of the good or where the software was wholly produced in Australia, but we have reluctantly conceded that any formulation is likely to be too difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I regard the law as it stands post this amendment as unsatisfactory. We are prepared to agree to rescind the exemption for reprogrammable chips if for no other reason than to beat the accountants. I still have grave doubts that it will, because it remains possible for a company selling a good with a substantial software component to sell the software separately on a floppy disk, later mounted on the good after the sale, and in that way to avoid the tax. I really hope we are not replacing one leaky law with another one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really do not like the culture in this country of accountants and large accountancy firms touting for business and seeking to erode the revenue base with no thought for the consequences. We will see this again when we later debate the diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office has raised with Senator Cook's office the problem that Australian software producers have come to rely on this exemption for their economic survival. That may be a good or a bad thing. I do not actually believe in level playing fields; I do not think it is wrong to pick some winners for some totally justifiable criteria. We have sought assurances that some form of transitional assistance will be made available to these firms, particularly in the mobile phone industry, and we have been assured by Senator Cook's office that the government is committed to ensuring that these firms survive and that an appropriate assistance plan is being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that my support for this exemption depends on that progress on the traditional assistance being made. If the Australian software producers in our vitally important telecommunications industry look like going under, then I will be beating on Senator Cook's door wanting to know why we should not again raise this tax measure and any other form of reasonable assistance to ensure that we do our best to retain a domestic telecommunications software industry. Those are the main areas of the bills we are currently debating that the Democrats want to canvass. The rest of it will be covered in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill and the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill and acknowledge that my colleague Senator Gibson has put the coalition's position with regard to the tax measures involved. I want to speak about the provisional tax uplift factor and the effect that is having on small business and taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kernot rightly said, yesterday the Senate Economics Committee produced a report in which the provisional tax uplift factor was canvassed. I note that this year the government has chosen an eight per cent uplift factor. We have stated that a six per cent uplift factor is reasonable and justifiable&mdash;if it is possible to justify any set figure for the uplift factor. We are aware that it is necessary to make a responsible change and a responsible recommendation that is not going to have too great an effect on the government's anticipated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important and necessary to bear in mind that the provisional tax uplift factor is essentially a method of bringing forward anticipated tax receipts. It is therefore a timing device. It is all to do with timing. It is not a particular impost. The amount of tax for which provisional taxpayers are liable will not be affected in dollar terms by the provisional tax uplift factor, regardless of its quantum or form. What will be affected is when that money will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisional tax uplift factor was introduced at 7.5 per cent and it rose to 12 per cent before it became installed in the section of the income tax acts at a default rate of 10 per cent subject to parliamentary discretion. That is really what we are talking about today. The government has set the uplift factor at eight per cent for the two previous financial years and this year the government is again proposing that it will be eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should a provisional taxpayer consider that his or her taxable income will not increase by the amount predicted in the uplift factor, or that their income will decline during the remainder of the forthcoming year, they have the option of lodging a variation of their provisional tax. This adds compliance cost, which is an additional cost to small business. But there is also the problem that if the variation understates actual income by more than 15 per cent, the onus is on the taxpayer to make a case as to why the underestimation occurred; otherwise they may be subject to penalties, including the culpability factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the inquiry one of the issues we looked at was that of the culpability factor and whether it was fair on taxpayers. The fact that we only have that small window of 15 per cent in which to lodge a variation and have it assessed deters some people from putting in a variation because they are not sure, with the fluctuations in their incomes, that it is possible for them to accurately predict that they can fit into that window. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the committee proposed that the culpability factor be removed and, instead, that underpaid taxation should be penalised at a levy which is at the highest commercial bank interest rate. Having to pay the highest commercial bank interest rate is penalty enough in itself. There is no advantage in understating income because the taxpayer will be penalised at the highest commercial rate for the amount understated. That penalty is all that is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint submission by the Taxation Office and the Treasury to the inquiry dealt with the provisional tax uplift factor. The submission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of aggregate income that should be subject to provisional tax is difficult to predict with accuracy.</PARA>
<PARA>The tax office is telling us that it is difficult to predict it with accuracy; yet we have this eight per cent being proposed by the government. By the Treasury's own admission outcomes have not matched predictions. As the submission says, if you look at the actual data you will find that in a lot of cases the provisional tax uplift factor, compared with what actually happened, varies quite a lot. The tax office itself is saying that the record is not good. However, this year the government is recommending an eight per cent uplift factor for provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the actual data that is supplied by Treasury, it reveals little, if any, correlation between the uplift factor and the actual annual changes in taxable income for all provisional income earners. The committee acknowledges the thoroughness that is employed by the Treasury in attempting to take into account the widest range of relevant considerations when formulating a provisional tax uplift factor. It even pointed out that the subjectiveness of the process was evidenced by the need to utilise indicators such as long-range weather forecasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was particularly in relation to the primary industry sector, where it is talking about projections of drought easing successively over the next couple of years. Volume growth should be exceptionally strong. When the Treasury has to start looking at the long-range weather forecast to see at what rate the uplift factor should be applied to certain areas of the economy, that defies all explanation. If we were to go to any academic and say, `One of the issues that we will have to take into account is whether it will rain or not' and try to predict that accurately, it would be stretching things a bit too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommended remedy for provisional taxpayers whose growth of income is expected to be less than the eight per cent that the government wants to put in place is to lodge a request to vary their provisional tax instalments. The committee received a considerable amount of evidence concerning the usefulness of this facility and has found it to be deficient in its current form. Having taken into account all of the evidence that we possibly could, we found that the facility of varying provisional tax is deficient in its current form. That is partly because many provisional taxpayers have fluctuating incomes which are very difficult to predict for more than a few weeks ahead, let alone most of the year, particularly if a taxpayer wishes to lodge a variation very early in the accounting period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, as pointed out in a number of submissions and in evidence, many provisional taxpayers would not be in a position to lodge a request to vary until the final quarter of their accounting period because the 15 per cent margin of understatement allowed under the legislation is far too narrow for these taxpayers. It could create considerable hardship for taxpayers who suffer reductions of income, as their provisional tax assessment may be based on what may well be much higher levels of income from a previous year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that about 12 per cent of provisional taxpayers lodge variations, although in many cases by doing so they are faced with additional compliance costs in the form of additional accountancy fees. This places an extra burden on the taxpayers, who are already likely to be in far tighter financial circumstances because of the reduction of their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the consequences of a high provisional tax uplift factor, assuming that the tax uplift factor is high, which is what we are saying in this debate. The Taxation Office acknowledges that the reality is that at an individual taxpayer level there will probably be a greater number who will be below that average and far fewer who will be in excess of it. In other words, the rates at which the provisional tax uplift factor have been set since 1991 have resulted in the tax office never having lost any net provisional tax revenue&mdash;in fact, considerably exceeding what was required to be remitted in advance by provisional taxpayers in some of those years since 1991. Thus, the tax office has had a considerable benefit from the uplift factor being, on average in the past three years, far too high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of any factor which attempts to express an average rise in projected income upon this numerically very large disparate and volatile section of the business is clearly inappropriate. There are a number of alternatives, some of which are not very palatable, either to the government or to people who are trying to predict into the future. One would be to abolish the uplift factor altogether. While this would undoubtedly be very popular with provisional taxpayers, it is fair to say that the deferral of over half a billion dollars of revenue would probably rule this out as a possibility either in the short term or even in the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost all of the submissions and evidence received during the committee hearings from the private sector&mdash;and one of the three submissions received from the public sector&mdash;opposed the current level of the provisional tax uplift factor. The most frequently stated reason was that the provisional tax uplift factor was far in excess of inflation. Those who did not advocate its abolition&mdash;and there were many who did&mdash;generally recommended that the provisional tax uplift factor be fixed at either the current or projected inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that in the report that was brought down yesterday in this chamber, the economics committee recommended that the provisional tax uplift factor be set at a level no higher than the current or projected annual movement of the CPI. In making that recommendation, which we would like the government to consider, we realise that if that method was to come in immediately and be taken as a proposition for the coming year, it would have a severe impact on government revenue. In order for it to be put into place there needs to be some time allowed for the rate to move to the CPI. For that reason, the coalition responsibly has decided that it will support a six per cent uplift factor for this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some justification for us doing that. Last year, when the uplift factor was an issue in October, as Senator Kernot mentioned, the Democrats moved for the provisional tax uplift factor to be reduced. The reason we opposed the Democrats position was that we felt the government needed some time to allow for the impact on revenue that move would have. However, at that time, the coalition put the government on notice that it was considering its position with regard to the provisional tax uplift factor and since that time the government has made no move to change from the eight per cent that it had last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no justification for eight per cent. It is very difficult in some cases to justify an uplift factor at all because it presumes, averaging over all businesses, that a business is likely to make a greater income next year than it did this year; and a greater income the following year than in the previous year. It simply is not the case, because there are so many factors that need to be taken into consideration when determining whether a business has been successful and its income is rising. It varies between professions. Yet this one factor is arbitrarily rated at eight per cent by the government. It says it has taken a lot of factors into account. One I mentioned was the weather. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We apply an average over a whole range of businesses and then say to them, `If you are not doing so well this year put in a variation to your provisional tax.' What we are doing at that stage is placing additional burdens on businesses, in many cases small businesses, which are already feeling the pinch. It is putting extra pressure on those small businesses when they can least afford for it to happen. If a small business needs to vary its provisional tax downward, it is because its income has dropped; yet we have a standard rate of provisional tax uplift factor which is very difficult to justify in any case. Certainly, if there is to be an uplift factor&mdash;and because there has been one in place for a considerable time, I concede that it cannot be taken away immediately because of the impact on revenue&mdash;at least the rate at which it is going to be applied should be considered in the current economic climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that in mind, I support totally the coalition's proposed amendment that for this year the uplift factor be six per cent. We think that if it is at six per cent, business communities, particularly the small business community which it will affect most of all, will at least have some acceptance that we are trying to do something to get the provisional tax uplift factor down to what they would consider to be an acceptable level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995 is a complex bill. The major issues in this bill for the Greens relate to provisional tax and tax refunds. The bill includes consequential amendments relating to luxury cars, but we do not have any issue with that section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisional tax is paid for the year in advance and affects anyone who is self-employed. This is actually a large portion of small business, where business profit is taken as personal income rather than paid at the company tax rate. Provisional tax is paid on the year ahead, although payment is not due until significantly after that date; that is, nine months after, so that payment can largely be based on real returns. Provisional tax calculates that there will normally be an increase in income each year above the increase in consumer prices and GDP growth. It says that this increase is taken to be 10 per cent. This figure, the provisional uplift factor, may be adjusted by parliament if there is an annual exception or an adjustment to the base figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing to set the tax at eight per cent this year. The coalition is proposing to change the rate from eight per cent to six per cent this year. The Democrats are proposing to change the normal factor from 10 per cent to six per cent. We think this is probably a more reasonable figure and a way to go about it. The Democrats are also moving an amendment to protect small businesses that have been incorporated as companies from the consequences of changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first measure is to adjust the classification of small business so that the increase in company tax does not result in their being reclassified without any real increase in income. This is a consequence of the classification which divides companies on the basis of tax liability. There are a number of anomalies in relation to this classification, since profit&mdash;and, hence, liability&mdash;can be adjusted somewhat. If you change the rate from 33 per cent upwards, it will be a bit like a tax net&mdash;more companies will fall into that net without there being any change in what they actually earn or the size of their business. We are going to support these two measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure is to change the date by which claims must be filed. These were brought forward and there have apparently been a number of problems with this. They will now partially be put back. This is less clear in relation to where we should fall&mdash;one side or the other&mdash;so we will be listening carefully to the arguments to make a decision on these particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue is tax refunds. The coalition is suggesting they should be struck out. Tax collected under the tax regimes is collected by wholesalers, but they are not obliged to pay government until 28 days after the bill receives royal assent. Tax may also be collected or paid wrongly; for example, when a business applies a wrong rate of tax to an item. This can occur as classifications are not always obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that case, they are entitled to a refund but, under sales tax laws, can obtain it only if they can prove they have not charged their customers or they can show they have returned the overpayment. The latter is unlikely to occur and the former is very difficult to prove, since sales price is simply a price and not a price plus X amount of tax. Companies can argue that they absorb the tax out of profit, but this is hard to prove, since profit levels are also not separable or established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies are unlikely to admit they have overcharged or go to the time, expense and trouble of finding and refunding overpayments and then apply to the tax office for a refund, when they can only get a refund on the tax returned by them. Therefore, they make no money from a process which is embarrassing and costs money. The only time it would occur would be if they were caught by customers and could not deny overpayment and were so embarrassed they needed to act. In other words, refunds are unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other option is a common law claim. If a claim is made and is successful, it is evidence of overcharging, and retailers have a case to make similar claims against the wholesalers on the same common law ground. If they win, the customers could claim against them. All this is difficult and complex. The customers have little understanding of their options. The Greens will therefore be putting forward amendments to require customer information to be advanced in relation to sales tax changes. We certainly want this to be part of legislation so that it actually becomes a normal part of the way bills are presented in relation to sales tax so that people and businesses know their rights and obligations. This is the least we can do to help sort out the confusion that arises as a result of any such changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not speak for long on these measures because of the time constraints under which we are unfortunately working in this last day and a half of these sittings. This legislation deals with a number of matters. It specifically deals with the company tax rate change. Senator Gibson made some very important points about that matter. Not only individual voters but also the companies in this country, which are, in large part, the employers of those voters, are entitled to certainty. Undertakings were given by the government prior to the last election. We saw, as has been pointed out, various excuses being made as to why this particular tax should be adjusted one way or the other&mdash;downwards if there is an election looming. Now we have an election looming and it is being proposed that it should go upwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter relates to the taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations. If the prior matter to which I have referred is defeated, then that provision is not necessary anyhow. The bill also deals with tax advantaged computer programs, consequential changes and the uplift factor. It also deals with the question of sales tax refunds, to which Senator Margetts has just adverted. It is on that matter that I want to say a couple of choice words. This whole question is a very great matter of principle for parliament. This legislation is attempting to entrench a narrow base for refunds of moneys paid to the Taxation Office in respect of sales tax. The Taxation Office is unlawfully retaining that money. That is the issue that is involved here. The money has been paid to the Taxation Office and it is unlawfully retaining that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be a whole host of arguments put forward by the government, and it has done so on this matter. It has also been dealt with by other speakers&mdash;Senator Gibson, Senator Kernot and Senator Margetts. I do not want to go into the detail but I want to address the question of the Taxation Office holding moneys that are unlawfully obtained. This is a fundamental question about the purpose of parliament. I refer to the proposal in this legislation to strip people of their common law rights to recover sales tax that is unlawfully demanded by the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>

I do not claim to have known King Charles I, though my ancestors on the Harradine side lived in the surrounds of London&mdash;rather poorly, I must say. They looked to the parliament, of course, to be their protector. </PARA>

As Dicey enunciated in his monumental <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law of the Constitution</EMPHASIS> the principle of the rule of law is the firm rock upon which our constitutional arrangements rest. The Queen is not above the law. The Governor-General is not above the law. The Prime Minister is not above the law. None of us is above the law, nor is the Commissioner of Taxation above the law. This principle is enunciated in the Judiciary Act which provides that where the Commonwealth is a litigant with a private party it is generally to be in the same position as any other litigant. </PARA>

It is by definition not a law with respect to taxation to allow a tax officer to demand and retain payment of an unlawful tax. I must admit to my colleagues that this is merely offered as an indication. I have not studied it, but it seems to me that it is not a law with respect to taxation to allow a tax officer to demand and retain payment of an unlawful tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995. This bill is an omnibus bill that will cover a wide range of amendments to the taxation law to implement the government's budget proposals. I wish to confine my remarks to two particular issues that this bill covers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with schedule 3. I certainly welcome the presence of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) in the chamber, because this is a very important bill that needs his consideration for the continued existence of the very small telecommunications industry in Australia. When I say very small, I am referring to the people who design and manufacture hand-held phones in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I am strongly opposed to the amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act, which seek to remove the concessional treatment given to products that contain computer programs embodied in the non-permanent microchip. I note all the arguments put forward by the minister. The concession has encouraged manufacturers to use non-permanent microchips simply to get at the tax concession, resulting in a miscalculation of resources. The concession has led to a loss of sales revenue, promoted inequities in the marketplace and created anomalies for taxpayers. That may well have been the result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kernot said, this amendment was supported by the coalition and the Democrats in 1992. In our opinion, it advances technology and locally produced telecommunications equipment. For that reason, we put it through. As will happen in such cases, everyone wants to get in on the bandwagon. As Senator Kernot also said, it has been extended to many other industries, such as cars and whitegoods. I would have thought it was a simple matter to put through an amendment which would restrict the taxation concession to the telecommunications industry, as was originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central proposition advanced by the minister that business has sought to utilise non-permanent microchips simply to avail itself of the sales tax exemption could be right, but in the telecommunications industry it is absurd. Non-permanent microchips are increasingly used as a consequence of technological advancement in product development. The use of non-permanent microchips allows newly developed programs to be downloaded into the product as they are developed. This could be used as a means of product differentiation from products using permanent microchips which must be totally replaced when new programs are developed. The government's amendments will act to penalise technological advancement in the rapidly changing field of software development and encourage the continued use of antiquated technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook rightly says&mdash;he reminds us almost ad nauseam at question time&mdash;that Australia has to be at the cutting edge of technology. He promotes that as Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. That is great. We on this side of the parliament support him. Here is an advanced method of technology, and the minister is going to put 13 pounds of lead in the saddle and pull it wide on a wet track. He is going to hurt the small, hand-held components section of the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes no sense to discriminate in this fashion between manufacturers of computer programs. It is particularly illogical to give the advantage to manufacturers who are utilising outmoded practices involving floppy disk against manufacturers at the forefront of new technology who, because of the nature of their product, as is the case with cellular phones, are compelled to download the software into microchips. It is foreseeable that, far from removing sales tax avoidance practices by manufacturers of computer programs, these amendments could simply give rise to a different method of tax avoidance. For example, as the legislation levies a tax advantage for computer programs that have not been embodied in microchips, manufacturers of computer programs could possibly avoid sales tax by selling the program separately from the device in which the program is to be used&mdash;in other words, by means of selling a floppy disk and the actual product and then downloading the floppy disk into the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Practices such as these will result in their own miscalculation of resources which, in all likelihood, would be greater than any alleged miscalculation of resources by computer program manufacturers using non-permanent microchips to escape sales tax under the present arrangements. There would also be a misallocation of Taxation Office resources as tax bureaucrats would have to police whether the program was removed before or after the point of sale. Removal of the sales tax concession would repudiate key provisions in the Radiocommunications Act 1992 which is described as designed to provide a regulatory environment to maximise opportunities for the Australian communications industry in domestic and international markets. That is part of Senator Cook's policy on technological advancement in the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Removing one of the few benefits that local industry currently has over overseas competitors, which hold such market power, allows them to subsidise the sale of phones at a low cost. I am not sure whether they are subsidised or they are dumped but one thing I am sure of is that it would be impossible to retail phones at such low prices in the market at the moment without their being either dumped or heavily subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving advantages to the imported games and entertainment cartridge industry makes absolutely no sense. You are putting a handicap on an industry that is worth billions of dollars around the world while allowing computer games to go through without a similar tax. You are taxing the technology of the phone industry while allowing computer games a free kick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's assessment of the loss of sales tax revenue following on the alleged practice of manufacturers of computer programs of using reprogrammable microchips&mdash;or EPROMs, as we know them here&mdash;instead of permanent microchips in order to gain a tax benefit, is greatly overstated in the telecommunications industry. According to the minister, the removal of this concession will raise $10 million in 1994-95, $150 million for 1995-96, and $185 million by 1998-99. Those figures are illusionary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telecommunications market is presently dominated by the major carriers of Telecom and Optus, and those two companies engage in the practice of substantially subsidising the sales of cellular mobile phones to get the people who buy those phones to connect to their networks. They are not selling phones; they are subsidising phones to get people to connect to their networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, phones are being purchased by the retail dealers at very nominal prices from the two major carriers, which are buying in bulk and distributing the phones to retail distributors at very nominal prices. So sales tax, in the vast majority of the telecommunications market, is derived from a very small base. This is causing severe damage to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only remaining Australian designers and manufacturers of cellular phones are NEC and Voxson, and they are finding it difficult to afford to subsidise their phones in this way. The sales tax yield is therefore derived from the sales of these manufacturers, which is a very low base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now, the concession has lessened the blow suffered by the local manufacturers trying to compete with the companies subsidising their phone sales. In particular, the concession has enabled one of the two local manufacturers, Voxson, to develop the GSM telephone, which is the latest technology in the industry. Voxson is the only company developing GSM within Australia. While I have the minister's ear, I want to tell him that there are billions of dollars of sales of the new GSM technology throughout the world but Australia will miss the bus if something is not done about these two remaining companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This development and others are now jeopardised by the government's change in policies. The revenue forgone from exempting imported entertainment and educational cartridges far exceeds the increase in revenue to be gained from the Australian telecommunications industry as a result of the government's amendments. In view of the critical anomalies raised and the fact that the likely effect of the removal of this concession will severely disadvantage the Australian telecommunications industry, I strongly urge the government to reconsider the amendments. I can strongly urge it as much as I like, and I know that I am not going to win there, but I ask Senator Cook to come up with some alternative form of assistance to an industry that can provide Australia with billions of dollars of export sales if it is allowed to get on the front foot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to schedule 10 of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill, another important issue, which amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to set the provisional tax uplift factor at eight per cent for 1995-96, as foreshadowed in this budget. The provisional tax uplift factor&mdash;the amount by which the previous year's taxable income of an unincorporated business increased in order to calculate provisional tax in that business's current year of income&mdash;impinges very heavily on the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At eight per cent, the uplift factor is double the growth rate and three times the inflation rate. Small business&mdash;or what is remaining of small business after the high interest regime in the 1980s&mdash;is really going to feel the pinch and is being used as a milking cow for the government's budget surplus, or its attempt to get a budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government introduced the uplift factor in its current form at 10 per cent. The taxation laws amendment bill and a joint Treasury and Australian Taxation Office submission to the Senate inquiry into the taxation treatment of small business provided no clear explanation of the rationalisation for the level of the uplift. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of the uplift factor is intended to be a reasonable reflection of the growth in income of provisional taxpayers. The level cannot be predicted with accuracy so it is preferable not to place undue emphasis on a specific forecast or estimate in setting the factor. Matters such as inflation effects are taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasury and Australian Tax Office joint submission, included in the preliminary issues paper released by the Senate Economics References Committee, stated that the level of aggregate income that should be subject to provisional tax is difficult to predict with accuracy. We agree with that. But this year and for the past three years the uplift factor has been set by the government at eight per cent, despite the fact that the 1995-96 forecasts for growth and inflation were 3.75 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forecasts for growth and inflation for 1994-95 are 5.75 per cent and three per cent. Growth for 1993-94 was 4.3 per cent and the inflation rate was 1.8 per cent. Yet the uplift factor has remained at eight per cent. In 1992-93, the growth was three per cent and inflation was one per cent, but we still had the uplift factor at eight per cent. Even at the height of the recession, in 1991-92, with growth at almost minus figures&mdash;0.8 per cent&mdash;and inflation at a minimum of 1.9 per cent, the uplift factor was retained at 10 per cent. There is no excuse for an uplift factor to be set at 10 per cent and actually charged at eight per cent. I am finding it very hard to support the uplift factor at even six per cent. The legislated uplift factor of 10 per cent and charged at eight per cent is an arbitrary figure, and it is almost just plucked out of the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business sector has sought an uplift factor that is more in line with the inflation rate and the growth figures of around two or three per cent. Treasury figures indicate that every one per cent of the uplift factor translates into $100 million in tax revenue for the government. So the government is extracting from the small business sector something like $600 million a year that it does not deserve and cannot reasonably claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This huge slug is to be taken out of the small business sector, out of the economy, to boost the government's coffers so it can run around and say that it has a budget surplus. Senator Schacht, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, should be in the cabinet. I do not know who represents him in the cabinet; maybe it is Senator Cook, who has just raised his hand. If Senator Cook does represent him, then I have to say that he has done a damned lousy job on this issue. I would ask him to lift his game if he is to continue to represent small business in the cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the uplift factor has been extensively canvassed. It is one of the key references of the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into the tax treatment of small business. I think that report was tabled yesterday, although it may have been tabled this morning as I heard Senator Ferguson speaking on that issue. The reference dealing with the uplift factor considered the appropriateness of the quantum and current form of the uplift factor. Cited in the small business issues paper released by the committee in March were 63 submissions received from individual and peak industry bodies. Every single one opposed the provisional tax uplift factor and every one advocated its reduction or complete removal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This view was also supported by a recent survey undertaken by the Institute of Chartered Accountants which showed that almost 96 per cent of the 1,000 respondents believed that an eight per cent uplift factor was unreasonable for the 1995-96 financial year. Over half of the respondents stated that the uplift factor should be pegged at the inflation rate, and that that would be a reasonable assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the committee's findings on small business in relation to taxation and the uplift factor. In conclusion, let me say that small business has suffered probably more than any other sector of the market, apart from the rural sector. About 70,000 small businesses have gone into receivership over the last four years. Setting the uplift factor at eight per cent will only increase the demise of what remains of Australia's small business sector. Let me say this in the final minute of my speech: regional and rural small businesses suffered more than any others. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said last night&mdash;and I do not intend to repeat all the things I said last night but I will make a few relevant points following the debate by honourable senators in this chamber, particularly with regard to the views put by the coalition, the Australian Democrats and the Greens&mdash;the important thing to remember about this year's budget is that it is historic and important. It sets the macro-economic parameters for the management of the Australian economy, which is economic code for saying that it puts the right fundamentals in place. A lot of the debate that we have heard thus far on these bills, if I may characterise it this way, has been nitpicking about details that are necessary in order to deliver the fundamentals. With the greatest respect for the contributors, there has been a lot of crocodile tears shed about small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental truth is that if you get the fundamentals wrong in the economy, and if you undermine the macro settings that we have put in place in this budget for the economy, small business will be the most massive disbeneficiaries. They will pay the price, and they will pay the price in a way unlike anything that you are concerned about here. You are delivering populist and appealing arguments to small business but they cannot be seen outside of the macro context because if you fail on the macro fundamentals you will fail small business across the board in a much more devastating way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is historic because it puts the budget of the Commonwealth of Australia into surplus. This year it goes into surplus by $718 million. That is a surplus achieved by fiscal tightening. We have reduced Commonwealth expenditure, we have also imposed some revenue measures and we have budgeted for asset sales. This year, if this budget is unmaligned, we are in surplus. Next year we are in surplus to the tune of $3.4 billion without any asset sales to prop up the surplus. The following year we are in surplus in excess of $7 billion. Those are structural surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important for the Australian economy that we achieve surplus. It is vitally important, too, that we deliver on our program for a massive medium-term national savings plan which this budget puts in place through the provisions we have made for superannuation. Superannuation works in two important ways. It means that almost all Australians will have superannuation provision made for them to which the government will contribute, to which they will contribute, and to which their employers will contribute. They will be able to look forward to retirement with some dignity and at income levels above that of the aged pension. That is a sensible thing to benefit ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pool of funds that the national superannuation provisions provides is a massive pool of investment owned by Australians to invest in the Australian economy and ensure that there is less foreign ownership or less reliance on investment by foreigners in the Australian economy. They are positive moves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of this budget is to put downward pressure&mdash;I believe quite significant downward pressure&mdash;on interest rates. This budget is a massive signal to the market that this government is responsible; it manages its economy properly and there is pressure downward on interest rates. You fiddle with this budget; you play a quasi-populist game to save a few cents here or a few dollars there and you remove that downward pressure on interest rates and interest rates remain higher, or go up, and as a result no small business operator in Australia will thank you. Small business operators will blame you and it will be your responsibility, not ours. We have said that quite clearly and quite strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to repeat that message. The downward pressure that this budget puts on interest rates is significant. Australian home buyers want to see interest rates fall. You tamper with that downward pressure and interest rates remain constant, or rise, and that is your gift to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Senate last night to pause. Pause again before you go over the brink and commit yourself to this. Last night you did not pause; you went over the brink and you cut revenue measures of the Commonwealth which have reduced the amount of the surplus and have eased, at this stage, some of the downward pressure on interest rates that our budget has put in place. You have done that so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a number of measures here where you are, as I listened to the speakers, proposing to do it again. We have the Senate taking the downward pressure off interest rates. You are easing that pressure back. Once again I say to the Senate: pause before you cross that bridge because business and taxpayers in Australia want to see an economy in which their long-term retirement aspirations can be addressed. Australians want proper access to education for themselves and for their children; they want proper provision for health services within the Commonwealth; and they want a proper safety net for social security. All those things need to be met out of this budget&mdash;and are&mdash;and we in the Labor government have not tampered with those other than to make the targeting of them more effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have found savings within that structure and we now find that the opposition wants to cancel out some of the savings in outlays that we have found and impose higher costs on the taxpayers by returning those savings. The opposition also wants to cancel out some of the tax changes that we are making, principally in the business area, so that there is less income. So it wants to spend more money, but reduce the income and lower the surplus. It says that it is economically responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter how many doorstops the shadow Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, does around this place attacking the federal government, he will not escape the fact that what the commentators&mdash;the informed economic critics&mdash;and the people of Australia will see is an opposition that wants to spend more, raise less, put the budget back into deficit and lift the downward pressure that we have applied to interest rates. That is exactly what is happening here. People around Australia are watching it and the economic commentators are analysing it. </PARA>

As I said, I believe that that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of honourable senators in this debate have raised some specific issues to which I should address myself before I resume my seat. Nothing that I will now say should undercut the weight of the remarks I have made thus far. In this debate it has been foreshadowed that there will be a number of changes to the new company taxation instalment system that the government proposes to introduce. For the importance of the record, I will read into it a number of points that the government would wish to make. The tax issue of greatest concern to small business has been the subject of inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee. The reference was `improving the tax treatment of small business'. The government is committed to responding to that report. We will respond to it and, therefore, it is appropriate to consider the committee's findings before deciding on any further amendments to taxation on small business. The Senate has conducted a report and we will respond to it. Do not move before that opportunity has been created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the intention of the proposed amendments is to relieve small business of some of the costs of doing business, the proposed rescheduling may not be the best method of achieving that objective. Small business, small companies and companies paying small amounts of tax are discernibly different groups. Indeed, most small businesses, particularly those at the lower end of the total business income scale, are not incorporated and therefore would not benefit from special treatment for taxpaying companies. Furthermore, companies with small income tax liabilities may not be small businesses in terms of their accounting profit, assets or number of employees. Any change to the instalment arrangements for small or medium taxpaying companies would be likely to provide an undeserved benefit to subsidiaries of large corporate groups. It might also encourage&mdash;I think this is an important point&mdash;artificial manipulation of subsidiaries in order to capture the associated tax benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new company tax instalment system was designed both to improve the equity of the scheduling of income tax payments for companies vis-a-vis other taxpayers, particularly unincorporated businesses, and reduce the lumpiness of the previous scheduling of payments. Under the previous system, unincorporated businesses generally paid tax earlier than incorporated businesses whose income tax liabilities became due considerably after that income was derived. This difference is diminished by the new instalment regime. I therefore ask honourable senators to consider that and act accordingly by not proceeding with their proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell's and Senator Kernot's remarks raised the question of the microchip tax provision and referred to the impact that may have on some Australian telecommunications companies. I can, for the sake of the record, put more explicitly what it is that the government proposes to do to assist Australian telecommunications companies to become more competitive both within Australia and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original industry development arrangement scheme to promote&mdash;and there is some jargon in this&mdash;CPE products in Australia is due to expire on 30 June 1996. `CPE products' is bureaucratic code for customer premised equipment&mdash;I have as much difficulty with all this jargon as, I am sure, ordinary people do. This equipment includes portable phones, the PABX system or the first phones when that equipment, owned by Telecom, Optus or someone else, is in the customer's premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to reiterate, the original industry development arrangement scheme to promote certain customer premised equipment products in Australia is due to expire on 30 June 1996. The government believes it timely to consider a strategy for the CPE industry within the wider industry development arrangements for the telecommunications industry. The government is committed to developing a national strategy for the communications industry. A key part of that strategy is industry development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, my portfolio colleague, Senator Schacht, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, is leaving Australia to lead a telecommunications industry trade mission throughout South-East Asia. The trade mission will be travelling to Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. He will be accompanied by a whole raft of Australian telecommunications companies as part of this promotional push to encourage the export of Australia's telecommunications excellence to the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to developing a national strategy for the communications industry and a key part of that strategy is industry development. A strategy for CPE is being jointly developed by the Department of Communications and the Arts with my department, Industry Science and Technology. The strategy will be an input into the post-1997 telecommunications review, which is already looking at the wider industry development issues arising from telecommunications reform. This will be part of the package looking at technical regulation issues which will be considered separately after the principal post-1997 considerations. The broadband services export group recommended that the government should require cable network operators involved in broadband service provision to implement development plans for the telecommunications supply industry. This recommendation will be considered as part of a post-1997 review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anticipated growth in telecommunications will provide many opportunities for Australian industry. The ministers&mdash;and I speak for Minister Lee and me in this&mdash;are committed to ensuring that a strategy is in place so that Australia is well placed to capture the emerging opportunities. A key element of that strategy will be working with Australian-owned companies to improve their quality and the applicability of their technology, and to encourage their ability to find niches and broader markets for their products. I say that because of the anxiety raised by Senator Kernot and Senator Boswell. I trust that, with those commitments and reassurances, we can look afresh at the tax measure that is before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a long discussion on this matter. Many of the words that have been spoken have been said before. I do not wish to repeat them, but these are important bills. They go to the efficacy of the budget. Once again, I request senators to have regard to the fundamentals of the economy and our bottom line, put aside their previously pronounced positions and sensibly adopt the proposals brought forward by the government. I commend the bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Ferguson said, it has not worried me before. Last night, I pointed out that a number of my colleagues speaking in this debate&mdash;Senator Tambling, Senator Calvert and Senator Panizza&mdash;have long and distinguished careers and records in local government. Senator Calvert reminded me afterwards that I forgot to mention myself. Of course, it is not for me to say that I had a distinguished career in local government, but I was an elected member of the Burdekin Shire Council for 11 years. So I do understand what local government is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that a number of our candidates who will become members of parliament after the next election are people who currently serve their local communities on local councils. As well, I indicated that the Australian Local Government Association also has a very proud record of looking after the interests of local councils and, through them, ratepayers by its work with the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I concluded, or as I was interrupted by the bell last night, I was saying that that organisation has generally been very responsible and mature. It did go through a period just before the last election when it was headed by a person who, I might say, is not a bad friend of mine, a nice fellow, councillor Peter Wood, who is obviously very much to the left of the political spectrum. Unfortunately, in that period the ALGA became a fraction political because of the influence of Peter Wood and his close association, first of all, with Mr David Simmons and, subsequently, with the current minister, Mr Howe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was emphasising the fact that prior to the last election, the Australian Labor Party had gone around in the mode of deceit that it was in at that time saying, `We're going to have a separate ministry for local government following the election.' Of course, following the election local government disappeared off the portfolio names and now has become a very small part of one of the mega-departments. So that is roughly where I had got to last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are debating is one that, generally speaking, local government supports, although it did have some specific objections to the bill as it was before then. Without my notes, which I have been unable to get, I will not be as specific in this matter as I had intended. But local government was very concerned at its lack of involvement. Promises that had been made to local government in the lead-up to this bill were simply ignored by the government. Perhaps in the committee stage when I have more details of that I will discuss that further. One of the definite promises made to local government on the determination of national principles was not taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that Senator Tambling intended moving a number of amendments to overcome the problems that local government saw in these matters. As a result of the opposition's proposed amendments, I understand that the government has picked up most of them. So, fortuitously through the activities of Senator Tambling and others on our side and the points they have made, the government has agreed to rectify most of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the ALGA and the various state organisations that represent local government on the activities they continue to perform each month of every year in support of their particular constituents who are ratepayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of specific points. I will not keep the Senate long. The local government associations generally were very concerned about the procedures for establishing national principles to guide the allocation of grants amongst councils. Commitments had been made. They were not dealt with in the bill as it was originally drafted. Subsequently, the government has picked up Senator Tambling's amendments and moved them as its own. The associations were also concerned about section 16, which required annual reports to be presented to parliament, and section 3, which sets out the intended objects of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also aware that Senator Tambling has gone through them in some detail. Local government was concerned that the national principles should be formulated in consultation with state ministers and the Australian Local Government Association and should take the form of disallowable instruments. Again, the bill as it was originally drafted was a typical Labor Party bill. The Labor Party makes these arrangements, consults and then ignores them completely. The commitments it made were ignored in the first draft of the bill. Fortunately, through Senator Tambling's amendments, the government has picked them up and is now moving the amendments itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state associations of local government&mdash;WAMA in Western Australia, the Local Government Association of South Australia, the MAV in Victoria, the Tasmanian local government association, the Local Government Association of New South Wales and the Shires Association of New South Wales, the association in the Northern Territory and the Local Government Association of Queensland&mdash;are all very professional bodies that do tremendous work for the councils they represent and, ultimately, the ratepayers. It is a pleasure to be involved in this area of government activity and to work with people who are so professional in the way that they go about things, the research they do and the commitment they give. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My state of Queensland is a very decentralised state. Local government has a huge influence in all parts of Queensland. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, it is the sphere of government that is the closest to the people. In my state of Queensland, it is a very well-respected, well understood and very much needed part of the government system in the country. I fear the day when the Labor Party achieves its ultimate aim of getting rid of the states and local government as we now know it. Any number of senior Labor Party figures have said that they want to get rid of the states and local government and replace them. </PARA>

Even the old socialist countries are now giving all that sort of centralised control away but not this mob over here; that is what it is after. It wants to control every aspect of Australian life. It does not want the checks and balances that the states give. It does not like local government as it presently is, because it is that sphere of government closest to the people and that is part of its long-term aim. I support local government as it stands. I support the states. Local government does a tremendous job. It is pleasing to see that, with Senator Tambling's urging, at last the government has picked up the amendments we have proposed, which are simply putting into effect the agreements that the Labor Party had made with local government but had tried to get around.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pity that the government has waited to debate this Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995 until everyone is in a state of total exhaustion. It is very poor planning from a legislative and accountability perspective, although it might be clever if the objective is to sneak things through. I am certain that it will not get the debate it deserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) have always had a strong interest in local government. We have indicated that we have concerns that federal grants should be distributed equitably, that needs arising from the specific situations of councils should be recognised, and that local governments should use the grants in ways that are accountable to each local community. This bill seeks to address several of these issues, and that is a good thing. The reporting requirements are a good thing, especially the ministerial report to parliament. However, it is strange that there is a requirement to report to federal parliament but not to report to the council of local government ministers or to local governments themselves. I am sure that it is the intention of parliament and the minister that they should get copies, and I thought we should say so. I have indicated this in an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this bill will probably not get the debate it deserves and has probably not had the attention and scrutiny it deserves. I think this is because it is basically a measure to assure some distributive equity for local government grants. However, while I salute the purpose as far as I can determine it, I have a few reservations and I have raised them with the minister and the department. I think there are some problems with the method by which the objectives are sought. The new arrangement this bill introduces seems a bit top down to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, I would like to mention that last night the duty minister, Senator Crowley, sniped at me on behalf of the advisers. The snipe was: `Why did you not tell us what your problems were?' I was really tired at that stage and I did not come back originally. I now clearly recall that in that meeting it was mentioned to us that there would be such things as benchmarking by the state and federal governments together on such things as waste management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the advisers remember that. We mentioned our horror in regard to areas like waste management, which are about as far away from the gambit of state and federal governments as it is possible to get. If there is anything that local governments have the expertise in, it is waste management. The suggestion was that state and federal governments get together on benchmarking for these kinds of areas. Perhaps the advisers who felt it necessary to get the minister to snipe at me&mdash;or perhaps she did it on her own volition&mdash;might remember those serious concerns and might get back in their advisers box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement to report is all upward, to the federal level. In some sense, this bill overrides state government. That, in itself, is not a problem where it is in the interest of local government. I have no illusions that state governments are responsive and decentralist bodies. They are not. They are often worse and more centralist than federal government, and I think this bill seeks to overcome state decisions that occur at the expense of equity between local areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, for the perspective of the Greens (WA), we would like to have a much more democratic process embodied here. We would like to see a lot more of the power explicitly put in the collective hands of local government. I am not naive enough to think that local government always acts in the best interests of the community or the environment, but I do think that, when it comes together collectively, it can come up with relatively fair and equitable criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern that I have is that, in clause 6, the principles governing allocation of grants is decided by the federal minister. He or she is supposed to consult the state ministers. There is nothing here about consulting local government or its representative bodies. This is a very top-down situation akin to the way the boundaries of regional economic development organisations in Western Australia were decided. This occurred in a meeting between federal and state ministers without reference to the community, local government or existing regional development organisations. This is regional based development&mdash;I bet!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, we have put forward another amendment to state that not only should the federal minister consult with local government but also the minister should actively seek the assistance of local government in formulating the national principles. Now, if it is about local government, I should darn well think so! National principles concerning local government should not be made by a cabal of ministers with ultimate autonomous power resting with the federal minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the coalition has also recognised some of the problem, particularly the problem of parliament setting up autonomous instrumentalities to wield federal power over state and local government without needing to refer to federal parliament. Originally, the coalition had proposed an amendment to ensure that this would happen, that instruments affecting the federal policy should be tabled in parliament, that any revocation or variation of such instruments made by the minister should also come before parliament and that such instruments should be disallowable by parliament. I note this is no longer listed as a coalition amendment. The government has put it up. I hope this is a sign of government recognition of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) have no difficulty with this amendment, as it is likely that only a measure that seemed contrary to the interests of local government would be disallowed. I may be wrong about the parliament on that, but I hope not. The Greens (WA) will support this amendment, but wonder that Senator Tambling had no similar worries about the competition policy bill, which creates even more centralised executive power. Under clause 7 of the competition principles agreement, the parties agreed to apply the agreement to local government. The opposition knocked back our amendment that would have assured some consideration by the competition minister, or competition commission of any state-federal or state-federal-local agreement relating to local government funding. In fact, the opposition supported government amendments to explicitly exclude any considerations of such amendments. So, we might look after local government in relation to the minister for regional development, but that minister is always more likely to be receptive to local government than the competition commission and its minister, and that commission and minister have been given the power to trample on this agreement and whatever the parliament does in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That outlines our concerns. Basically, the bill is reasonable in its objectives, but it should have and could have embodied real participation and powers of determination with local governments themselves. It does not, and instead, we have one of those peculiar autonomous organisations, with quasi-legislative powers, which seeks to redefine the relationship of the three tiers of government. It is a far better organisation than some of the others&mdash;for instance, the competition commission&mdash;but it is still a top-down organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have therefore put up three amendments&mdash;and will support those of the government&mdash;which were put by the opposition in the House of Representatives. Our first amendment would ensure that the minister, in making principles to follow, would have to actively engage local government. The second would include environmental considerations in the reports. This recognises the crucial role and high degree of expertise that many local government agencies have on environmental issues and the crucial role they play in sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say here that local government handles waste, recycling, zoning and often sewerage and other such issues. Whilst some councils may do a poor job, collectively local government is often way out in front of other tiers of government on waste management, water management and other areas of natural resource management. It is the level of government that sees the problem and usually the one that has direct responsibility to act. Our third amendment addresses concerns of local government that it should also receive a copy of the report that is tabled in federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, before any minister or acting minister snipes at the Greens about our ability to produce amendments earlier, I would like to point out that all of the budget bills and all of the other bills in this parliament are being handled for the Greens by two senators with very small staff. So before the government starts sniping about our ability to get amendments to it quickly, it should work out first of all when its amendments come to us and what resources two senators are expected to apply in order to act exactly like government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me, as the spokesperson for the shadow minister for Commonwealth-state relations, to speak on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995. I endorse the remarks that my colleagues have made regarding local government. As we all would know, this bill replaces the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986, under which existing financial assistance grants, known as FAGs, are made to local government. In 1995-96, FAGs to councils will total $1.165 billion, comprising $807.2 million in general purpose grants and $358.1 million in funding which, while nominally identified as local road funding, is untied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has a longstanding record in relation to its support for local government. We believe that local government must be treated as the vital third tier of government which it is. My colleague Senator Ian Macdonald has already identified quite a number of my colleagues on this side that have had local government experience. I too had a fair amount of experience in local government before I came to this place. The commitment that the coalition has stands in stark contrast to the record of the Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the federal general purpose grants for local government councils in 1995-96 will be three per cent less in real terms than when the Labor party come to office. When I was the warden of the then Clarence municipality, now known as Clarence City, we experienced at first hand the different funding ways the government used to fund councils. At the end of the day, in most cases, in real terms we used to get funding cuts. This was so right across Australia and the 1995-96 general purpose grants to the local councils will be three per cent less in real terms than when Labor came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this in itself is bad enough, the hypocrisy of Labor senators who come into this place and pretend to champion local government is further demonstrated by the fact that this government, in the time in which it has reduced funding to local government in real terms by three per cent, has raised total tax revenues by a staggering 49 per cent. Although the government has foreshadowed that it intends maintaining a real terms per capita funding level commencing in 1997-98, such a move is long overdue and mirrors the position which the coalition has repeatedly taken ever since this Labor government assumed office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, anyone who has watched this government's neglect of local government cannot help being very concerned by the fact that the government is not prepared to enshrine such a commitment in the bill. Knowing this government as we all do, I have not the slightest doubt that, if it does not suit the Labor Party at the time, the Labor Party is quite capable of changing its mind. We have only to cast our minds back to the tax cuts promised before the last election, which were supposed to be enshrined in l-a-w law but ended up being one big l-i-e. No doubt, this aspect would be worthy of debate as an amendment if it were not for the fact that we will obviously have a coalition at the time, which will no doubt honour any commitments which it makes to local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received a number of representations on this bill from local government in Tasmania. One of the principal concerns which was put to me was that this bill did not require the federal government to consult with local councils before deciding the formula by which federal local road funds would be allocated between local councils. Understandably, councils were angry that the government had failed to give them input into the new distribution arrangements which could lead to major changes in the allocation of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This position adopted by the government was also clearly at odds with the agreements which were reached at conferences of local government ministers in October 1994 and April 1995. What had been agreed was that any new national principles would be formulated in consultation with state ministers and with the ALGA. It took the coalition to remind the government of this previous undertaking. I am glad that the government eventually saw fit to adopt our amendments in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What remains a concern is that the government has until now refused to ensure that the funding distribution is subject to full accountability before the parliament. As a result, we were left with legislation where it was possible for the minister to vary the principles on a whim. The coalition has always maintained that this is not good enough and I am sure that local government considers that this is not good enough also. Although we now have an amendment which at long last is to be included by the government, I am sure that local government will remember that it had to bring the Labor government to this final position kicking and screaming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential during the debate on this bill that we also acknowledge that section 16(2)(c) goes far beyond what was agreed to in relation to reporting requirements. Once again we have the government breaking an undertaking which quite obviously local government believes was made to it previously by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I would like to quote from a letter which I received from Sue Smith who is the President of the Local Government Association of Tasmania. It is in a very similar vein to a letter that my colleague Senator Panizza quoted from the Local Government Association of Western Australia. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State Ministers and ALGA took the view that reporting on the performance of Councils should be to the Local Government Ministers Conference, not Parliament. There has been no agreement as yet on the form which such reports should take, and the issue is to be subject of further investigation by officials and advice to Ministers next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the bill are therefore at best premature.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, the government has broken a firm commitment to local government. I only hope that this is the last commitment that this government is able to break with local government before it is removed from office by the ratepayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government has also identified significant problems in relation to the objects clause as it relates to council efficiency. It is felt that&mdash;and I would certainly agree, if the purpose of these grants is to improve the capacity of councils to provide their services to ratepayers in a more equitable manner&mdash;decisions as to how these funds are to be spent must remain a matter for each individual council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a matter of further concern that, at the Local Government Ministers Conference in April this year, it was agreed that arrangements would be put in place to ensure that the states and territories, state local government associations and the Commonwealth would work together towards providing council services to Aboriginal communities. I remember Senator Tambling commenting on this yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government had an agreement with the government which it considered was both equitable and reasonable; however, the government either has a bad memory or it has simply chosen to throw an undertaking out the window. Let me again quote from the letter I had from the President of the Local Government Association of Tasmania. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of ATSIC communities, it was agreed that one of the national principles would refer to their particular needs. To go further and make the improvement of services a specific object of the Bill can only raise unsustainable expectations that such improvements will occur. This is a dangerous and potentially divisive course of action, especially given that the Bill does not and cannot provide any special funding for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our underlying concern is that once this Act refers to one particular group with special needs, others will inevitably seek similar treatment. Local Government has broad social justice responsibilities and it is wrong to focus so strongly on just one section of the population, albeit arguably the most disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA>What the government has failed to appreciate is that the problems faced by our Aboriginal communities require a combined approach rather than an isolated approach. What I fear, and no doubt what concerns local government, is that what the Labor government is attempting to do is to embroil local government in attempting to resolve the failings of the federal government in providing adequate services for those who live in Aboriginal communities. Should this occur, we will have a situation in which local government is forced to assume far too great a responsibility for what is essentially a federal Labor government failing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that local government associations from around the country wrote to the minister seeking amendments to address these concerns; but obviously, and not surprisingly, these representations fell on deaf ears. This is a government which likes to pretend that it has a genuine interest in local government but, looking at the facts and the manner in which its representations are ignored or only included reluctantly at the last minute, we can see that we have a government which only pays lip-service to the genuine concerns of local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the resignation of former Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe will further downgrade the level of recognition afforded local government by the Labor Party. But there is light at the end of the tunnel, Mr Acting Deputy President. That light comes in the form of the forthcoming election, when I am sure the coalition will take over the Treasury benches and will give local government the fair go it has been looking for for quite some time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill and the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) would enact a series of amendments to a number of transport related acts. The first bill would amend ten acts, including the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act, the Federal Airports Corporation Act and the Motor Vehicle Standards Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) would implement a number of important changes to the Air Navigation Act relating to aviation safety. The bill would insert a new part dealing with aviation safety issues into the act. The new part would be largely the same as part XVIA of the Air Navigation Regulations but would impose penalties that were more in line with the gravity of aviation security offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important sections of the two bills are those that would implement the government's undertaking to reform the liability and insurance arrangements that apply to air operators. I am talking about the air operators' liability for the passengers that they carry and the responsibility they bear for compensation in the event of death or injury to the passengers. The personal injury liability of air carriers is set out in the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959. The act implements a series of international agreements that are known collectively as the Warsaw Convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Warsaw Convention was signed in 1929, when aviation was very much in its infancy. The state-of-the-art aircraft in 1929 was the Lockheed Vega, an aircraft that carried only six passengers and a pilot. But it was still apparent that international air travel would increase dramatically. With this predicted increase in air travel loomed the possibility of increased airline crashes. There were concerns that if an aeroplane did crash, there would be no limit on liability and the large damages claims could wipe out the airline concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the Warsaw Convention was drafted to impose a degree of uniformity on international aviation law. The most important sections of the Warsaw Convention are those that regulate civil aviation carrier liability. Article 17 provides that a carrier is liable for damages with respect to passenger death or injury. Carriers are liable if the accident took place on board an aircraft or in the course of boarding, embarkation or disembarkation. Article 22 limits a carriers' liability to 125,000 Poincare gold francs for each passenger except where there is a different contract existing between the parties. The Poincare gold franc was a world currency standard that ceased to exist in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a trade-off in the Warsaw Convention regarding aviation liability. The limit on a carriers' liability does not apply if the damage results from his or her wilful misconduct. This, and other articles, were changed by the Hague protocol of 1955. The 1955 Hague protocol amended the Warsaw Convention and entered into force on 1 August 1963. The protocol doubled the liability limit to 250,000 gold francs and tightened the conditions under which carriers could be held absolutely liable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a further attempt to amend the liability limits in the Montreal protocols, which were debated in the 1970s. The Montreal protocols were deemed necessary due to the inflation of the 1970s and the demise of the gold standard. The Montreal protocols proposed to limit the carriers' liability to 100,000 special drawing rights. The Montreal protocols proposed to lift the international liability ceiling to $US75,000, but the protocols would have made that ceiling unbreakable. Accident victims could not recover more than the limit, even if the airline was guilty of wilful misconduct. Instead, passengers could fund their compensation by paying a surcharge on their airline tickets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unbreakable ceiling and the funding shift from airlines to passengers became the stumbling blocks to approval of the Montreal protocols. The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill would increase the liability of domestic carriers to a minimum of $500,000 per passenger. It would increase the liability of Australian international carriers to a minimum of 260,000 SDRs per passenger, and 260,000 SDRs is approximately $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what about foreign international carriers serving Australia? Australia cannot impose its own liability regime on airlines that are based in countries that are signatories to the Warsaw Convention. I understand the government has asked them to increase their limits voluntarily, but it cannot require them to do so. However, the government can use some coercion and does have some weapons. One of them is the mandatory insurance requirement that would be enacted in the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which I will discuss shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's other weapon is the threat of notice requirements for foreign carriers which do not raise their liability limits. That would mean on flights to or from Australia such carriers could be made to notify passengers that the limits are lower. Essentially, the notification would state, `If we crash, your life is worth less than if you were flying Qantas or Ansett,' or any other airline that had agreed to the limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) would insert a new part into the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Act which could require all carriers, including foreign carriers, to hold personal injury liability insurance of at least $500,000 for a domestic carrier, or 260,000 SDRs for any other carrier, such as an Australian international carrier or a foreign carrier. To be acceptable under the bill, an insurance contract would have to provide that the insurance company's liability was not affected by any breach of safety related requirements by the carrier or by its financial position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a few complaints from some small carriers who complained, firstly, that they were having difficulty getting coverage by the underwriters and, secondly, that they were concerned about the fact that the premiums would go up. On both occasions I have been satisfied by the responses I got. The first one was that when the liability increased last year to $500,000 premiums went up. Underwriters have advised me they do not expect the premiums to go up further because of the requirement that insurance covers would be paid irrespective of any breaches of safety. Carriers would be prohibited from carrying passengers unless they have suitable insurance cover. The penalty for a breach of the act would be up to two years imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposed changes to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act come about as a result of a tragic air accident that occurred outside Young on a dark night in June 1993. On 11 June 1993 a Monarch Piper Chieftain aeroplane slammed into a rocky hill near the Young aerodrome. All of the seven people aboard were killed, although one passenger, a little girl, survived with shocking injuries for another 10 hours. The investigation into the Monarch crash revealed the inadequacies of the arrangements regarding aviation liability and insurance. It became very obvious that our arrangements regarding carrier liability insurance were not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act significantly increase the maximum payout that would be given to the victim of an air crash or to his or her family. Nonetheless, there is still a degree of inequity in the system. People who are involved in land accidents often receive huge compensation payouts. People who are made paraplegics as a result of accidents have received several million dollars in compensation. A recent example of such a case was when an Australian man who was a cancer victim was made a paraplegic because of a needle being incorrectly injected. That man received a record $6 million in compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people argue that we should abandon the framework of the Warsaw Convention and move towards an unlimited liability regime and that such a system would be much fairer for the victims of air accidents. But the Warsaw Convention framework benefits the travelling public as well as the airlines. In the event of an air accident, the passengers or their families do not have to prove fault on the part of the carrier. That is the key part of the legislation. What is more, the multilateral system eliminates many jurisdictional difficulties. It also means that payments would be made in a much quicker way than under the existing system where legal cases can go on year after year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to strike a balance between the need to adequately compensate the victims of air accidents and the need for Australia to remain firmly within the Warsaw Convention regime. The modifications to the carriers liability system have resulted in a substantial increase in insurance premiums paid by the carriers. The $180,000 liability limit that applied until last year was entirely unacceptable. It was an insult to the pain and terror experienced by people involved in air accidents, such as the seven people who died on that rocky hillside near Young on a dark night in June. The coalition supports the bills. </PARA>

This I found to be frustrating, but I find that what Senator Patterson is proposing today is anything but a frustration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Public Service (Abolition of Compulsory Retirement Age) Amendment Bill 1995 I will be brief, because I know Senator Patterson will want to make some closing remarks. The government does not oppose the removal of compulsory age retirement in the APS, but the government believes that any change needs to be sensitively managed, especially in the context of the potential additional cost of workers compensation if the retirement age is removed. The government does not, therefore, support the private member's bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering this issue, the government believes the following points need to be borne in mind. Although the Public Service Act retires APS staff at the age of 65, departmental secretaries do have the discretion to retain the services of staff beyond this age if this is in the interests of the service. The number of staff affected also needs to be kept in perspective. Less than two per cent of public servants continue to work past the age of 60 and, as at June 1994, only about 300 people out of 143,000 were still in the APS work force at the age of 64. Thus the evidence suggests that most public servants choose to retire before reaching maximum retirement age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential cost impact of removing the retirement age could, however, be enormous, particularly in relation to workers compensation. If the compulsory retirement age is removed, it is possible that a long-term compensation claimant could be compensated not just until the age of 65 but forever. The cost of this could run into tens of millions of dollars. The government is, however, considering options for the design of workers compensation arrangements so that the compulsory retirement age issue can be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;This has to be one of the most disappointing days in this parliament. The government has had innumerable opportunities to lift the compulsory retirement age for public servants. A similar bill was brought into this house by me, and a similar bill was brought into the House of Representatives by Mr Connolly, during the last parliament, nearly three years ago. The same old tawdry, tired arguments were brought up then by the government, that it could not afford the workers compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had wanted to do it, it would have found a way. Where there is a will there is a way. There is no will on the part of this government to enable those people in the Public Service who are still capable, who are still able and who still wish to, to continue working beyond the age of 65. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only the other day one of the attendants in this building said to me, `You have got 18 months, Senator, to get this bill through, because I want to keep working. I am fit, I am well and I would like to keep working.' He is one of that two per cent over 60 who wants to keep working. That is not so for everyone&mdash;of course not for everyone. It goes against the government's argument to say that only two per cent of people in the Public Service are over 60. In fact, it reduces the government's argument almost to nothing. Of course there are not hordes of people in the Public Service who want to stay on beyond 65, but there are some who wish to, who are capable and who should be able to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the states have found it possible to adjust their legislation to enable people in their Public Service departments to work beyond 65 and they cope with the compensation. The federal government is unable to address the compensation issue. It cannot organise itself at a federal level when, in fact, many of the states have been able to do it. This is a most disappointing response from the government. It has had three years to address the issue. It knew it was coming up; it came up with the same argument last time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the Democrats' support for this bill. We will introduce this bill over and over again. I hope the Australian public is aware that this government says that 65-year-old people have reached their use-by date; it chooses to put these people on the shelf as worthless. The government would rather have these people on the pension than working and contributing to Australia. This government is saying to those people who want to stay on, `Go on the pension or take out superannuation, if there is any.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these people, if they have been in the Public Service for a short while, may have to be on a part pension. The government is saying to them, `Go on the public purse; don't make a contribution; we don't need you; you have passed your use-by date.' The message from this government to every person over 65 is: you are useless; the government does not need you; you have nothing to contribute. That is the message that the government has given today not only to all public servants but also to all Australians. It is reflected in its attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the minister the other day: what is the government doing about counteracting ageism in the Australian society? She could not answer me; she had to get a brief. When she came back with the answer a week later, it was hopeless. There was nothing about what the government was doing to counteract ageism in advertising; there was nothing about counteracting ageism in the work force; there was nothing to counteract advertising in government literature; there was nothing to counteract ageism in children's literature. If it had been an issue about indigenous people or an issue about homosexuals, the government would have been making an effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People over 65 have passed their use-by date; they are not worth anything to this government. The treatment of pensioners and the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares is another example of the government's attitude to older Australians. Time after time this government keeps demonstrating to us and to the Australian community its attitude to older Australians. It was demonstrated by its previous leader Mr Hawke, when he called a pensioner a `silly old bugger', and this attitude is demonstrated in the way the government deals with legislation. The government has opposed this private member's bill. It is a very sad day. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

I ask: why did you claim in the Senate on Monday that General Mantiri's remarks of July 1992 that the Dili massacre was `quite proper' was a single response and that there is nothing to suggest that they represent a more substantial position than he has adopted, when he had, in fact, repeated those comments almost a full year later in May of 1993, when he again described the actions of the Indonesian military in East Timor as `quite proper'? Secondly, I repeat my question of yesterday. What action did you personally take to raise the insensitivity of the general's appointment as Indonesia's Australian ambassador before the formal decision to seek his approval was made?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Downer, as quoted in one newspaper story this morning, seems to be believing that the government response is quite on target so far as this particular matter is concerned, for which, of course, I am pathetically grateful, given Mr Downer's inability hitherto to adopt a bipartisan position on anything in recent weeks. It is interesting to see that others in the opposition still seem to think there is some political mileage from making even more difficult in the national interest an issue which is already of some difficulty and sensitivity, as I have been at pains to point out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I referred on Monday, as I think it was, to the article in 1992, that was the information that was before me and that was my recollection, that there was only one substantial breach. Certainly, that was the only one that had been drawn to my attention in a way that produced the response that I have described, that is to say, to go back to Indonesia, as we did at the time, and to express our deep regret about the fact that the remarks were made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that they may have been made at some later stage does not alter the basic nub of the answer I gave. It was given inadvertently. To the extent that it may have been repeated, that is again unfortunate, but it does not alter the nub of what I was saying. And to the extent that there is any explanation in cultural terms of the kind that I gave, well, then, it is equally applicable to the second expression as it was to the first. As I also drew attention to later in the week, there was a second, a further, journal interview given by General Mantiri earlier this year in which he was at pains to acknowledge that there were some&mdash;I have not got the quote in front of me&mdash;bad elements within the Indonesian military and that that fact ought to be acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have someone who, as I said, has a reputation for competence, who has a reputation for personability, who has a reputation for a strong knowledge of Australia, who has a reputation for being a reformer within the Indonesian system and who was clearly the choice of the Indonesian president. The choice of that particular person, from all points of view, would be an admirable one were it not for this very considerable blot on the record. That blot demands some attention; otherwise it will obviously be the case that there will be a considerable degree of ongoing discomfort and embarrassment for the Indonesian government in Australia. That is something that is much to be avoided, if it possibly can be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to my own role in all of this, I did have discussions in the latter part of last year about the impending appointment, during the course of which some markers were laid down. There were subsequent direct exchanges on the subject between officials here in Canberra and also in Jakarta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go any further into the details of those exchanges, but they were certainly sufficient to signal the Australian government's concern about the implications of this appointment, although, I repeat, General Mantiri is, apart from this, very highly respected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. The United States and Japan have announced that they have reached an agreement relating to automotive trade. In the past you have expressed concerns that any agreement should not disadvantage the Australian automotive industry, and specifically Australia's export of components to Japan. Can you, therefore, advise of the implications of the agreement for the Australian automotive industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2142" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian government welcomes the settlement of the automobile dispute. In principle, it seems to have been a satisfactory settlement, particularly as an alternative to the prospect of unilateral retaliation. The dispute covered three areas: replacement parts market, dealerships in Japan for new automobiles and original equipment parts. The Australian interest has always been mainly in the outcome in the area of original equipment parts, for which Australia is a very big supplier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at this outcome as more than merely the avoidance of a serious problem, which it is, but as the creation of a significant opportunity because the plans that we were advised the five Japanese automobile companies would release would propose the increased purchase of foreign parts for production of autos in Japan, to the value of about $6 billion. This creates a window of opportunity for the Australian automobile parts manufacturers. We already have a significant share of that market. We export a lot of automobile components to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have consistently sought to ensure that the outcome of this matter was not discriminatory against third party interests, of course Australia's interests in particular; but not just for the proper and obvious priority that it defends the interests of our industry, but for the broader interest that it defends the multilateral trading rules which are very important to a free trading country like Australia. That was why we exercised our so-called third party rights. We participated in the World Trade Organisations consultations and made a small increment of contribution to the process and certainly put ourselves in a good position to defend Australia's interests as the further detail of this issue unravelled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of our concern that any outcome might be discriminatory, we very much welcome the comment by Mr Hashimoto, made at the joint press conference with USTR Kantor, `I would like to assure you on this occasion that all the agreements between the two countries is applicable to all the trading partners we have on a MFN basis.' That is a very important statement by Minister Hashimoto. We have been told confidentially by both the United States and Japan that the deal will be MFN and the outcome does not and will not disadvantage Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the industry in Australia will be examining closely the fine print of the agreement to make sure there is nothing in the detail or in its implementation that might disadvantage Australia, because there is a downside and a potential benefit to Australia which we wish to make sure we do not miss out on. Australia has put itself in a strong legal position because of the initiatives we have taken. If anything should arise which causes us concern, we are very well placed to take the opportunity to pursue our interests in the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian industry has given us its initial assessment of the agreement. It is welcomed. Both the Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers referred to the potential pluses and the need to keep a close watch on these matters. I am delighted to say the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers also correctly expressed its support for the prominent role Australia had played in it. Together with my colleague Senator Cook, who is going to Japan on a matter which particularly relates to this&mdash;and I will subsequently be doing the same in Washington&mdash;I will be keeping in close contact with the industry as the agreement unfolds.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Can the minister inform the Senate of the expected impact on national savings of the superannuation measures announced in the budget? Could the minister also detail the expected impact of these measures on the current account?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2144" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Burns for his question. I know that he has had a long interest in superannuation. Senators are aware that this year's budget is aimed squarely at boosting the level of national savings in Australia. In the short term, national savings are boosted by a return of the budget to surplus, with surpluses not only this year but in the out years&mdash;next financial year and the financial year after that. Over the medium term, the government's latest superannuation initiative, Saving for our Future, will have a substantial impact on national savings as well as providing Australians with higher standards of living in their retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983, the government and the ACTU have cooperated, in what is an historic partnership, to transform superannuation from a privileged form of tax advantage saving, mainly by the higher paid, to an almost universal entitlement for working men and women in this country. It is therefore fitting that the Saving for our Future program has been endorsed as part of Accord Mark VIII announced last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures announced in Saving for our Future are expected to add around one per cent of GDP to national savings by the middle of the next decade, rising to 1.7 per cent of GDP by the year 2020. Combined with the government's earlier award and superannuation guarantee initiatives, the new measures are expected to increase national savings by two per cent of GDP by the year 2000, growing to four per cent of GDP by 2020. In today's dollars, that is equivalent to an extra $9 billion of saving each year by 2000, growing to around $18 billion of additional savings by the year 2020.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the beginning of the 1980s, the current account deficit, which reflects the gap between national savings and investment, has averaged 4 1/2 per cent of GDP. The boost to national savings coming from the government's superannuation initiatives will therefore be instrumental in bridging the gap between national savings and investment. In turn, this will see a substantial reduction in the current account deficit over the medium to the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, in its most recent review of Australia, Moody's, the international credit rating organisation, endorsed the government's strategy of boosting national savings in order to reduce Australia's reliance on foreign capital without destructive cuts to investment. I would like to quote what Moody's said in extolling the strengths of our policy direction. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The higher the level of savings, the more remains for investment. The higher the level of investment, the greater the potential for future economic growth. In Australia's case there is an added benefit. Since Australia has traditionally relied heavily on foreign savings to fund an important portion of its domestic investment, a higher level of national savings will help satisfy the demand for investment funds which otherwise would have to have come from foreign sources. Higher national savings translates into less foreign borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>The superannuation initiative that we have supported for the length of our term in government, and which is encoded again in this budget, will produce major structural change in Australia's national savings performance. It will produce retirement incomes with dignity for working Australians, both men and women. It is part of the visionary agenda, opposed at every point by the opposition, that we have put together brick by brick to lift the retirement standards of living of Australians as well as to develop a major pool of national savings from which we can draw investment in developing Australian industry and Australian competitiveness in the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that happened, the impact on national savings would be very significant&mdash;a reduction of around 2 1/4 per cent of GDP by the year 2003, which is $11 billion less in savings in today's dollars. The impact on the stock of superannuation savings would be particularly severe: by 2003, just eight years away, about $45 billion of superannuation savings would be lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individuals earning average weekly earnings and working for a large employer would stand to lose 62 per cent of their superannuation entitlement&mdash;that is a loss of $288,000 to an individual in today's dollars. The loss of retirement benefits for a similar individual working for a small employer would be 69 per cent, or $318,500 in today's dollars. I am talking about the opposition's proposals on superannuation. If those proposals came into being, workers would be worse off, according to the employers they work for, by between 64 per cent and 69 per cent of their retirement incomes. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. What contracts do Australian uranium mining companies have with the French government-owned nuclear cycle company Cogema or with Saarberg Interuran or Urangesselschaft, both substantially owned by Cogema, or with EDF? What are the quantities involved, and when were the contracts entered into? At the time these contracts were entered into did they contravene ALP policy, and do they now contravene ALP policy? If not, why not? Finally, how much Australian uranium is enriched in Cogema's plant for both France and other countries, and is the same plant used for the enrichment of weapons-grade uranium?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2145" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the first part of Senator Coulter's question, the precise details of the contracts are commercial-in-confidence between the company, of course, as the supplier and its customer. Senator Coulter may wish to take that matter up directly with the company. It is well known in the industry, and it has appeared in print just recently, that ERA is supplying quite a small amount of uranium&mdash;I think around 270 or 300 tonnes a year&mdash;and it is also well known, because these are long-term contracts, that the French are currently paying 50 to 60 per cent above the world spot price for that product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company is in fact ERA. WMC does not sell uranium to France. I understand, however, that ERA sells to EDF, which of course is the government-owned generating authority in France, the French producing about 70 per cent of their entire electricity supply by nuclear energy. To put that in context, from memory I think the total demand in the French system is for around 11,000 tonnes of this product per year. The contracts are with EDF, not Cogema or its affiliates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second part of the question, I wish to emphasise that exports of Australian uranium to France are actually restricted under current government policy because of the French nuclear testing, which seems to have been lost in the debate. No new contracts have been permitted since February 1988 and, under the current policy, none will be until France permanently ceases testing and becomes a party to the comprehensive test ban treaty. That is the reason the restrictions were introduced&mdash;because of the French tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current contracts with France were negotiated in 1987. Because of this policy, Australian exports of uranium to France supply, as I have just indicated, something less than three per cent of France's uranium requirements for nuclear power generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the third part of the question, Australian uranium exports to France, as with all other markets, are subject to stringent and effective safeguard arrangements, including coverage by the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, to ensure the uranium is only used for peaceful purposes. Exports to France are governed by the provisions of the bilateral agreement concerning nuclear transfers between Australia and France which entered into force in September 1981. The Australian Safeguards Office administers an accounting system which follows the precise quantities of uranium from the time it is packed for export to the time it is stored as nuclear waste to ensure that there is no diversion from the civil nuclear power generation program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by restating what this government has said again and again. The decision by the French government to resume testing is a bad decision. It is a bad decision because it completely ignores the views of the people of the South Pacific and because it sets back the cause of French participation in this region of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. There is just one part of the question the minister did not answer. Is it a fact that the Cogema plant, which is used to enrich uranium, is used also to enrich Australian uranium for other countries, so the amount of Australian uranium passing through that plant is much more than the three per cent? Secondly, is not this the same plant which is used to enrich uranium for weapons?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I thought that was well known. I am sure Senator Coulter will acknowledge that it is well known. It is an old argument. It gets back to whether you accept this policy of equivalence or not. Senator Coulter clearly does not. He has said that over the years and he is entitled to say it in here. My understanding is that, in terms of the actual atoms coming from a particular place, it is all relevant to the total world supply of uranium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This argument would be relevant if uranium was the rare metal that it was once thought to be. But it is not. Particularly since the break-up of the Soviet Union it is in abundant supply around the world. It is a fact that if we suspended uranium sales to France&mdash;and they are currently restricted because of the French testing program, and have been since the time I indicated&mdash;it would simply give the French government a let-off that it would otherwise not get and allow it to purchase this uranium for about 40 per cent of the price that it is currently paying for it.</PARA>

What is the value of contracts between the French company Thomson Sintra Pacific Pty Ltd and the ADF for the provision of sonars for the Collins class submarine and Anzac frigate projects, and what other large contracts is the minister aware of involving the ADF and French companies? Given that the government's response to French nuclear testing has involved only the freezing of defence contracts with French companies at existing levels, why did the government not undertake a comprehensive review of contracts involving French companies and consider the cancellation of existing contracts, which would have sent a much stronger message to the French government which has a financial interest in many of these companies? Why is the minister so keen to defend French defence industry interests in this regard?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2147" SPEAKER="Ray Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts's mention in her question of the freezing of defence contracts is a misreading of anything that I have put out. It was `contacts' not `contracts'. Nevertheless, I will move on to the substance of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts asks about Thomson Sintra's contracts on sonar. They are not contracts with the Australian government. In the case of submarines, the company has a contract with Rockwells, which in turn has a contract with Australian Submarine Corporation. That is a commercial arrangement between those companies and not with the government. In the case of the frigates, it is a contract between Thomson Sintra and Transfield Defence Systems, and again that is not a direct contract with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts asked why we do not cancel current defence contracts with French firms. There are a variety of reasons not to do so. The first reason is that we would thereby be found in any court, I think, in breach of contract and litigated against. It would therefore mean that we would be paying French firms money for work that they did not even do. I cannot really understand what sort of punishment that would be to France.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Margetts has used Thomson Sintra as a classic example. Thomson Sintra has set up an Australian subsidiary. As a result, the net effect of cancelling contracts would mean that Australians working for those companies in Australia would be put out of work. Again, that does not seem to be a direct punishment of France, but of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, these firms are engaged under contract to supply equipment to larger projects. Cancelling the contracts in that regard would mean that those projects could not go ahead until replacement suppliers had been found. That would put Australian defence projects back by some months&mdash;in some cases years&mdash;and that again punishes Australia and not France.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, by taking French firms out of these contracts we would allow other companies from other countries to make bids at extravagant prices because they have no competition. The two areas where we have reservations in regard to defence contracts of equipment nature with France are: firstly, any direct procurement deal with the French government is suspended for the entire duration of the tests; and secondly, where any French firm is a prime, it has to be referred to me on a case by case basis. The reason for that is that it is not always easy to establish who is the prime. Let us take the example of the Eurocopter, which is a French-German-Italian helicopter. Who is the prime in that case? I would have to investigate that and make a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last part of Senator Margetts's question asked why I was so keen to defend these contracts. I have shown no keenness at all to defend them. That is in Senator Margetts's mind and imagination. What my department has done in terms of the cabinet submission and the announcement made last Friday morning is more than every other department put together. We have totally changed our defence relationship with France. We have banned ship visits, we have banned plane visits, we have banned bilateral exercises, and we have banned senior officers' visits. We have not recalled our defence attache for consultation; we have recalled him full stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a whole range of areas we have taken effective bilateral action against our defence relationship with France, and we have done it in such a way as to target those measures so that it is France, if possible, that bears the burden of it, not our Pacific island neighbours and not our own defence forces. The only exception we have made on plane visits is medivac and search and rescue, which I do not think anyone in this chamber would dispute we should stay involved in. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The minister mentioned that there are private companies involved that are not necessarily directly involved with the French government. In reality, in Australia we have been moving towards private and semi-private arms procurement and defence procurement. Does that mean that any statement that Australia makes in relation to government policy for our defence procurement does not apply if private companies are involved? Where do you then put Australian Defence Industries? Do we say, `That is a government business enterprise and not government' or is it government when it is sold off?

Secondly, where a French company is the prime that has the overall responsibility for the contract, that will be on a case by case basis with myself.

Minister, last Thursday in answering my question relating to the reduction in funding for the emergency relief program, you indicated that the government was funding a study by ACOSS to determine `who the people are that are using emergency relief'. I ask: is the minister aware of a 1992 government funded study conducted by the Salvation Army into emergency relief, part of which detailed the people who are using emergency relief? Is the minister aware that this study showed that less than 50 per cent of people requesting emergency relief were unemployed? Why does the government need to fund another study when such data is already available?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that it is important we get national data across a number of agencies&mdash;in fact, across as many agencies as we can&mdash;that are providing assistance and emergency relief for people. It does not change, as much as I can tell, the terms of reference that we have set for this piece of research. In particular, we want to be sure, for example, not just who is getting emergency relief but whether those people come back again and again and what might be the reasons that are encouraging people to go through the emergency relief route into support rather than through the system of social security payments, let alone any state assistance that they might get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Woodley raises is essentially a matter of continuing concern about the people in our community who make use of emergency relief. The evidence from the people who provide that relief is that there is still a considerable level of concern in the community. Certainly, that is a matter of concern for me. But as the formula for that funding, as I said last time, is based in part on the number of unemployed people and those numbers have fallen dramatically, so has our allocation for emergency relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is still very important that we assist people through emergency relief to get into our mainstream assistance, to get to where family payments, support on behalf of children, ongoing income support and back-up are provided for them in an ongoing way, so that fewer and fewer families need to depend on emergency relief. I will note your point, Senator. I am certainly pursuing it and you can be assured of my concern about this matter.

All we have is the opposition's record. When this government came into office, the Liberal Party had committed less than $15 million to sport in this country. It is now over $140 million. We have a great record. The opposition has no policies, and everyone in the Australian sports community knows it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for her question. This, as many senators know, is a year of 50th anniversaries. One of the anniversaries that may have been overlooked&mdash;and I am pleased to announce it publicly today&mdash;is the 50th anniversary of the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act 1944, the 50th anniversary of the Commonwealth unemployment benefits that came into effect in July 1945.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be marking this anniversary in the most practical way possible, by making the most sweeping changes in the social security system for 50 years. Chief among those changes is the new parenting allowance. That is, over 100,000 low income families will gain up to $211 per fortnight additional income, with an average gain of about $117 per fortnight. The first payments will be made on Thursday, 6 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income test on allowances, particularly jobsearch and newstart allowances, will be reformed to remove poverty traps. As a result, all unemployed people will now always gain financially from accepting additional work, either part time or full time. These initiatives have been warmly welcomed by the welfare sector. They are not the only changes that come into effect, though, next week. The bank deeming rate will be increased to five per cent to ensure that all pensioners have a reasonable return on their bank account deposits. The indexation of pension income and assets test thresholds will also occur. Unlike the opposition, the government is committed to indexation of the pension system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also, in those 50 years, seen a move away from those notions of women as dependent and payments only coming to them because of their state of dependency, to significant changes in the social security legislation as a result of which women will move more and more to entitlements in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of these measures is well under way. People who are affected have been advised by a number of mail-outs from the department. A majority of those expected to gain from the parenting allowance over the full year in fact will do so from the first pay of 6 July. The computer changes are in place. The administrative terms, which is the most critical part of the whole process, are in place and ready to come into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has everything ready for these changes as of 1 July. I believe it is very important to recognise just how significant this raft of social security reforms is and what an excellent 50th anniversary it is with the introduction of that legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is also very important for people to know and very good news. The income test free area for all pensioners will rise from $90 to $94 per fortnight for a single pensioner and from $78 to $82 per fortnight for each member of a pensioner couple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators should also remember that the tax rebate ensures that pensioners whose incomes are within this free area also pay no income tax. As a result, part-rate pensions, which now also include pensioner concession cards, will now be paid on income up to the equivalent of $19,671 per annum for a single pensioner and $32,822 for a pensioner couple. These are the sorts of changes that this government has introduced.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could the Minister in his response also attend to the other question that the productivity gains have been, as EPAC says, passed on to government and presumably not to consumers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Treasurer</EMPHASIS> has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine's question without notice asks about productivity gains by public utilities and the extent to which these gains have been passed on to governments in the form of increased dividends. In this regard he refers to a statement attributed to EPAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the EPAC statement to which Senator Harradine refers was a media release of 26 July 1994 captioned `Microeconomic Reform Paying off for Government Business Enterprises'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EPAC release reported on substantial productivity increases in the government business enterprises sector, far exceeding those estimated for the private sector. As mentioned by Senator Harradine, the EPAC material notes that many of the benefits of increased productivity have been passed on to governments and taxpayers in the form of increased dividends and also comments that the level of competition faced by a GBE has a significant impact on the respective degrees to which customers and owners of the enterprise benefit from macroeconomic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the latter point, one of the main features of the national competition policy reforms is to enhance the competitive environment within which GBEs operate. More competition should lead to further improvements in productivity and efficiency but with a greater likelihood of benefits being passed on to consumers in terms of lower prices and improved products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher dividends being paid by certain GBEs should, however, be considered against the very poor returns many have delivered to their shareholder governments. In the past, the costs to governments of the funds employed in GBEs have frequently exceeded the returns earned from those investments. With the reforms to GBEs in recent years at both Commonwealth and State levels, profitability has increased and dividends to governments have been improved. These developments are appropriate; taxpayers are entitled to a reasonable return on the capital employed in GBES.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Except when there are identified community service obligations it is to the community's benefit to discourage GBEs from making investments which do not produce a commercial return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that increased dividends from GBEs can reduce the pressure on governments to increase taxes or levels of government debt. In an environment of budget deficits, any given level of government expenditure must be financed by a combination of taxes, borrowings and other receipts (including GBE dividends). In that sense, it is not correct to suggest that the public at large does not benefit from increased GBE dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the preceding points the question focuses on the important issue of whether there is an appropriate balance in the distribution of productivity gains from enhanced GBE performance as between employees, consumers and owner governments. In this respect the EPAC estimates indicate that governments have not been the only beneficiaries of microeconomic reforms. Moreover the EPAC estimates are only one of a number of sources of data dealing with this issue. It is clear that consumers as well as governments have substantially benefited from macroeconomic reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of commercialising and corporatising GBEs has involved replacing many of the day-to-day controls on GBEs with new planning and accountability mechanisms, including requirements to pay all Government taxes and charges. These GBE reforms have led to a considerable improvement in GBE efficiency. Since 1989-90, GBE total factor productivity has, according to EPAC, increased by over 6 per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the objective of placing GBEs on a more commercial footing, the Commonwealth has instituted a dividend payout policy which requires GBEs to pay out dividends at a rate similar to levels in the private sector. This, combined with higher productivity, has resulted in dividend payments to the Commonwealth from public trading enterprises increasing over recent years from $69m in 1988-89 to an estimated $949m in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increase in productivity has also allowed a significant reduction in the prices of services offered. For example, according to the Steering Committee on National Performance Monitoring (NPM) of Government Trading Enterprises, since 1989-90 the real price of sending a standard letter through Australia Post has remained constant. Furthermore, Austel figures show that in 1993-94 the price of Telstra's international calls fell by 8.7 per cent, prices of Telstra's domestic long distance calls fell by 5.5 per cent and those of Telstra's mobile calls fell by 7.1 per cent. Telstra price increases have been subject to a CPI minus X regime since 1992 with X equal to 5.5 per cent. As a result, reform of GBEs has enabled both lower real prices and increased dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent publication by the NPM Steering Committee also concludes that both governments and consumers have benefited from corporatisation and increased competition&mdash;prices for the 59 largest Commonwealth and State Government Trading Enterprises fell by an average 3 per cent in real terms between 1989-90 and 1993-94. In addition, the publication concludes that service quality levels have improved in the electricity, water and sewerage, urban transport and railways industries.</PARA>

I can now advise the Senate that he did confirm the account I gave in all relevant respects, adding the further point that he, in fact, disagreed with a number of the positions I had taken in that article.

I can assure the Senate that I will not be spending any of that money for personal enjoyment. The money will be paid into a government trust account and spent on a number of projects, scholarships, prizes and the like&mdash;options for which I am still consulting on and about which I have yet to decide; the intention being that it be in the area of UN reform, peace and security issues of one kind or another.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did put three questions on notice, and I thank the minister for his efforts in trying to get answers. They were directed to Senator Collins because he represents the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), and two of these were submitted over two months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One question deals with issues relating to aircraft used in the construction of the Kuranda skyrail in Far North Queensland and the other deals with matters relating to the Brisbane airport. My question in this area concerns the possibility of extension of the cross runway at Brisbane airport to accommodate larger aircraft as well as the possibility of a curfew at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is appropriate that the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, has been very slow in providing responses to my questions. Those residents of Brisbane who have been affected by the major increases in aircraft noise ever since the new Brisbane airport opened in 1988 have also been asking questions of the transport department. They are also waiting for answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the opening of the new airport, most of the aircraft movement was over Moreton Bay. Since 1988 most air traffic has travelled over suburban areas of Brisbane. This is contrary to the government's indications at the time the airport opened. This planning blunder has never been acknowledged and is therefore continually compounded as air traffic increases. The amount of air traffic into Brisbane airport is likely to increase significantly as we move towards the end of the decade. The impact of aircraft noise on the residents of Brisbane will only worsen unless real steps are taken very soon to address this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe it is time the government listened to the community instead of fobbing them off and hoping that they will either give up or go away. Of course they cannot go away and, as in Sydney, many people have moved to escape the noise and its impact on their quality of life. The government's woeful record with the Sydney airport and its noise problems is shaping up to be repeated in Brisbane. In Sydney, we have seen deception, indecision and inadequate piecemeal planning which has been driven by short-term commercial factors. These take the place of a coherent, long-term policy which considers the interests of the local people. The people of Brisbane do not want to relive that experience. The option of constructing a cross runway has been repeatedly put forward as the solution to aircraft noise. Indeed, the Labor member for Moreton, Mr Gibson, called for this as long ago as 1991. He repeated that call in 1993. Like the pleas of the residents of the area, his pleas have fallen on deaf ears. If the transport minister's tardy response to my questions is any guide it seems he is no more interested in assisting the members of this parliament than he is the average person in suburban Australia. However, having said all that, I eagerly await his answers.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Chapman indicates that there has been an unauthorised disclosure of documents and private deliberations of the Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste, of which he is the chair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His evidence for the unauthorised disclosure is a press release by the Minister for Justice the contents of which, Senator Chapman states, could only have come from documents and private deliberations of the committee. Senator Chapman indicates that this unauthorised disclosure has been damaging to the committee's work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Chapman indicates that he is not raising the conduct of the Minister for Justice, who, as a member of the House of Representatives, may not properly be subject to any inquiry by the Senate, but is raising the unauthorised disclosure of the committee's document and deliberations which must have preceded the minister's press release. This case is therefore different from one raised by Senator Vanstone in September 1994, in which it was clear that it was a member of the House of Representatives who, as a member of a joint committee, was accused of making unauthorised disclosures. In that case I declined to give precedence to a motion because any inquiry by the Privileges Committee would be an inquiry into the conduct of that member of the House. In relation to the matter raised by Senator Chapman, it is clear that the Privileges Committee may inquire into the unauthorised disclosure without investigating the conduct of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I indicated in the 1994 determination, unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings are declared by the Privilege Resolutions of the Senate to be contempts, and as such are taken very seriously.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Gibson this day, relating to the administrative effects of requests for amendments passed by the Senate on 28 June 1995 to sales tax legislation concerning proposed taxation on building materials.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked Senator Cook a question today about the administrative effects of the sales tax requests concerning building materials that were passed by the Senate last night. Those matters have now moved back to the other place. There have been a lot of concerns in the public arena, particularly on the part of wholesalers and retailers of hardware, about what is going to happen on Saturday. Through the media the government has indicated that it is going to give in on this particular tax. That is why I asked the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook took the opportunity to try to blame the opposition for alleged increases in interest rates. What absolute humbug! This is a big-taxing, big-spending government. I remind the Senate and the community that since this government has been in power it has increased total tax revenue from $100 billion in its first budget to a projected $124 billion next year. That is a huge increase in tax revenue taken from the Australian people. It is money that the people will no longer have in their pockets to spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector and most state and territory governments have reduced expenditure over the last few years, particularly since the recession. What has this government done? It has kept spending taxpayers' funds. I remind the Senate and the community that in the budget next year and in its forward projections for the following year the following tax increases will take place: fuel tax, $5 billion; personal income tax, $5 billion; sales tax, $5.2 billion; company tax, $1.9 billion; Medicare levy, $450 million; fringe benefits tax, $930 million; tobacco excise, $950 million; light fuel oil excise, $300 million; company registration fees, $140 million; bank license fees, $380 million; migration application fees, $40 million; and departure tax, $130 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a big-taxing, big-spending government and the poor Australian community is worse off for it. To suggest that the sales tax on building materials, which was scheduled to reap $250 million next financial year, would have a significant impact on the finances of the government and on the budget deficit is absolute nonsense. It is $215 million in a $124 billion take from the community. It is absolutely irrelevant. As Senator Short said the other day, the Qantas float looks like coming in about $500 million short of what the government was originally expecting. Instead of increasing taxes on the people the government should cut its expenditure. </PARA>

It is an absolute furphy, as Terry McGrann says in today's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and most absurdly is the, again near-hysterical, claims by Mr Keating, Mr Willis, new-boy deputy PM Kim Beazley and assorted others, that the Senate's action will cause interest rates to go up or at least prevent them falling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that is hypocrisy on a major scale.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to explain why. It is because this government already has an $8.5 billion deficit built into its own budget, hidden by asset sales and other fiddles. Terry McGrann points straight to the problem, as our shadow Treasurer Peter Costello describes it, as the current account deficit. Mr Costello says that the $215 million or thereabouts that the building tax is supposed to bring in is like a little tiny bucket of sand in this whole economic equation and the current account deficit is like a great big massive roller rolling against the beach. Today Senator Cook is saying, `Watch out, there's the opposition and the Democrats running away with a little bucket of sand.' Behind Senator Cook is this massive great tidal wave called the current account deficit. We will see just how big that wave is tomorrow and what damage that will do to the beach of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I wanted to make&mdash;and I will be as quick as I can&mdash;relates to this government's repeated deceit and Senator Cook's repeated deceit in this chamber about this government's history and performance on interest rates. Senator Gibson asked him a question a couple of weeks ago and Senator Cook had the audacity to say that the Labor Party's record on interest rates was better than that of the former Liberal government. Senator Cook and the Australian people should know&mdash;because I will repeat it until I go hoarse&mdash;that under the former Liberal government real interest rates were half what they have been during the term of this government. Real prime lending rates, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, were 4.08 per cent, on average, during the term of the Fraser coalition government. Under the Hawke and Keating governments, where Mr Keating has had control of the economic levers for the last 12 years, average prime real interest rates&mdash;that is, the real rate, not the nominal rate or what you see in the papers, but what the people really pay&mdash;have been 8.81 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I mentioned those figures last week&mdash;Senator Cook refused to admit it&mdash;I pulled out some figures on real interest rates for Australia in comparison with other OECD nations going right back to 1976. It is interesting to note that my assumption was correct. This government is the highest interest rate government in Australia's history. It has maintained on Australian people, small businesses and home buyers the highest interest rates for the most sustained period in the history of this great nation. In 1976 Australia ranked seventh in terms of real prime lending rates in the OECD, around about average. In 1981 we were about tenth&mdash;about average&mdash;in real prime lending rates. In 1986, when the Keating policies started to take a bite, we jumped up to third in the international rankings, and in 1991 we were first. We had the highest real interest rates in the world. In June 1995, guess where we are? We are number one again. We have the highest real prime lending rates in the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister and this government would have us believe that because the Democrats and the coalition block a building tax, we might have something to do about interest rates. These guys are the experts on interest rates. They know how to make interest rates high and they know how to keep them high. When they want to blame someone for interest rates, they look at the bloke sitting at the head of the cabinet table and his economic ministers&mdash;Mr Keating, Mr Willis and Mr Beazley. They are Mr Interest Rates, Mr Interest Rates and Mr Interest Rates&mdash;the people of big interest rates in this country's history. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to the trade in, and processing of uranium.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to put on the record the close links Cogema and a number of other companies&mdash;including Energy Resources of Australia in the Northern Territory, which is mining Australian uranium&mdash;have with several other uranium deposits in Australia. There are also links with other countries in relation to the enrichment of Australian uranium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do that I want to point out that Minister Collins, in his reply, again ran two furphies. One was that Australia sells France only about three per cent of its requirements&mdash;he mentioned a figure of 11,000 tonnes. Australia sells something like 500 tonnes of uranium a year to France. But he ignored the other important consideration; that is, the amount of Australian uranium that goes through that enrichment plant in France and then goes on to other countries. A great deal more Australian uranium actually goes to France and through that plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other furphy that Minister Collins mentioned was that I was talking about swapping an atom of uranium that might go into a bomb with an atom of uranium that might be used for civil purposes. The fact is we showed that waste uranium, which was still labelled as such, was swapped for highly enriched uranium. There was a very significant diversion of Australian uranium into weapons. We showed that as long ago as 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not just an equivalent amount of uranium; it was uranium that could not be used for another purpose. It had its labels swapped and, as a result, the French were able to acquire highly enriched uranium which was then used for military purposes. This is something which could not have happened had the Australian uranium not been there and had there not been the possibility of flag swapping, as we called it, or label swapping, which I called it yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to ERA and the Cogema connection, Cogema is wholly owned by the French Commissariat de L'Energie Atomique which, through its military applications section, is also responsible for weapons tests. Cogema, in turn, owns the world's largest reprocessing plant at La-Hague. It is through the reprocessing that the plutonium is extracted. That plutonium can either go back into nuclear power stations, particularly breeder reactors, or it can be used&mdash;and this is its principal use at the moment&mdash;in weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its subsidiaries Comurhex and Eurodiff convert and enrich uranium. Cogema has major interests in uranium mining, with shares in mining operations in France, Gabon, Niger, Canada, the US and Australia. In Australia, Cogema owns the Koongarra uranium deposit and the Ben Lomond deposit. These, perhaps, are significant reasons why the Australian government is not prepared to move on the matter of exporting uranium to France. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Cogema also has a share, as I said earlier, in ERA, both directly and via its subsidiaries Urangesselschaft and Saarberg Interuran, which I mentioned in my question. These companies operate in Germany. It is through these connections that a great deal more Australian uranium finishes up going to France than the three per cent to which the government was referring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The representative of the B class shares on the ERA board is Mr Yves Coupin, who is deputy director of Cogema's uranium division and President of Cogema Australia. So there are very close links between the French company, entirely owned by the French government; the enrichment of uranium which goes into nuclear weapons; the reprocessing of uranium which goes into weapons; and Australian uranium going through those plants and into other countries. Those links need to be put fairly and squarely on the public record. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

When any person is to come to this country as an ambassador of another country, I believe it is most important that we scrutinise their background and attitude to such things as human rights and human freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with this in mind that the parliamentarians for East Timor are writing to Senator Evans to remind him of this, stressing that, whilst that body strongly endorses the direction of Australian foreign policy in developing a close and friendly relationship with Indonesia, it still has to stress as strongly as possible that the appointment by Indonesia of such a man as ambassador to Australia is entirely inappropriate and that any withdrawal of those comments by General Mantiri, or any disavowal by him of his previous stance, is just not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans mentioned a precedent involving criminal conduct when Australia, I believe, had refused the credentials of a person who had been appointed as ambassador to this country. I believe this instance is of a similar magnitude, because in this case this person has expressed, in quite strong terms, a denial of the massacre that took place, a denial of the human rights problem which exists on our border. In fact, East Timor is somewhat in the region of 400 kilometres from our northern borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it behoves Australia to scrutinise human rights in the region and to make a stand, but I do not say that it should do that at the cost of its foreign policy or its national interest. I believe strong ties can be maintained with Indonesia, whilst maintaining a strong stance on the human rights question in East Timor. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Foreman this day, relating to the future development of Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to refer to the dorothy dix answer by Senator Collins. This was an important committee and report. It was chaired by Neville Wran, the former ALP President and Premier of New South Wales. It is a pity that many of Mr Wran's party political bias points have now become so blatantly obvious through this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that the minister, Senator Collins, who is also the senator for the Northern Territory, chose to table this report at the end of his answer; therefore, he did an unprecedented tabling in the parliament. By tabling a document in that manner during question time he avoided the process of a normal ministerial statement and scrutiny that would apply in the Senate. It also frustrates the government presenting, at a later date, an appropriate formal response to all the recommendations in the report&mdash;in this case, some 77 recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important report and I am very disappointed by it. I have had the opportunity to peruse the 18 consultancies that were undertaken as part of the $4 million budget. The detail in those 18 consultancies is remarkable. Sadly, it is not reflected in the quality and content of the report that was mentioned here today by Senator Collins, and which was tabled by him. The key to the whole issue is to look at one of the appendices in which two members of the four-person committee put down their own particular comments. One of the commissioners of inquiry, Mr Geoff Stewart, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that a more visionary, bold and imaginative approach towards the development of north Australia's vast trade and investment potential with East Asia is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA>What a damning report. Here is one of Australia's leading commercial figures who is a member of this important inquiry and who, in effect, has to be relegated to the back, to a minority report, in order to present such a view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have perused the 77 recommendations made by the report and I am thoroughly disappointed. There is a $20 million suggested appropriation to look at the issues over a four-year span. But when you go through them, they are all minute tokenism points of administrative detail. There is nothing in it that looks at the resources for economic investment in Australia. There is nothing that looks at the substantive area of funding each sphere of government and how it should be carried out. There is nothing in the report of a substantive nature that talks about infrastructure and maximising the efficient and equitable government service delivery that is so necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of constitutional development of the Northern Territory and the process to statehood is not addressed. There is scant regard to the opportunities for mining and exploration. There is a lot of waffle about social issues. There is a lot of discussion about town planning initiatives and turning Darwin into a green city or whatever. We find a recommendation that we should promote Darwin as an attractive place to live and work. What hypocrisy! It is already a very attractive place in which to live and work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report cost $10,000 per page. What we have got is something that falls far short of our expectations. The committee falls into its own trap. Chapter 2 of the report analyses all the reports on north Australian development since 1913; it sets them all out and explains why they have failed. What does it do? It then turns around and fails to deliver any innovative strategies or policies necessary to develop the Top End's links with East Asia. Instead, all it presents is a very feeble and politically safe document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, 77 recommendations may sound fine when you cite them in number terms, as Senator Collins drew out in a few points. But it really is not a report from which we can take any inspiration. It certainly does not live up to the challenge that the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, set down when he commissioned this report. He said that he wanted it to develop strategies and policies to be developed by the two governments&mdash;the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth&mdash;to take full advantage of Darwin's proximity to East Asia. It has not done that. The report fails to live up to those expectations. In the space of two years, it is very obvious that the federal government has gone cold on the whole concept of what this committee was set up to achieve. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza has raised a matter of principle, although not a direct correlation between the two. There are two things here. It has been traditional over years for the Commonwealth government to fund Commonwealth ministers in the course of their duties if some action is taken against them. Traditionally, they are supported legally if they are sued for defamation on what they have said in representing the government&mdash;but not necessarily for a settlement, as I understand it. I can drag up a lot of Liberal examples in history of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case, the first case that Senator Panizza referred to, is a little different from that. But it is no doubt going to be debated for a full hour later this afternoon, so I will not traverse it. The third question that he raised is one that has never been properly considered by government before; that is, what protection is there for parliamentarians when, in doing what they regard as their public duty, they are sued for defamation? They are in a different position to people sworn into the executive council. But it raises the question of whether they have a right to protection by this parliament. That should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I understand&mdash;I hope that he does not mind my saying it&mdash;Senator Baume is being sued for defamation. Senator Carr is being sued for defamation from someone on the opposition side. According to Senator Panizza, Mr Campbell may be in the same position. The difficulty in drawing the line on this is that one does not want to make people foolhardy; that is, they think they have the Commonwealth budget behind them so they can go out and slag anyone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter we are considering today is a serious matter. It raises a very wide range of questions, but the bottom line question is this: why is this government agreeing to fund Dr Lawrence's legal costs in trying to scuttle the Western Australian royal commission?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a debate about whether Dr Lawrence deserves legal funding before the commission. That is a matter for the Western Australian government to deal with. I understand the Western Australian government has written to Dr Lawrence and asked her to put an application in for what sort of legal assistance she might require before the commission. I want to make it clear at the outset that that is not what this debate is all about. This debate is about this government's decision to fund Dr Lawrence's private legal action being instituted in Western Australia, in effect, to scuttle the Western Australian royal commission, to scuttle the decision of another government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some would be so unkind as to say that the reason she wants to do this is to avoid appearing before the commission. Others would say that this is merely a delaying tactic to try to ensure that her appearance before the commission does not occur prior to an impending federal election. I do not want to go into any of those matters. The point that I want to concentrate on, purely and simply, is this: why is this federal government agreeing to underwrite, to simply pay, to write a blank cheque for one of its ministers to institute private legal proceedings to scuttle the action of another government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that end questions have been asked in this place and in a Senate estimates committee. Finally, a return to order was agreed to by the Senate to try to get some information on this matter. What information could we get that would give us some indication of why the government has come to this decision to give Dr Lawrence effectively a blank cheque. If a normal citizen finds himself or herself in trouble with the law and in trouble with the government and believes that whatever government they are in trouble with has made an error of judgment and is doing the wrong thing in persecuting them, can that ordinary Australian go to legal aid and say, `I want a blank cheque to challenge the action of this government'? Of course they cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason the government has written this citizen a blank cheque is because this citizen happens to be one of its mates, happens now to be a minister in this government. If Dr Lawrence had resigned and was now a private citizen&mdash;this royal commission does not relate in any way to her ministerial duties now&mdash;then this government would not give two hoots what happened to her. It would not be intervening. It would not be underwriting any private litigation she wanted to undertake in order to scuttle the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She is getting this money for one simple reason: she happens now to be a Labor minister. It has nothing to do with the Commonwealth what matters are being looked at in this commission; nothing to do with anything Dr Lawrence has done or not done or might have thought about doing while she was a federal member. It pertains to matters quite outside the jurisdiction of this parliament, things that happened or did not happen, as the case may be, when Dr Lawrence was a member of the Western Australian parliament. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Commonwealth taxpayers. The only link is that Dr Lawrence is a federal Labor minister. I wonder whether the same effort would be made if she were a Labor Party backbencher. As we have already established, all Australians are equal before the law, but some are more equal. Labor ministers are; I wonder whether Labor backbenchers are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put in a perfectly reasonable request. It was possible for the government to supply a suitable range of documents and to explain why some other documents were not given. What were we given? What documents were we given to give us some insight into how this situation came about? We have been given press releases&mdash;they are on the public record&mdash;media statements from other people and transcripts of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. How very generous to give that sort of information! We have been given pretty well nothing else&mdash;a couple of cover sheets on facsimiles, but nothing of any substance from this government at all. Sure we got a letter from the Premier of Western Australia to Dr Lawrence inviting her to indicate what sort of assistance she might need, and we got a response, but nothing that indicates anything about how this government came to this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has tabled a statement, with documents&mdash;these very useless documents&mdash;and indicated that it is not appropriate to comply with the return to order. The basic reasons he offers are these: the documents that exist are legal advice and legal professional privilege would attach to them on the basis that the Commonwealth is not only underwriting Dr Lawrence's action but is going to seek to intervene on its own behalf and has engaged Tom Hughes QC, despite the fact that at the time of engaging him Dr Lawrence's statement of claim had not been drafted&mdash;there is no pocket too deep to delve into to protect this minister; all the documents relate to and were constructed for the purpose of legal proceedings. From the minute someone put pen to paper, anywhere in the Commonwealth, somehow we knew at that time that the Commonwealth was going to be involved in litigation. That is simply beyond belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian royal commission does not pertain to the Commonwealth in any way.

We are asked to believe that every document, every note of every telephone conversation, every memo, every piece of paper, from the minute it was created, was created for the purpose of legal proceedings. Nobody in their right mind would accept that. We certainly do not accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Commonwealth is going to intervene in these proceedings and has had legal advice prepared, there may be a case for that advice to be kept back. Sometimes there might be a dispute about that, but you could make a reasonable claim in that respect. For there to be not one other document that this parliament can see is nothing short of a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does legal professional privilege attach to a simple letter from the Attorney-General to the department seeking advice? Does it attach to a memo of a telephone call from Dr Lawrence to the Attorney-General asking for help? Does legal professional privilege attach to a note of a telephone call or a discussion between Dr Lawrence and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or between the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General on this matter, when things were at a very preliminary stage, before it had entered anybody's head that it might be possible to challenge this commission? Are we asked to believed that there is not one piece of paper in the possession of the Commonwealth, not one document that has travelled through the hands or the office of the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), the Prime Minister or Dr Lawrence that you cannot claim legal professional privilege for? Nobody will believe that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second claim is public interest immunity. I noticed some obfuscation from the government on this point. No-one seems to be prepared to claim that every other document that does not have legal professional privilege is a cabinet document, because they simply cannot all be cabinet documents. You cannot ask the Australian community to accept that out of the blue&mdash;without any other documents being prepared initially, without anybody seeking advice, asking to arrange a meeting, making a note that a meeting was going to take place, making a note that a telephone call took place&mdash;there is not one document like that that is not part of a cabinet submission. You cannot be serious. You cannot really mean it. Hence we see dragged up the other broad scope behind which you want to hide, and that is public interest immunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whom people here are trying to kid that it is in the public interest that the public not be told something&mdash;putting aside the legal advice you might have sought&mdash;and that the public is not entitled to know something about how this government came to this decision. If this decision will stand up to scrutiny, give us the documents and let us see that it will. Let the public make an assessment about the motion we moved to get these documents and the points we make now. Let the community see whether we are grovelling around in the dirt and engaging in some scummy little exercise, which is what you claim, or let them make the assessment that you are engaging in a grubby little exercise. Only the release of these documents will tell us that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can keep the legal advice out of every note of every telephone conversation. It would be very easy to black out those matters that pertain to legal professional privilege or legal advice. That would be perfectly simple to do, and it has been done on plenty of occasions in the past. You are asking us to believe that one day cabinet made a decision and that every document in the Commonwealth's possession in relation to this matter is covered either by legal professional privilege or by being a part of the cabinet file&mdash;from the minute this matter started, with the purpose of the Commonwealth entering into proceedings. That simply cannot be true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can phrase it this way, these proceedings are between the Western Australian royal commission and Dr Lawrence. Until the Commonwealth makes a decision to intervene there is no legal professional privilege. Yet you ask us to believe that on any occasion this has been discussed you can claim legal professional privilege or public interest immunity.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to you that if there is a public interest here it is that the public should have some idea of how you came to this decision. If you are not suggesting that, if you are simply saying that there are no documents that do not have legal professional privilege and that there are no documents that were not in the cabinet submission, you are whistling Dixie if you think anybody will believe you. If you want to say that, you are condemning your government to the public understanding that, when you think you are on thin ice, you do not make a record; you have conversations behind doors; telephone calls that are not noted; or documents and records of such conversations and telephone calls that are later destroyed as a means of preventing any accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just like what happened with the State Bank in my state. It went bung because it got away with off balance sheet budgeting and entering into arrangements that did not show up in the balance sheet. If it is the case that you have not made records that you should have, as a government, or you have destroyed those records of conversations, you are now asking us to accept that we can have off-the-record government. Off-the-record government is just as dangerous as off balance sheet budgeting is for companies. That is why the State Bank went down the chute. If that is the type of activity that this government is up to, you will go down the chute too, and deservedly so. If you have not made proper records of conversations and dates of correspondence between parties, you are into off-the-record government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision you have made to fund the personal litigation of one of your ministers is to scuttle the action of another government.

Where the access to facts about government is open and unobstructed, where the sources of intelligence are numerous and unrestricted, where the official channels to authority are many, misrepresentation is perilous. The possibility of contradiction then rises as a constant threat to authority. But when there are no independent means of verifying official accounts of public transactions, an invaluable check is removed. It then becomes relatively safe for authority to publish such a version of an event as lends the most lustre to government or the least discredit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even where outright falsehood or deceit is not involved, less flagrant misrepresentation may occur. The temptation to sugar-coat each disaster and guild every triumph will prove almost irresistible to officials who are secure against contradiction. Government then can manage the news to its taste.

Because of that, it latches on to issues like this with no consistency. Here we have someone who, for purposes of political voyeurism and nothing else, wants documents that she needs to look at.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pin this process for what it really is, and the person who has pinned it best is the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, Hendy Cowan. He said that this is an exercise in politics and, for that reason, the inquiry could well be damned before it starts. He went on to say that the National Party, the partner of the government in Western Australia, does not believe that the taxpayers should pay for what is essentially an inquiry to achieve a political outcome. If Senator Vanstone were concerned about taxpayers' money, her statement should be directed at the Western Australian Premier, Richard Court, and the person who pulls his strings, Senator Crichton-Browne in this place. This process could be put to an end immediately if you picked up the phone, rang Richard Court and said, `Hey, mate, this is not on. This is just a political exercise and, like Hendy Cowan, I don't believe the taxpayers should be paying for it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the starting point.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the start of this process we made it very clear that you could move your return to order but that very few documents would be tabled because of those two basic principles of government. We made that clear to you, Senator Vanstone, both inside and outside this place, but you have chosen to ignore those principles. That is why your return to order motion is at best vacuous and at worst blatant hypocrisy. It is a disregard of the accepted principles of practice in this place. It is a disregard of accepted principles of government. You know that but, despite knowing it, you come in here with a wish list that you know any responsible government cannot meet. That is your basic starting point and your basic failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You come in here asking for things to be done that you know have not been done in the past and cannot be done now because of those two basic principles. As Greenwood and Ellicott said:</PARA>

<PARA>That principle is there on both sides of the parliament but you do not want to accept it. It applies to both ministers and backbenchers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two fundamental principles of law and administration, but what do you do? You come in here with a return to order that shows a blatant disregard for those principles.

Yet she comes up with a motion that is hypocritical in its nature because it denies those principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also talking about matters that will very soon be before the court. Does Senator Vanstone want to undermine wholesale the federal government's position in this matter? Does she want the legal advice to go to the other side, which we know it would? Does she want to reveal the case? Does she want her mates in Western Australia involved in a political witch-hunt, which is all it is? That is the only motivation she could have in this exercise here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a motivation says to the people, `We do not care about the national interest. We do not care about national perspectives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cases will be before the court soon and a request that would make available the federal government's legal position&mdash;this documentation, this advice on questions asked&mdash;relates to matters that could well be before the courts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not come in here now and deny that.

In the process, a number of important legal issues are raised. If they were not important, you could not sustain a case in court. They are issues that go to the heart of the parliamentary process. They are issues of principle, such as whether the processes of the parliament can be questioned outside the parliament. That is a matter of importance not only to the Western Australian parliament, but wherever the Westminster system applies, particularly on a federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also issues that go to the confidentiality of the cabinet process. If the tables were reversed, if a state Labor government were picking on a federal Liberal government, attacking those basic principles of constitutional practice, attacking cabinet solidarity and the proceedings of parliament, you would be the first ones in here screaming for intervention to ensure that the processes of the parliament were protected against such an unprincipled attack from outside. We have a responsibility to be part of this. We have a responsibility to intervene once this process is under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General made it very clear in his tabling statement today that there are precedents, and most of them originate from state Liberal governments in their processes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a charade, and it should be recognised as such, because for Senator Vanstone to ask for more than what she got today would be for her to deny any knowledge of basic constitutional practices in this place&mdash;practices which go very much to professional legal privilege and very much to the processes of cabinet and cabinet confidentiality. They are processes which have been consistently acknowledged and which were last reflected in 1972 in documents prepared by former Liberal Attorneys-General Ellicott and Greenwood and are principles that this government is pursuing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I refer to the statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) which, I believe, accompanied these documents and which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the establishment of the Royal Commission offends one of the most basic principles of parliamentary democracy. The Bill of Rights of 1688 states that the proceedings of Parliament are not to be questioned in any place out of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister is saying that the royal commission which has been called in Western Australia infringes section 16 of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Privileges Act. On looking at that section, I put it to the minister that I think he has missed the point. Section 16 talks about the protection provisions of article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 applying to the parliament of the Commonwealth. I put it to the Senate that the royal commission in Western Australia does not relate to proceedings in the parliament of the Commonwealth&mdash;the Senate or the House of Representatives&mdash;but relates to proceedings which took place in the state parliament and thereby is a matter quite discrete from the business conducted in both houses of the Commonwealth. Therefore, section 16 has no application at all, as the royal commission in Western Australia is dealing only with matters pertaining to the state parliament and not to the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the remarks made by Senator Vanstone: in this return to order, we have seven press releases which are on the public record; we have extracts from the estimates committee and from the business in this chamber&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS>, of course, are freely available to senators; we have media transcripts from an interview with Carmen Lawrence and two with Hendy Cowan; and we have the advertisement for the royal commission in Western Australia giving the terms of reference, and a media statement accompanying those terms of reference. None of that is of a private nature whatsoever. The only thing of interest that I found was the guidelines from both the Legislative Council of Western Australia and the Commonwealth of this country for determining legal assistance to ministers and government officers. I will come to that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not saying that there should be an abrogation of legal privilege in the motion for a return to order. In the documents that were sought, we have copies of correspondence between Dr Lawrence and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), and that is hardly protected by legal privilege. We have sought copies of correspondence between the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and that is not in any way affecting legal privilege. We have correspondence between the Prime Minister and Dr Lawrence&mdash;again no legal privilege would attach. And we have copies of any notes, memos, briefs and documents prepared by a Commonwealth official relating to the same matter. I doubt whether that would be protected by legal privilege, either. Subsection (v) of the resolution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">copies of any legal advice prepared by any Government lawyer in relation to the same matters.</PARA>
<PARA>I concede that there could be matters of legal privilege there. Nonetheless, the minister has said that there are matters of public interest immunity and legal privilege which restrict the minister from providing documents in this return to order. I can only assume that those documents must be voluminous because this is a matter of some weight and importance and it has been before cabinet, yet all we have been given are the documents that I have referred to. I suggest that that would be only the tip of the iceberg. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that what we have here is a question of accountability. I refer to Senator Bolkus's comments: this is not a question of attacking a person; it is a question of bringing the government to account for how it came to make this decision. As I understand it, Carmen Lawrence has applied to the state government of Western Australia for assistance in relation to the royal commission, and I am not aware of any decision having been made yet. I would have said to the Commonwealth Attorney-General that it would have been wise to wait to see what happened there before making any decision as to the provision of assistance to Carmen Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all about accountability, and if government members were in opposition, they would be doing exactly what the coalition is doing here&mdash;that is, seeking some sort of accountability. I understand that Senator Bolkus says there is a process, but that process does not deny or shut out accountability to the taxpayer of moneys to be spent. That process is an important process, and I am the first one to acknowledge that there should be cabinet confidentiality. However, when you make decisions of this sort, there are available, beyond the protection of cabinet confidentiality, documents and procedures which are well within the purview of the Australian taxpayer. That is what we have here. We have the government overreacting to a call by the coalition simply asking: how did you arrive at this decision; what are the guidelines; what criteria do you apply? There is absolutely no harm in that. In fact, the coalition is doing its job as a responsible opposition in seeking that information on behalf of taxpayers. I think it is an area that needs clarification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Senator Ray said earlier that he was going to write to the Attorney-General in relation to representation or assistance being offered to ministers, and possibly members and officers of the Commonwealth, in various matters. I would be the first to say that you do not give members of parliament, senators, ministers or officers a blank cheque book for legal proceedings, but I do think that the government needs to address the question of how it makes ex gratia payments for legal assistance to ministers and officers of the crown. I also ask the government to address whether it would do the same for shadow ministers in this situation. I believe that it is not only ministers of the government of the day that could well be entitled to some protection; if you were to be even-handed in a democratic sense, that sort of assistance should be looked at for opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be strict guidelines which state that the assistance relates only to the performance of one's duties. Guideline No. 2 of the Commonwealth's guidelines states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a Minister becomes involved as a defendant in litigation arising out of the performance of his or her Ministerial duties, the facts of the matter should be referred to the Attorney-General for consideration as to whether it is appropriate for assistance in accordance with these guidelines to be provided at Commonwealth expense.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest in the strongest possible terms that Carmen Lawrence was not a minister of this government and was not even a member of the Commonwealth parliament when all these issues arose. We are talking about a petition which was presented to the state parliament when she was a member of the state parliament. I would submit that it does not come within the Commonwealth guideline No. 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the government has overlooked or ignored its own guideline. In this instance, the government has much to account for, and I call upon the government to answer in relation to that guideline how it would justify such a decision. I still believe that, at the end of the day, it was  unwise for the Attorney-General to state that the government would assist Carmen Lawrence in the event that she did not get assistance. I think it would have been pertinent for him to have made that decision once the minister had been refused assistance from the state government in Western Australia, which I understand she has applied to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole matter reeks of a lack of accountability.

One thing that the government has given us is a media alert which says, `The Honourable Carmen Lawrence will hold a press conference in room 1R4 at 1.30 p.m. today. Contact Brenda Conroy 2277220'.

The minister said today, `The opposition's state colleagues thought that the provision of legal assistance was appropriate in cases where corruption or maladministration was being alleged'. Yet those state members now have the hypocrisy, according to the minister, to claim that the government should not fund Dr Lawrence's legal costs when no such allegation is before the Western Australian royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can the government not see the difference? Dr Lawrence was not a member of this parliament at that time. The people of Australia have a right to know why this is being done. We have a return to order which was set down for 9 o'clock this morning. The government agreed to provide the documents. The government should still be bound by the agreement to provide the documents instead of just providing a bunch full of nonsense that we have already read. There is virtually nothing in this bunch of documents that is not already on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How on earth can the government believe that this complies with the return to order that was agreed in the Senate yesterday for 9 o'clock this morning? This government has a responsibility to provide the documentation not only to the parliament but to the people of Australia. We are not for one moment talking about disclosing legal advice or the intricacies of it. That is the curtain behind which the government is hiding. It is false to suggest that we are trying to find out the legal ramifications and the legal intricacies of Dr Lawrence's defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about is the details of why and how this Labor government reached its decision to spend Commonwealth taxpayers' money on defending a member of the federal parliament in an action which relates to Dr Lawrence's activities while she was a member of a state parliament. We can make it no clearer than that. The government has a responsibility to let this parliament know and to provide the supporting documents as to how that decision was reached. There are no ifs, no buts, and no maybes. That was the request. It has not been complied with. The government has a responsibility to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us make some things very clear. The Marks royal commission is not a Commonwealth commission or a Commonwealth inquiry. This is a Western Australian state matter and it involves issues and matters which relate to the actions or knowledge of Carmen Lawrence in a former incarnation as the Premier of Western Australia. It does not involve matters that in any way relate to her current role as the federal Minister for Health and Human Services. If it did, she would be covered by the guidelines for the provision of assistance to Commonwealth government ministers and parliamentary secretaries in relation to the defence of legal proceedings which were provided under Senator Vanstone's return to order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the second time in a month the government has used a very narrow definition of what it is required to table under a return to order to exclude any document which may be damaging to its cause. I suppose we should not be surprised by this action. However, the government should not be surprised that the Senate will take a very hard line in enforcing its return to order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a few minutes I will move an amendment to Senator Vanstone's motion, but I would like to make a brief comment on the response by the minister to the concerns raised by Senator Vanstone. The Greens looked very carefully at the terms of Senator Vanstone's return to order. If it had involved any of the aspects that the minister raised, we would not have supported it. We do not believe that it does request material that will require legal advice that should, quite properly, be covered by legal privilege. Neither do we believe that the public interest issue is one that can be used to justify failing to reveal the rationale for public funding expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not asking for legal information. That has not been the content of the request. If it had, we would have seriously considered not supporting it. The reason we agreed to support it was because we believed it was a very legitimate question that needed to be asked. We had an appalling response to the call to order and the reasons why the documentation was so inadequate. It does not represent fair and open government and it may well be argued that the Premier of Western Australia has been blatantly political or opportunistic in calling for the royal commission. I have a degree of sympathy with that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government is exposing itself to the exact accusation for entering into an agreement to use public money to fight against the legality of the royal commission. If it has the capacity to defend itself from that argument, it should be readily observable in the files which document the decision-making process that was followed. That has not been done.  Therefore, I will move an amendment to Senator Vanstone's motion. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add "but the Senate is of the opinion that the Minister representing the Attorney-General is in contempt of the Senate by failing to comply with all the terms of the order for production of documents agreed to by the Senate on 28 June 1995 and orders that he purge his contempt by tabling all remaining documents by 6.00 p.m. this evening.".</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this is a principle that this Senate needs to uphold. The government needs to demonstrate its accountability. If we have off-the-record government, as Senator Vanstone calls it, it is a real worry. It is a great worry that we cannot provide proper accountability and transparency by way of record to the community and to this parliament for the expenditure of public funds for an individual in a private capacity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of issues involved in this return to order. I made known an amendment yesterday which resulted in the final shape of Senator Vanstone's first motion. In the event, it was actually  moved by the government. In my suggested amendment I excised all those paragraphs in the original motion which appeared to pre-judge the issue, and left the bare bones of an order for the production of documents. It was strictly limited to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The documents requested were documents providing advice on whether or not Dr Lawrence, the Commonwealth Minister for Human Services and Health, should receive legal assistance through the Commonwealth. It did not ask for the production of documents which provided advice on the substantive issues of the legal position in which she found herself. It is very difficult to see why there could be any legal privilege attaching to documents which simply and exclusively deal with the question of whether or not Dr Lawrence should receive Commonwealth assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that particular area, the issue is whether the acts or omissions of Dr Lawrence, while she was premier of the state of Western Australia, continue to be relevant in her current position as the Commonwealth minister for health and whether the Commonwealth government, as a consequence of that, is entitled to use public funds to provide legal assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said by others, it is fairly clear that the actions of the Western Australian government are motivated by political considerations. It is also fairly clear that if Dr Lawrence was not the Commonwealth minister for health, it would be doubtful whether the Western Australian government would have instituted this particular inquiry. There is an argument which says that there could well be a reason why the Commonwealth government would be justified in providing that assistance. Against that, we have the very clear separation of functions. In the first instance, we have Dr Lawrence acting as the Premier of Western Australia. She is now the minister for health at a Commonwealth level. The inquiry to which she has been invited to respond is an inquiry into actions or omissions of hers while she was the Premier of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the issues are not easy to resolve. It is the duty of the Senate, not just the right of the Senate, to examine these issues and to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. I believe that the Senate has the right to require the documents be placed before the Senate that were requested by the order for the production of documents which was passed yesterday. I sought to have it amended to be limited, very clearly and very narrowly, to documents which relate to the issue and advice as to whether or not Dr Lawrence should receive that legal assistance, not in any way to the substantive issue that is before the Western Australian inquiry. On that basis, the Australian Democrats continue the support that I announced yesterday for the production of the documents that were asked for and that the Senate has not yet received. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my view, the issue in this case is a very simple one: whether or not a part of parliament&mdash;not parliament&mdash;can properly attack executive privilege under section 61 of the constitution. There are times when parliament, as distinct from the Senate, can do so. Perhaps the best statement of that is the decision of the United States v. Richard M.

<PARA>A criminal trial was involved and the need for fair administration of justice had to be balanced against the importance of the President's general privilege of confidentiality. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While taking note of the doctrine of separation of powers, the Court observed that there is no unqualified presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The court was talking about judicial process. In this debate, we are talking about legislative process. It cannot be compared with the situation that might operate in England, which does not have a constitution to guide the way people go about their operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Senate is involved in&mdash;I said it before and I come back to it&mdash;is not the exercise of parliamentary power, but the exercise of Senate power.

Why don't they get the House of Representatives to join with the Senate and get the assent of the Governor-General acting on behalf of the Queen&mdash;which is the process you have to go through&mdash;to talk about parliamentary exercise in this context?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Family Law Reform Bill 1994 and the Exposure Family Law Reform Bill (No 2) 1994 were referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for a second report to deal with a range of concerns which were expressed to the Committee in submissions at its hearing on 6 June 1995. The Government took note of the submissions made to the Committee and has given detailed consideration to the matters raised in the hearing before the Committee and in the report of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family law is an area of the law which touches the lives of so many Australians. The reforms proposed in the Bills aim to provide a means by which parents, when separating, can resolve matters between themselves with dignity, certainty and in the best interests of their children. When making arrangements for the future parenting of their children, parents should not resolve matters in their own interests but in the interests of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The further hearing on the Bills enabled a detailed consideration of a number of important issues. The Government will be accepting all the Committee's recommendations for amendment to the Act and thanks the Committee for its second</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESPONSE TO INDIVIDUAL RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1: The Committee recommends that specification of grandparents be considered as an amendment to section 69C of the Family Law Reform Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee has asked the Government to give consideration to the specification of grandparents in the Family Law Act, in particular in proposed section 69C. Over the period since the issue was raised with the Government by the Grandparents' Action Group of WA and, particularly since the Committee's hearing on 6 June 1995, this matter has been very carefully considered. The Government recognises the importance of the role which may be played by grandparents after separation and, in particular, the benefits that children may gain from continuing positive contact with grandparents. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current provisions of the Family Law Act, any person who has an interest in the welfare of the child&mdash;including grandparents&mdash;may institute proceedings and seek orders. Where proceedings are on foot, the Court may grant leave to another person to intervene and has in fact done so to allow grandparents to be heard. The Bill continues this situation, allowing grandparents to make applications and to be heard in proceedings relating to children, but with one fundamental change. The Bill presents a consistent theme so that attitudes will shift away from self interest and centre upon the child's best interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes, in addition, that the Joint Select Committee on the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act concluded that it was not necessary to amend the Act to provide an express reference to grandparents, a view which has been supported by the Chief Justice of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that more should be done to encourage separating parents to consider the beneficial role that grandparents may play, and will address this issue in the educational campaign accompanying the reforms contained in the Bill. While recognising the valuable role that grandparents may play, the Government believes that the legislation needs to present a proper balance, consistent with the theme of the child's best interests, and not unduly limit the Court's consideration of the best interests of the child in an individual case. The Government is concerned that an amendment to the proposed section 69C might detract from that fundamental theme. The focus of the legislative reforms should therefore remain upon the child's best interests, and the arrangements or court orders which will best promote those interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that the objects of Part III "Primary Dispute Resolution" be amended to include in paragraph 14 (a) of the clause words bolded along the following lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(a) to encourage people to use <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">primary dispute resolution mechanisms, that is</EMPHASIS> counselling, mediation or arbitration or other means of conciliation or reconciliation, to resolve matters, provided such mechanisms <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">are appropriate in the circumstances of the case and proper procedures are followed, in preference to litigation</EMPHASIS> in which a court order might otherwise be made under this Act;"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government response: The Government accepts this recommendation. In so doing, the Government notes the concerns expressed to the Senate Committee that there needs to be greater awareness that decisions to use primary dispute resolution should reflect a sensitivity and acknowledgment of issues in relation to family violence. The Government proposes to reflect this concern by amending the Objects provision to Part III to ensure that when the primary dispute resolution alternatives are used that regard be paid to the need for proper protection for individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that the Objects of Part VII "Children" be amended to include the words "except if it is contrary to the child's best interests" in paragraph (b) of the principles in subsection 60B (2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government response: The Government accepts this recommendation. The Senate Committee heard evidence that the second principle in the proposed section 60B (2) (b) of the Reform Bill should contain the words "except if it is contrary to the child's best interests" so that the Bill does not give the impression that the child's right of contact with both parents is unqualified. Notwithstanding that the Bill provides for decisions to be made in the best interests of the child through section 68F, the Government proposes to amend the Bill to include the words requested to make it clear that the child's right of contact is not unqualified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is also consistent with recommendation 2.6 in the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report No 73 "For the Sake of the Kids" tabled on 20 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that section 68K be redrafted to express in positive terms that the Family Court, when making an order, must have regard to safeguards in order to avoid exposure to family violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government response: The Government accepts this recommendation. The concern expressed to the Senate Committee was that some provisions of the Bill did not have the right balance when considering contact between a child and others where there has been family violence or a family violence order has been made. Section 68K was mentioned in this regard. The Government therefore proposes that this concern be addressed by redrafting the provision in accordance with the recommendation to ensure the Court strikes the appropriate balance between protection of individuals and the right of the child to contact with both parents and significant others in accordance with Australia's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This, of course, would only occur in circumstances where it is not contrary to the child's best interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, an appropriate regulatory regime, specifying qualifications and standards, be developed for approved counsellors and mediators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government response: The Government accepts this recommendation. The Justice Statement released in May 1995 announced the establishment of a specialist Advisory Council to ensure high standards in alternative dispute resolution and to develop informed policy advice about the use and regulation of alternative dispute resolution. The Government proposes that the development of regulations be through a broadly based consultative arrangement including the proposed advisory council on ADR announced in the Justice Statement, the Family Law Council, the Family Law Section of the Law Council of Australia, the Family Services Council, the National Women's Justice Coalition and others who have an interest in the development of such a regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional Issues. There are two additional issues which the Committee has not recommended but which the Government believes should be changed:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A concern expressed to the Committee was that the name "special purpose orders" suggests that these matters would only be considered in circumstances which themselves are unusual or special. In cases of family violence, it has been argued that where such an order is required, it may be difficult to obtain. The Government believes this is not the case but to dispel any doubt, the Government proposes to change the name from "special purpose" to "specific issues order"; and'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attention has been drawn by the Australian Law Reform Commission to proposed subparagraph 68F (2) (f) (ii) which is one of the factors that the Court must take into account in making an order in the best interests of the child. That factor requires the Court to consider the physical and psychological effects of violence in the presence of the child when deciding matters in the best interest of the child. Concern was raised by the Australian Law Reform Commission that this provision may unintentionally limit the Court's consideration of the effect of violence on the child's well-being. To dispel any doubt that this may limit other factors, which require that the effects of violence per se be considered, the Government will be amending the Bill in the terms recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs (the Committee) conducted an inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (the FTR Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received 66 written submissions and conducted public hearings in Sydney and Melbourne in June 1993. Written submissions were received from a variety of interested individuals and bodies. Many of those who made submissions also appeared before the Committee, including financial institution representative organisations, finance industry unions, state treasury and revenue officials, organisations representing the legal profession, three major banks, a major civil liberties organisation, and relevant Commonwealth agencies. The contributions of these individuals and bodies are gratefully acknowledged by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Report of the Committee follows on from the Committee's earlier evaluation in 1988 of the Cash Transaction Reports Bill. That earlier Report recommended that if the Bill were enacted, its operation "be reviewed after a suitable period of time, preferably not longer than 3 years, and that the review include the economic, taxation, privacy and law enforcement implications of the Bill".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would like to thank the Committee for the thoroughness of its report and its constructive suggestions for legislative amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found the operation of the FTR Act to be cost effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government accepts in principle the majority of the Committee's recommendations, and will be taking action in the near future (including by amendment of the FTR Act) to implement those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TERMS OF REFERENCE</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">any other matters relevant to the effective operation of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND TO THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS ACT 1988</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Costigan Royal Commission showed the importance of being able to trace financial transactions in the effort to curtail organised crime and reduce tax evasion. As well as "following the money trail" the Costigan Report also recommended tighter requirements for record-keeping by financial institutions, so as to provide a firmer basis for tracing transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre, formerly the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, began operation in 1989. AUSTRAC receives reports on cash and other financial transactions as required by the Act, and analyses and disseminates to law enforcement agencies and the Australian Taxation Office, information relating to those reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objects of the FTR Act are to facilitate the administration and enforcement of taxation and other laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act imposes a number of obligations on "cash dealers" and their customers in order to counter use of the financial system to facilitate or disguise criminal conduct. The term "cash dealers" includes not only banks, credit unions and building societies, but also securities dealers, futures brokers, bullion dealers, casinos, bookmakers and gambling houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee examined the quantity of significant cash transaction reports, the cost of compliance and the method of delivery of data to AUSTRAC, and the acceptance of the erosion of banker-customer confidentiality. The Committee accepted that reporting of significant cash transactions should be retained generally in its present format, partly because it was not possible to form a concluded view on the forensic value of the information collected. The Committee also noted that efforts should be taken to contain the costs imposed on cash dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most controversial of the provisions of the Act has been the requirement that cash dealers verify the identity of persons opening new accounts. The Committee has noted that the account opening procedures were the subject of much comment in the evidence to the Committee, and that the number of changes made to the account opening procedures in just two years of operation is an indication that they are unsatisfactory. The Committee recommends that the account opening provisions be made much more flexible, and that AUSTRAC be given a wider auditing role to ensure that cash dealers comply with their obligations. The Government accepts this recommendation and will be working with representatives of the major cash dealers to establish satisfactory procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During its inquiry the Committee was told of a suggested threat the FTR Act posed to the privacy and civil liberties of members of the community. The Committee noted that AUSTRAC has been very conscious of civil liberties issues and was impressed with AUSTRAC's consciousness of the need to secure the sensitive information which is provided to it. To better protect civil liberties and privacy, the Committee recommended that a person representative of civil liberties concerns be appointed to two key advisory committees, and that the Director of AUSTRAC have the power to delete information from the AUSTRAC database in appropriate circumstances. The Government accepts these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After examining the way in which AUSTRAC stores and analyses the data reported to it and how AUSTRAC's clients use AUSTRAC's databases, and discussing AUSTRAC's participation in task forces, the Committee recommended that AUSTRAC engage only in activities that fall squarely within the confines of the FTR Act. The Government agrees that where there is any doubt about whether an action is allowed, legal advice will be obtained. The Committee endorsed AUSTRAC's analysis of data, "the moral distinction between collecting material obtained by force of law and without reference to its creator, and analysing it without the knowledge of its producer or supplier, is so narrow as to make it appropriate to treat both processes on the same basis. If it is reasonable for AUSTRAC to gather material, it is reasonable for it to order and deal with it in ways that show up pattens of behaviour and the pursuit of a particular course of conduct."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considered submissions made about the conduct of some members of the legal profession, but recommended that the definition of "cash dealer" not be altered to include solicitors. The Government proposes to require legal practitioners to take on some of the reporting obligations, and report to AUSTRAC transactions in cash (currency) of $10,000 and above with their clients, including in the report particulars of the identity of the client as known to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommended that the FTR Act be reviewed again in a further three years. The Government accepts that periodic review is appropriate, but considers a five year interval is more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the Committee's recommendations require amendments to the FTR Act. Briefly these are:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO INDIVIDUAL RECOMMENDATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1: The Committee recommends that AUSTRAC should engage only in those activities which are clearly and unequivocally allowed under the relevant Act. Where there is doubt about an action it proposes to take it should seek the enactment of legislation that unquestionably supports it. For example, it should ensure it has legislative authority to participate in NCA task forces. (Para 3.25)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that AUSTRAC must engage only in activities allowed under the FTR Act. The Government does not accept that the inference can properly be drawn from the Committee's recommendation that AUSTRAC has acted ultra vires the powers conferred upon it by the FTR Act. Where there is any doubt whether an action is allowed, legal advice will be obtained. Advice has been obtained that AUSTRAC is able to participate in NCA task forces subject to it being made clear that AUSTRAC has no investigative role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that the reporting threshold for significant cash transaction reports should not be allowed to erode significantly through inflation. To achieve this the threshold should be adjusted periodically after consultation with cash dealers. The aim of the adjustment should be to maintain the threshold at, or near, the present amount in real terms. (Para 4.22)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts the recommendation and, because of the current very low rate of inflation, notes that making a deposit of $10,000 in cash into an account is still a significant and unusual transaction (not only for an individual). As the Committee noted, adjusting the threshold would add to the costs of cash dealers, because of the need to rewrite computer software for electronic reporting. The situation will continue to be monitored. The Government accepts the Committee's counsel that efforts must be taken to contain the costs imposed upon cash dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that those cash dealers engaging in a sufficient number of significant cash transactions to warrant the measure should endeavour to provide the reports by electronic means. (Para 4.22)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with this recommendation. To their credit, banks and other financial institutions have voluntarily reported data electronically to AUSTRAC. This means that the cost of reporting, both for the cash dealers and for the Government has been much less over time than it would have been if paper reporting had been used. The data reported electronically is subjected to appropriate safeguards including encryption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that suspect reporting be retained in its present form. Privacy interests should be better protected than at present by adopting Recommendations 7-10 below. (Para 5.39)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that the present account opening requirements of the FTR Act should no longer be a mandatory minimum procedure. Instead the Act should impose upon cash dealers an obligation to take reasonable steps to satisfy themselves of the identity of signatories to an account. The present mandatory procedures should become standard procedures to apply in most cases. Cash dealers should have the discretion to depart from the standard procedures where the circumstances so warrant. The onus should be on the cash dealer to prove that the circumstances warranted a departure from the standard procedure and that in its opinion the customer's identity has been established. (Para 6.30)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts Recommendation 5.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Advisory Committee has been asked to put forward proposals for procedures to give effect to this recommendation. Wide ranging consultations on the details of the proposals will be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6: AUSTRAC should have the function, and the necessary resources, to audit the performance of cash dealers in complying with the statutory duty to satisfy themselves of the identity of their customers. (Para 6.30)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts Recommendation 6, as flowing from Recommendation 5.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that the FTR Act be amended so that ATO no longer has a right of access to FTR data but has access to FTR data on the same basis as law enforcement agencies, that is, on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding entered into with the Director, AUSTRAC. (Para 7.28)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges the important issues raised in the background to this recommendation and believes that privacy and secrecy arrangements already in place satisfy the thrust of the recommendation that the ATO not have an untrammelled right of access to FTR information. The ATO has agreed upon a Memorandum of Understanding with AUSTRAC and now accesses data on the same basis as Commonwealth law enforcement agencies.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation. The Ministerial Advisory Committee has been asked to make a recommendation about an appropriate appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends that the advice of the Privacy Commissioner be sought by the Director of AUSTRAC whether to appoint a civil liberties representative either to an existing AUSTRAC advisory committee, or to establish a separate advisory committee on privacy and civil liberties issues.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 10: The Committee recommends that the FTR Act be amended to give the Director of AUSTRAC power to authorise the deletion of FTR information from the AUSTRAC database in appropriate circumstances. (Para 7.35)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation and the persuasiveness of the Committee's reasons. Legislative amendment will be required to implement the recommendation. However, the Government believes that the deletion of FTR information should occur only in accordance with guidelines developed by the Director in consultation with appropriate parties including law enforcement agencies, revenue agencies and the Privacy Commissioner. The reporting requirements leading to the creation of FTR information have not been in existence long enough to establish pattens of usage and usefulness of FTR information. The Government has decided to defer implementation of the recommendation until a reasonable and practicable period for the usual use of FTR information has been clarified. The Government would expect the recommendation to be implemented gradually.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 12: The Committee recommends that State and Territory revenue authorities be given access to FTR information on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding to be entered into with the Director of AUSTRAC and subject to such conditions as the Director requires.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation. The Ministerial Advisory Committee has been asked for its views on how best to achieve protection of tellers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 17: The Committee considers that there should not be strict liability under section 31. It should be required that the prosecution establish that the defendant conducted the relevant transactions with the intent of evading the reporting requirements of the FTR Act. (Para 10.38)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts that the creation of a strict liability offence may in certain circumstances infringe civil liberties. It is the Government's policy to legislate on the basis of strict liability only if this is justified by the inherent difficulty of proving the mental element in respect of the offence. Although the offence created by s3l is formulated without reference to a mental element, it has been established by the decision of the High Court in He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 528 that where a statute defines an offence by reference only to external elements and does not refer to any mental state, there is a presumption that mens rea is an essential element of the offence. The presumption may be displaced by consideration of matters such as the subject matter of the offence and whether strict liability would facilitate enforcement. In so far as the offence of structuring created by s3l requires an objective assessment of the culpability of the alleged offender, taking into account any explanation for the manner or form of the transactions proffered by that person, the Government is of the view that the provision in its current form impliedly incorporates an element of mens rea. Accordingly, the Government does not consider the common law presumption to have been displaced in the case of this offence, and considers the current formulation of the provision to be the most appropriate formulation to achieve the objects of the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 20: The Committee recommends that section 42 of the FTR Act be amended so that administrative decisions made under the Act are reviewable under the AD(JR) Act.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 22: The Committee recommends that the definition of `cash dealer' in the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 not be widened to include solicitors. (Para 11.25)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes that the reporting obligation on cash dealers is to report to AUSTRAC `suspect' transactions, `significant' transactions ($10,000 and above in cash) and international funds transfer instructions, and to verify the identity of account holders as well as to maintain various records. The Government accepts that it is not appropriate to require legal practitioners to report `suspect' transactions, (this would be difficult to reconcile with the responsibility of a solicitor to assert legal professional privilege), to verify the identity of their clients, or to report international funds transfer instructions. However, the Government proposes to require legal practitioners to report to AUSTRAC transactions in cash (currency) of $10,000 and above with their clients, including in the report particulars of the identity of the client as known to them. Such a report involves only objective facts and does not require legal practitioners to form opinions or suspicions about the affairs of their clients. Further, there will be no requirement for legal practitioners to go behind their clients' backs, as, in the unusual case where a transaction involves $10,000 in cash, the practitioner may, and can be expected to, advise the client of the requirement for the report.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as providing $150 million towards the cost of staging the Sydney Games and up to $25 million toward the cost of the Paralympics, the Commonwealth Government will provide $140 million to sport in 1995-96. This includes $46 million to Olympic sport through the "Maintain the Momentum" program and the "Olympic Athlete" program ($135 million over six years) which is designed to ensure the best possible preparation of Australia's athletes for the Atlanta and Sydney Games. The Federal Government is making a substantial contribution to the preparation of Olympic and Paralympic athletes ($263 million in total) and therefore to the success of the Sydney Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Additional measures to be taken to secure commercial property rights for the Games organisers in the Olympic words and symbols.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. The Government will develop legislation aimed at preventing the unauthorised use of Sydney Games Indicia, in order to protect the sponsorship revenue of the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games. The rights in the Indicia will vest in the Games Organisers&mdash;the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) in respect of the Olympics and the Sydney Paralympics Organising Committee (SPOC) in respect of the Paralympics.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. A publicity campaign to inform the public including consumers and marketers of the additional and extraordinary measures which are to be taken to protect the Olympic words and symbols. The campaign should also assist the public to clearly identify Olympic sponsors so that if individuals wish to make a purchase to support the Olympic Games, they can do so with confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth sees the announced response to the Senate inquiry and any publicity associated with the introduction and passage of legislation through Parliament as contributing toward this objective. Beyond that, the Government sees this as essentially the responsibility of the Games organisers. The Government considers that immediate and public exposure of Companies that are considered to be engaging in ambush marketing would be an effective deterrent to other companies considering similar conduct.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. That specific purpose legislative measures be introduced to facilitate the Olympic organisers' ability to seek and obtain urgent injunctions to stop any contravention. The Canadian legislation provides a model for such a provision. The provision could provide a statutory presumption that [a breach of] the rights conferred upon the organisers would occasion immediate and irreparable damage to the organisers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. The legislation that the Government proposes will provide the Games organisers and the official sponsors with the ability to seek and obtain urgent injunctions from the Federal Court. The Government also considers that it would be sensible to confer jurisdiction on State and Territory Supreme Courts and will consult with State and Territory Governments in the near future to this end. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. That the Courts be able to make an order requiring an offender to place corrective advertisements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. The legislation that the Government proposes will provide that the Courts will also be able to award damages.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Committee supports the protection of a range of protected words, sounds and images along the lines proposed by the joint NSW and SOCOG submission. The Committee recommends that the following expressions be protected:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the combination of the word "24th", "Twenty-Fourth" or "XXIVth" and the word "Olympic" or "Olympics" or "Games"; or</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. The Government will protect these words against unauthorised commercial use which is likely to convey a connection with the Sydney 2000 Olympics or Paralympics, their organisers and other associated parties. The words "Two thousand" and "2000" will be added to List B, in order that the expressions such as "Two Thousand Olympics" or "Olympics 2000" are protected.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The Committee recommends the protection of Sydney Games images or sounds used in a context which would to the ordinary person represent a connection with the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Sydney Games bodies;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Sydney 2000 Olympics;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The Sydney 2000 Paralympics;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Any activities arranged by or in connection with the Sydney Games bodies, the Sydney 2000 Olympics or the Sydney 2000 Paralympics; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) Any Sydney Olympic Sites and Buildings.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"Sydney Games images or sounds"</EMPHASIS> means any image or sound evoking the Sydney 2000 Games, Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games, teams attending the Sydney 2000 Games and Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games and any athletes who are members of such teams.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"Sydney Games Bodies"</EMPHASIS> includes the SOCOG, IOC, AOC, City, the Government of New South Wales, IPC, SPOC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government reserves its position on this recommendation. Such wide ranging protection would leave the discretion of who to target with the Games' organisers, with the potential for overzealous use and the pursuit of people for legitimate activities. It will also be necessary to take into account the rights acquired in images or sounds under present intellectual property laws, including the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act. The Government has therefore asked officials to consider whether it would be possible to frame legislation which addresses the Games organisers' concerns in this area, without having unintended application to acceptable activities. The New South Wales Government and Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games will be consulted in the development of the legislation and will be able to assist the Government in attempting to frame appropriate legislation. Should the Government decide to include a provision related to this recommendation, the Australian Paralympic Federation will be treated in the same manner as other "Sydney Games Bodies".</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. That the special measures recommended in Recommendations 5, 6 and 7 cease to have effect after 30 June 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that the legislation should have a fixed term of effect. Official sponsors will be granted rights to indicia associated with the Games until 31 December 2000. As the intention of the legislation is to boost the sponsorship revenue by giving sponsors confidence that their rights are protected, the legislation becomes redundant when the sponsors cease to have those rights. The Government therefore intends that the legislation will cease to have effect on 31 December 2000.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. Appropriately drafted exemptions be provided in any legislative measures to protect the Olympic words and symbols. Exemptions should permit the continued use of designations lawfully used prior to the enactment of the legislation, for press reportage and for dissemination of factual information relating to the services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. There will also be an exemption to allow for "criticism and review" of the Games and provision for exemption for sporting organisations to be implemented if the SOCOG does not meet their reasonable needs for promotion and fundraising through the preparation of memoranda of understanding. Effective and targeted tourism and marketing activities that complement the activities of the SOCOG will play an important part in ensuring an effective Sydney Games. If further investigation shows that memoranda of understanding between tourism bodies and the SOCOG are appropriate, similar provision for the implementation of exemptions if the tourism bodies' reasonable needs are not met would be required. The terms of such memoranda (or exemption) will have to take account of the terms of the Host City Contract.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. That the exemption for existing users of affected marks be lost if the marks are not used commercially for a period of 6 months to one year. That the exemption for existing users extend only to the use of the words and marks in the same class as the goods currently used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed in principle. The provisions should be consistent with the Trade Marks Act. The exemption for existing users should extend to the use of the affected marks in respect of the same goods or services as those currently traded under the mark, and in respect of goods or services similar to those currently traded under the mark. Users of affected marks will need to show cause why they should not lose the right to the affected mark if it has not been used commercially for three years. The exemption will apply only to where use commenced prior to 28 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. That the exemption provided for the dissemination of information by businesses advertising factual statements of services in connection with the Games but not so as to imply or give the impression of an official sponsorship connection where none exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. That freedom of political communication be ensured.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. That additional measures be taken under the Customs Act to seek to limit the possibility of the importation of goods which inappropriately seek to ambush market the Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed. Controls under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations or the Customs Act, while to the commercial advantage of a limited number of licensed entrepreneurs, would be extremely intrusive to legitimate importers by retarding the movement of cargo, as well as being resource intensive and expensive to administer. The Government considers that appropriate new Customs measures based on comparable provisions in the trade marks and copyright legislation should be implemented in the proposed new legislation. The expressions proposed to be protected under this legislation consist of elements of trade marks and copyright matter and should be subject to similar controls.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. That appropriate planning and training exercises be developed for Customs Officers and any relevant State Government agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agreed. Customs and other Commonwealth and State Government agencies must be provided with appropriate training once enforcement requirements have been identified. Responsibility for provision of the training should be determined at that time also.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. The Committee recommends the amendment of the Olympic Insignia Protection Act to extend the protection of the proposed expanded list of protected words as requested by the AOC, but subject to appropriate exemptions for existing users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not agreed. The Government accepts the need to provide protection of certain words and symbols, in order to protect the revenue of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. It does not, however, consider it appropriate that there be any further extension of the protection available under that Act to protect names or abbreviations of the names International Olympic Committee (IOC) or Australian Olympic Committee (AOC). The Government will, however, consult further with the AOC and SOCOG regarding the protection of the words "Olympic", "Olympiad" and "Olympic Games" for the period up to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. The Committee recommends that the SOCOG monitor applications for trade marks internationally to object to ones which breach the Games organisers' rights in the Olympic words and symbols.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes that this recommendation is directed at the SOCOG. Australian individuals and organisations would have no right to object to the application for trade marks under another country's legislation. Even if overseas companies were to obtain trade marks, none of the goods produced as a result could be imported into Australia if they breached the Australian legislation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. The Committee recommends that the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee monitor the implementation of the specific legislation once enacted. The Committee should consider whether the legislation is having any unintended consequences on business and whether additional measures should be introduced. The Committee should receive its reference two years before the Sydney Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of references to the Committee is a matter for the Senate. While the Government would have no objection to this proposal, it reserves the right to act earlier if the need becomes apparent.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Harradine made some excellent comments in the second reading debate about a taxpayer being able to seek redress through the common law. The government is claiming it wants to remove the right to seek sales tax refunds at common law. We believe that the right to seek refunds of tax is enshrined in the common law of Australia. It is a right that is not given or granted by government but is a right accepted by the people as being just. Taxpayers should only ever be required to pay the level of tax imposed by parliament. Taxpayers must always be able to enforce that right. The possibility of an action to recover moneys paid as tax where no tax was payable prevents the unjust enrichment of the revenue authorities. The possibility of the action is important to ensure that revenue authorities are only able to retain that which the parliament has determined they may collect. I ask the government: why is it moving this way, why now, and why sales tax only?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is opposing the amendment moved by Senator Gibson. I am not sure what the other parties in the chamber are doing about this but I hope they will see the merit of the government's position and, when it comes to the point, vote against the opposition's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition proposes to remove the provision that would limit refunds to those grounds specified in the sales tax law. The need for the amendment which this legislation is proposing has arisen because several actions have been commenced seeking refunds of sales tax under the common law. The litigants who have commenced these actions have done so because they are unable to satisfy the normal conditions for obtaining a refund under the sales tax law, especially the passing-on rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major factor in the decision to propose these amendments was to prevent windfall gains that could arise by litigants avoiding the passing-on rules. In situations where the taxpayer&mdash;that is, the manufacturer or wholesaler&mdash;otherwise would benefit at the expense of his or her customers, the government considers it preferable that the gains should be retained by the government to be applied for public purposes rather than contributing to the profit of the wholesaler or manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The refund provisions are subject to certain conditions. One condition is that the passing-on rule has been satisfied&mdash;that is, that the cost of the tax has been borne by the taxpayer or claimant or, if it was recovered from the taxpayer's customers, has been refunded to them. This condition is a longstanding feature of the sales tax law. Without it, taxpayers claiming a refund could make a windfall gain since they could have recovered the tax once from their customers and again from the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another condition is that the applications for refunds must be made within three years of the overpayment. This condition corresponds to a similar restriction on the commissioner whereby he is generally unable to collect sales tax properly payable more than three years after it was due. This is to provide certainty for taxpayers that their past taxation obligations have been settled and certainty for the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the government's proposal does not alter any rights that consumers have against the government. The amendments remove the rights that sales taxpayers&mdash;that is, wholesalers and manufacturers&mdash;may have against the government, since they are the ones who are liable to pay sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the reasons the government has advanced for these amendments to the legislation. I wanted those reasons to be clearly on the record. I apologise to Senator Gibson that I did not note all his questions. I may have answered some of them by making a more detailed explanation. I may not have; I suspect the latter is true. If it is, please ask your questions again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to detail for the record the decision of the High Court in the Royal Insurance Australia case because it is an important matter, as the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) acknowledged. I made a number of points in principle in my speech this morning which go to the very heart of parliamentary democracy, the equality of rights of citizens under the law and the duty of parliament to uphold those rights against the Crown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this matter is that the High Court in the Royal Insurance Australia case has held that a taxing act confers no authority upon the commissioner to levy, demand or retain any moneys otherwise than in payment of duties and charges imposed by or pursuant to the act. This is plain commonsense. As I pointed out in my speech this morning, if it were otherwise, we would be back to the days of taxation by royal prerogative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that there is a statutory scheme for refunds of sales tax but this statutory scheme is subject to limitations, as honourable senators know. A major limitation is that the wholesale sales taxpayer must satisfy the commissioner that he either bore the overpaid tax or, if passed on to him by another, has refunded that tax. In other words, the sales taxpayer has no economic interest in most circumstances in challenging any wrongful decision of the Taxation Office. Who would go to the expense of litigation to get a refund for somebody else?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation makes a choice as to who is the taxpayer, namely, the wholesaler. It does not prescribe a scheme for passing on tax, although the economic influences will usually, but not always, generate such a result. If the legislation does not prescribe such a scheme for passing on the tax, it seems curious that there would be a scheme for passing on refunds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider what really happens in practice. The commissioner decides that something is no longer exempt or is now taxable at a different, higher classification. He then demands tax from wholesalers. They have two choices: they can accede to his demands and pay; or they can refuse to pay. If they refuse to pay, he can seize their cash flow by garnisheeing their debtors and send them bankrupt. This occurred in the Brayson Motors case&mdash;the Taxation Office sent them bankrupt. The commissioner can force them into liquidation before the courts have finally adjudicated on whether any sales tax is owing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very important point for honourable senators to focus upon: the taxation commissioner can force a company into liquidation before the courts have finally adjudicated on whether any sales tax is owing. In the Brayson Motors case, the taxpayer was put into liquidation and later on the High Court held that no tax was payable. The taxpayer had no legal right to compensation for the damage caused to his business because the commissioner had acted within his statutory powers in garnisheeing its cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with the Brayson Motors precedent, few taxpayers would refuse to pay any sales tax demanded by the commissioner no matter how vigorously they disagreed with his interpretation of the law and no matter how wrong-headed the commissioner's opinion might be. From a commercial point of view, they would have no choice; they would cave in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having paid, they may litigate the matter. It may be years before the courts finally decide the matter and, if the courts decide in favour of the taxpayer, the commissioner will then seek to use the statutory scheme for refunds to deprive the taxpayer of any benefit from his challenge. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Many taxpayers will not be able to prove either that they bore the tax or that they passed on refunds. Anybody that has been in business, as Senator Boswell has, would know that elementary fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands of transactions may have occurred and they are expected to set up an administrative apparatus to refund moneys to customers who may have gone out of business, moved on or been lost track of. Effectively, therefore, the sales tax payer, unlike the income tax payer, is placed in a position where it is virtually pointless to challenge a wrong decision by the Commissioner of Taxation. This means that in practice the Taxation Office can, to a large extent, impose taxation without parliamentary approval&mdash;and that is the nub of it&mdash;because nobody will challenge him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only cases where it is likely that somebody might challenge him could be where a wholesaler is a subsidiary of a large retailer. I raised a number of questions in the estimates committee about this matter and honourable senators may have had the opportunity of perusing the responses that came from the Commissioner of Taxation. In answer to these questions, the Taxation Office argued that the conditions on refunds do not allow the commissioner to be unjustly enriched. Rather they are designed to prevent the taxpayer from recovering the relevant tax twice: firstly, in the sales price; and, secondly, by way of unfettered refund from the Commonwealth. This answer clearly misses the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If no-one has an economic interest in challenging the commissioner and is thus deterred from doing so, the commissioner is unjustly enriched because he has taken money without parliamentary authority by levying an unlawful tax. If that is not unjust enrichment of the revenue, I don't know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being ignored by the Taxation Office is that where a taxpayer recovers money under common law, that taxpayer is equally open to a claim by its customers for restitution in appropriate cases. That has been made clear by the High Court&mdash;the Taxation Office knows that. It is a matter between themselves and the fact that they may have rights between themselves is no excuse for the commissioner to avoid his liability to refund moneys unlawfully taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, I note that we are dealing with trade practices in the competition policy bill. There is no reason why, in an appropriate case, the Trade Practices Commission in its expanded form could not take action to assist third parties to assert their claims to shares of refunds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It lies ill in the mouth of someone who has extorted money unlawfully to argue that he should not have to give it back because, really, it belongs to somebody else. That is what the Commissioner of Taxation is saying. He has extorted the money and his argument is, `We are not going to give it back to the wholesaler because it belongs to somebody, or it might belong to somebody else.' That argument is not accepted in the case of ordinary theft and I see no reason why it should be any more acceptable here. If I cannot refuse to give back money when a mortgage repayment is demanded because the money really belongs to the depositors, why should the commissioner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious matter of principle and it is one in which the parliament itself is entitled to exercise its decision to ensure that the Commissioner of Taxation is not in effect permitted to retain taxes which are then seen to have been unlawfully garnered. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment before the committee is one to knock out schedule 9 of this bill. It is worthwhile looking at what schedule 9 does and what its removal would imply. As I read schedule 9 in relation to the rest of the bill, this relates to areas where the taxpayer has overpaid the amount of taxation due to him or her and wishes to seek recovery. We are talking about wholesale sales tax. So the taxpayer in this case is the wholesaler or the manufacturer and that wholesaler or manufacturer is working under a system of self-assessment. That is, they assess for themselves the right level of taxation and pay it. Usually, having done that, the standard practice is for them to pass on to their customers who are retailers the cost of taxation embedded in the final price of the product that they sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where that has occurred, they have recovered the cost to them of paying, in this case, more tax than they ought to have paid. The question is, having recovered that, whether they should have the right of a further action to recover it again from the Commissioner of Taxation. The amendment says, in effect, that those who have recovered it once cannot recover it twice. On that basis, there would be general agreement that it cannot be recovered twice. That model of explanation sits reasonably. No-one would uphold the principle of double recovery. So far so good. No-one has nodded their head, but everybody is looking searchingly at me. I take that as leave to continue to the next stage. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the point of the amendment. That is why I am trying to make the point as clearly and succinctly as I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is that, assuming the manufacturer or wholesaler has passed on a higher than necessary tax payment to the retailer, and assuming that the retailer has passed that to another manufacturer and it goes all the way through to the customer, is there a right of the individual customer to recover? That is more along the lines of what Senator Harradine is talking about. The assumption underpinning this argument is that there is fair transmittal through the process to the customer and the ultimate consumer and that the ultimate consumer picks up the full tab. I do not think in all honesty that argument can be sustained as being what happens in a working economy. I will give an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Automotive component manufacturers, as wholesalers, may sell their manufactured goods to General Motors, Toyota, Ford, Mitsubishi or another manufacturer of vehicles. They put the products into their motor vehicle and sell to retailers, who then sell to customers. How would one differentiate the right of the individual consumer to recover the cost? Can one assume that at each stage of the transmittal the full cost has been passed on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is interesting, and a worthwhile example for this reason. We have a contestable motor vehicle industry in Australia. The major four producers compete with one another over price, quality and after sales service. Price is an important part of that competition. No-one can be sure, for example, that General Motors has not absorbed part of the cost of the original componentry in its profit margin in order to win market share. One cannot at each stage track this perfectly or be sure what has been decided at each stage of the process. In the end, we cannot be sure of the consumer rights, if there is such a thing as consumer rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a contestable manufacturing market in Australia. Individual wholesalers or manufacturers are in a market in which they are contesting in their field with other individual wholesalers or manufacturers. The issue of price often concerns whether it is absorbed now or at the next stage of the process. I do not understand how anyone can be sure about identifying what the real cost in these circumstances might be and what the right of the individual consumer might be, if there is one, let alone how a bureaucracy is expected to divine this fact. All I can say, therefore, is that the fairest way of doing it is the way we have proposed to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tried to follow Senator Harradine's intervention in great detail. It was a considered intervention. He referred in part to a situation where there has been an underpayment of wholesale sales tax and an action by the tax officer to recover that underpayment. It is not for me to contend with him in terms of whether the Taxation Office sent someone under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first principle I would base my case on is that there is an obligation on all taxpayers, whosoever they are, to pay the full and correct amount of taxation. If someone has not and there is a claim, the normal process at the Taxation Office is to ask for 50 per cent of what is in contest, not the whole amount, while the argument is being resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that to be the normal process, which is a reasonable one, given that a fundamental obligation of the Taxation Office is that the Taxation Office should be seen like the statue we see on top of courts: it should be blindfolded, with a sword in one hand and a scale in the other. It should recover the full amount of tax fairly across the board from everybody and not make special exceptions. As soon as a special exception is made, all other taxpayers who are paying the full freight will ask, `If they can get away with it, why do we have to pay the full amount?' The whole principle of taxation then becomes unravelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to the point of Senator Harradine's intervention as I understood it. Where a taxpayer has underpaid, there is recovery afoot by the Commissioner of Taxation and there is a contest as to what the right amount might be, the habit of the Taxation Office is to ask for 50 per cent of that until the issue is settled.

Nonetheless, the government has an obligation to have a system of payment which is fair and which applies equally to everybody.

I have tried to explain the government's case as clearly and succinctly as I am able. I will differentiate this amendment from the argument that Senator Harradine has put. In terms of this amendment, where there has been an overpayment of tax, the principle here is that taxpayers who have overpaid and have had a recovery effected so that their overpayment is neutralised ought not be able to recover again and thus achieve two recoveries. Therefore, a wholesaler who has passed on the cost should not be able to recover against the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A wholesaler who has passed on the cost and has then returned the extra cost passed on to customers so that the customer is not affected has a case to recover from the Taxation Office. Wholesalers who have not passed on their tax have a case to recover from the Taxation Office. But wholesalers who have passed on their tax and been rewarded ought not be able to recover. That is the issue that is being debated here. That is why the government sticks with its position. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine asked whether or not there is any common law right by an individual consumer. I have some notes which are worthwhile referring to. There is doubt as to whether the common law right that it is alleged we propose to take away does, in fact, exist. The amendment arises because of the government's desire to clarify the situation and to put it beyond doubt. By not taking away this right it might be, depending on whether the right actually exists, that the wholesaler can recover from the government. </PARA>

Litigation will increase as you go down the chain. If we consider how complex this chain might be, I am not sure that at any stage of that chain a court could reasonably make a judgement about what part is passed or what part is absorbed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pursue this matter a little further. I thought the minister's intervention was largely absolutely correct, with the exception of the last bit about there not being a common law right of the customer, whether that customer be the retailer or the end consumer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I just want to thank the minister for pointing out the obvious. First of all, the wholesaler, as the minister said, is the one that pays the sales tax. Not, as the minister said, in the manner of self-assessment, willy nilly, but it is assessment on the basis of what is regarded as his or her legal obligation. I will come to that again in a minute. So the wholesaler is liable to pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the minister is saying is, in this period of competition, particularly as we are entering a further period of competition, how can anyone know that that wholesaler has passed on to the retailer the full percentage of the taxation that that wholesaler has paid to the Taxation Commissioner? With respect, that is an argument for accepting the amendment moved by Senator Gibson. What the minister is saying now is that we should abolish the common law right of the wholesaler to claim a refund unless that wholesaler can prove that he has passed on, or will pass on, that amount to the retailer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, what the minister is saying is that proof, in many cases, is going to be impossible because of the operation of the competitive nature of various businesses. But why, then, Minister, should the taxation department hang on to tax money that has been unlawfully garnered from the wholesaler? That is the point. I come back to what the High Court said in the Royal Insurance case, and we must really have regard to this because it is a major question of law and equality before the law. The High Court decision says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tax Act confers no authority upon the Commissioner to levy, demand or retain any moneys otherwise than in payment of duties and charges imposed by or pursuant to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>If the wholesaler has assessed his taxation liability to the tax office at a particular level and the Commissioner of Taxation later makes a determination that that is not the appropriate level, it should be a higher level and he should have been paying that higher level over a period of years, and if ultimately that is proved to be wrong, you are saying by this legislation that, although the court has determined that that was an unlawful enrichment of the tax office, the tax office can pocket that money and not refund it as it is required to do under the law as it exists. </PARA>

A lot of this goes back to that first announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the principle of access to common law for overpayment is an important principle. I recognise that common law claims for refunds could allow payers of wholesale sales tax, as the minister has said, to obtain a windfall. It is a terrible dilemma. I seriously wish the tax office would present to us some options which deal with this problem, because it has been an ongoing one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government is anticipating what some accountants have hinted they might be able to do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the amendment is going to pass. I think Senator Gibson's position will hold, irrespective of what we might do. I urge the tax office to come up with some serious options for dealing with this, rather than denying access to common law claims. Senator Margetts's amendment, which will come later, requires greater publicity of what we are doing here. Publicising the fact that this is a disallowable instrument will actually go a long way to alerting consumers of their rights and responsibilities. What the minister has said is very persuasive. Doing something in anticipation of what accountants might do, given my views on them, is a little dangerous. </PARA>

<PARA>I did not give detailed reasons for the way the Greens voted on the last amendment, so I will explain them now. It was a complex decision because obviously there were elements within the government's representations which were extremely attractive. It appeared that a major concern was for the protection of the taxpayer, and the ability to guard against at least one form of unjust enrichment&mdash;that is, on behalf the wholesaler in collecting, but not passing on, wholesales sales tax to the government. In the case where there was no lawful collection of sales tax, the attraction was in relation to avoiding some group in an unjust enrichment. That led us to look at why this might be the case and what might be one method by which this is less likely to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, in the case of tax, knowledge is a very powerful thing. It is very important. One thing that has been missing in a lot of cases is people being able to find out exactly when taxes come in, to what degree they are liable, and where they can obtain information about their liability, or perhaps remedies, in the case of overpaid tax. That is why, on balance, our decision was to continue to support the current common law remedies until&mdash;and this may never happen&mdash;a case can be put to us at some stage that it is better to override the current common law remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for this amendment arose from discussions with consumers and consumer groups and from letters from constituents concerning the difficulties in understanding the application of new sales tax changes, particularly when they have a retrospective commencement date. As a consequence, we are proposing an amendment to this bill that will require the Treasurer to publish information for taxpayers in major newspapers outlining: firstly, the intent of the government with respect to the law or change in law; secondly, details of the proposal and how and when it is to be applied; thirdly, whether the proposal is subject to enactment or disallowance; and, fourthly, the details of any hotlines or information sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not feel that this is an onerous requirement on the Treasurer, but it will assist the community at large&mdash;including consumers, retailers and wholesalers&mdash;in understanding these often complex issues that affect our daily lives. I look forward to support from all sides of parliament for this issue. It is unfortunate that the government has indicated that it is not prepared to support the legal requirement of provision of information to taxpayers on new sales tax. I would really like to know on what rationale the government could justify its not wishing to support a requirement that taxpayers be advised of new tax requirements, once they are announced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said previously, the Australian Democrats think that these are excellent amendments. I think the Consumers Association would be really pleased to see this. Why would the government say that this could not be done? In an age of incredible complexity and requirements on citizens to comply with laws we are passing, it seems to me a very simple and basic thing to say, `Here is information which will assist you to comply with laws.' We spend so much money telling everybody about all the inquiries and committee hearings we are having and seeking submissions. This is an initiation of the process of saying, `Here is information which you need to use to fulfil other requirements.' I think it is an excellent idea.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Margetts; however, the government supports the principle of providing as much information as possible about the detail of a proposed change when it is announced. The government confirmed this in its reply to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>, which was delivered on 8 August 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has met its commitment in relation to sales tax; for example, all the legislation to support the sales tax changes announced in the budget on 9 May 1995 was introduced into the parliament the same night. In addition, there was a series of press releases which explained the changes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am part-way through these dot points. From the following day, there was a hotline number which taxpayers or other interested people could call to get further details. This number is listed in the phone book. This goes on the Aristotelian scale of further upping the importance of each step. The tax office has since issued two detailed sales tax bulletins explaining how certain aspects of the changes would apply if passed by parliament. It turns out that, amongst all this activity, the government might not have adequately addressed all the needs of the consumers&mdash;at least that seems to be the view of the Greens. Having had this pointed out, we will address it in the normal course of our desire to get details out as soon as possible following announcements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not appropriate to amend the law to place a requirement on the government relating to consumer information in this way. It will not be necessary in every case of a change for details to be widely advertised. To do so every time would impose unnecessary costs. I think that that is probably the main point of the government's position. There are a number of these changes, and if we had to advertise every change in several newspapers in every capital around Australia, it would impose an extra cost and an oversupply of information which dilutes the ability of the community to absorb. It is better that the tax office direct its bulletins to those people who are affected rather than broadcast more widely, because there are a number of these changes and the whole thing would be made a mockery of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed provision in the law does not provide the desirable flexibility, as different changes may demand different information. The provision will not necessarily provide the desired certainty, as the provision could be repealed. An important issue in relation to the drafting of the amendment is that the notice requirement will apply to all bills that are proposed to operate prior to the bills' enactment. There may be situations where a proposal is announced to operate from a future date and it turns out, due to the uncertainties of the parliamentary process&mdash;which is putting it nicely&mdash;that this date is before the bill's royal assent. In such a case, it would not be clear that such a proposal should fit into the proposed regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also needing to be clarified is what details of the bill are necessary to be included. In cases where the proposed commencement is a future date, full details might not have been worked out. That is the summary of the government's position. It encodes in law a well-meaning principle, but then binds the law in an inflexible way which defeats the principle. It is far better, in our view, to target the particular groups who have an interest in this law rather than a broad brush encoding of legislation which works against better understanding and information. By doing it when the legislation is introduced does not mean to say that it will be the shape of the legislation when it is given royal assent. It creates confusion. The government opposes the amendments. </PARA>

The tax agents are becoming richer and richer because of the lack of information available to people. The taxpack is deceptively simple, but information with regard to the taxpack is largely owned by fewer and fewer people. We are trying to reverse that trend to enable the changes to the sales tax legislation to be advised. It is a very good incentive for government to try and get it right.

<PARA>I acknowledge that Senator Kernot and her party and the coalition have been critical of the eight per cent uplift factor and that we have both submitted amendments for moving it down to six per cent. The government has set the provisional uplift factor for next year at eight per cent. While this is an improvement on the current situation, the coalition does not believe that the government has gone far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provisional tax is calculated on the previous year's taxable income plus an uplift factor. The uplift factor is a major burden to small businesses as it detrimentally affects their cash flow, being a payment of tax in anticipation of future earnings. It is difficult to see any reason for the rate being set at eight per cent when the forecast for the CPI is less that half of that. What possible reason could there be for setting such a high uplift factor. I can perhaps supply an answer. I understand that for each one per cent increase in the uplift factor the government raises an extra $100 million. I think that is what it is all about. In the coalition's view eight per cent is unfair. We have proposed six per cent for next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in passing that the Institute of Chartered Accountants has surveyed 1,000 of its members representing 95,000-odd small business clients of whom a very high proportion&mdash;71,000&mdash;pay provisional tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask the minister what the government's response is to the fact that the Taxation Office acknowledges that the reality is that at an individual taxpayer level there will probably be a greater number of people who will be below the average and far fewer who will be in excess of the average of the uplift factor. In other words, it is a fact that rates at which the provisional uplift factor have been set since 1991 have resulted in the tax office never having lost any net provisional tax revenue. The tax office has had a considerable benefit from the uplift factor being far too high on the average of the past three years. Can the minister tell me why any benefits that accrue because of the setting of the tax uplift factor should go to the tax office rather than to individual Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens are inclined to support a more realistic uplift factor; that is, six per cent rather than eight per cent. However, we are also inclined to provide some degree of certainty unless and until the point where the government can provide a good argument otherwise. There is some attraction in supporting  six per cent but, by the same token, we believe that making this decision each year provides less certainty, unless there is some reason why there will be substantial changes from year to year that require that the uplift factor has to be decided each year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we are inclined to support the lowering of the uplift factor, but at the same time have some interest in waiting until the parliament decides next time. That means it is still possible for the parliament to change the rate next year if there was a circumstance that changed so much that it was necessary to change that uplift factor. To give some degree of certainty, it means that people do know what the level will be, at least until the parliament decides next time. We are inclined to support the lowering but at the same time are inclined to support that element of Senator Kernot's amendment which indicates that until further notice, that is what the uplift factor will be. To clarify that, if it is possible to support both, we will support the element of reducing the uplift factor; if the committee allows that amendment by Senator Kernot to be split later, perhaps we would support part (b). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support this amendment. I am not going to break my losing streak here because, given the expressions of view around the chamber, the government will be defeated on this. We will take it back to the House in due course and this time we will bring it back here. I am pretty sure of that. Like Senator Kernot, we referred to this matter in the debate on the second reading. I do not wish to canvass all the arguments again. The government is on the record as to why it sets the uplift factor as it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the question that I have from Senator Ferguson&mdash;this may well go to some of the arguments that have been put as well&mdash;we do not set the uplift factor in any sense on the basis of trying to give the tax office a windfall gain by artificially inflating the uplift factor in order to gain more revenue. The reason we set an uplift factor on the forecasts based by Treasury as to what the expected growth in business earnings will be is to pick the right point in the market. In no sense are we trying to manipulate a figure. The forecasting process is transparent and open, as it should be, and the issue is to get it right. The fact that when it is right, the opposition does not agree with it, is a point of argument. But the forecasting is fair and reasonable, transparent and open and based on all the matters that ought to be considered, and it is made by Treasury. The tax office then takes note of it and sets the uplift factor appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: we are not in the business of trying to soak taxpayers to make a windfall gain. We would not do that and we should not do that. If we were doing that, you would not let us do it, and nor should you. This is not a situation like that at all, although sometimes, for political purposes, it is argued that it is. In our heart of hearts we recognise that it is not. For those reasons, I oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The department's forecasting has been wrong. For three years in a row the collections have been higher than they ought to be. The rate has been set at eight per cent for the past two years, so it is obvious that whatever method it is using for forecasting, it is wrong. I notice that one of the tax office submissions to the committee&mdash;I quoted it this morning&mdash;even uses long-range weather forecasting. I know lots of farmers who have tried to use long-range weather forecasting to try to accurately predict what their future incomes will be, and over the past three or four years they have not worked out too well. But the fact is that the forecasting is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been wrong in 1991-92, wrong the next year and wrong the next year by setting the rate too high, why does the government persist in setting it at the same level again this year, presuming that it is using the same economic indicators? The minister said that the government is not looking for a win-win situation against the taxpayer. In fact, for three years in a row it has been win, win, win. The people who have been paying provisional tax and paying the uplift factor in general terms have been paying more than they are required to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the uplift factor does not mean that at the end of the day anybody pays more tax than that person is actually liable for. At the end of the day you only ever pay the tax that you are actually liable for. It is all a matter of timing. That timing is impacting on small businesses&mdash;particularly a number of small businesses that have made approaches to us&mdash;very badly when they are in tough economic times. If they are paying more tax by way of provisional tax, which includes the uplift factor, than they are liable for, it is putting that added pressure on them and it means that somehow or other the forecasting is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that we can never get over this situation where, under the current system, some people who actually have a big increase in income from a variety of different industries&mdash;I know it happens because you are using one factor to cover a whole range of industries&mdash;have a windfall gain. Right now there are more people who are having losses than there are having gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either the forecasting method is wrong or the government, on advice, is setting the rate at too high a level. I personally believe that even at six per cent the rate is too high, but I am aware of the impact that it has on government revenue. Even by bringing it down to six per cent this year, it will have a considerable impact on revenue. We as a coalition said last year that we could go along with an eight per cent uplift factor but that we would put the government on notice that it should consider it in the next year and that we would be prepared to vote in favour of lowering the uplift factor if all the facts and figures that were presented to us suggested that it had been too high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we have had good enough evidence over the past two years to show that that eight per cent uplift factor&mdash;I think it was 10 per cent the year before; I may stand corrected&mdash;was too high. The indications are that it is still too high. I think that the Democrats and the coalition are being fair-minded in suggesting that we are signalling a decrease in the uplift factor. I do not think it is going as low as it should, but I think six per cent is what we would call a reasonable amount for the uplift factor to be decreased to in order that it does not have too great an impact on revenue and still has some sympathy for the predicament that small businesses and individuals who are actually paying provisional tax, including the uplift factor, find themselves in. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the provisional tax uplift factor is concerned, it is all to do with timing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that one recommendation is considered a rather radical suggestion. It talks about individual provisional uplift factors, but we have individual averaging for lots of others things with partnerships as well. It is a rather radical view but I think it is one worth investigating, because somehow at the end of the day we want to do what is best for the taxpayer; to make it simpler for him, so that there is some more surety. I am concerned about what is best for the taxpayer, what is best for small business and the impact this will have on small business. </PARA>

I think we ought to give the government a chance to respond to this committee report and some of the recommendations which are somewhat radical and different. Surely at some stage in the future we can then look at putting into place a mechanism which is far better than the current provisional tax uplift factor mechanism that we work under. </PARA>

<PARA>I canvassed some of these arguments in the second reading debate. I am concerned to ensure that, in moving to the higher company tax rate, the impact on smaller companies is done in the fairest possible way. We recognise that smaller companies face compliance costs that are much higher than those of big business, but we think that, while 36 per cent might be reasonable, we have to make sure that the way in which it is collected is as fair as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Gibson pointed out in some of his comments, the original reduction in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent was funded by the bringing forward of company tax instalment times. Medium sized companies with a tax liability of $8,000 to $300,000 were moved to a quarterly payment system, with the first payment due brought forward from 28 September to 1 June. Then we had the last payment brought forward from 15 February to 1 February. Small companies balancing in June had until 15 February and then, after 1993, this was brought forward to 1 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proposing that it is time to review this payment timing schedule for small companies. I am proposing in item (c) that the payment time be put back from 1 December to 1 February. For medium companies, we propose in item (b) that the quarterly payments commence on 30 June rather than 1 June. As I said before, these amendments do not reduce at all the amount of tax payable, but give small business a little more time to get what can be chaotic affairs in order. In discussing these with the small business coalition, it certainly was of the view that they are not earth-shatteringly huge in their impact, but that they are helpful and they are a step forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was speaking to my amendment to change payment dates. I was speaking about the effect it would have on medium sized companies. The effect of this is to ensure that a medium sized company is not required to pay its first instalment until the last day of the financial year and that fact recognises that companies sort out their income on a very different basis from PAYE taxpayers. For small companies, we propose delaying the date of payment from 1 December to 1 February. If we look at what has happened already this year, we see that a lot of small businesses and their tax agents are saying that the new tax system has proved quite difficult for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office has responded. It has agreed to put back the lodgment date of tax returns from 1 December to 1 February, but it still wants the money on 1 December. So it is a kind of Clayton's concession. That tax office action recognises that small companies are having difficulty meeting the earlier deadline, but the tax office is constrained from offering any further relief. So these amendments would do something the commissioner cannot do&mdash;that is, put back the date of payment to the date of lodgment of 1 February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in relation to the thresholds, item A of my amendment seeks to increase the threshold for small companies from a tax liability of $8,000 to a tax liability of $10,000&mdash;it used to be $20,000 under One Nation. As I have said previously, the fact that it was reduced to $8,000 was part of the bringing forward of repayment times needed to pay for the tax rate cut in 1993. I accept that it is too expensive to move back to $20,000 in one hit, but this is an affordable first step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about very big companies; we are talking about very small companies&mdash;$24,000 is not a big operation at all. The object of allowing for a small companies category is to allow companies with small incomes to make only one payment. That should suit the tax office in the same way it would suit the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In not doing this, though, we should be aware of one of the consequences&mdash;that is, around 5,000 companies are being forced to move from a single payment to a quarterly payment system. Their first payment would become due on 1 June rather than 1 December. That would be very inconvenient and add significantly to compliance costs. In general, we should be moving towards more reasonable thresholds. The measure would defer about $9 million of income from 1995-96 to 1996-97 and about $31,000 from 1996-97 to 1997-98, after which it would be revenue neutral. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go to the briefing note. Firstly, the tax issues of greatest concern to small business have been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate economics references committee. The reference: improving the tax treatment of small business. The government is committed to responding to that report, therefore, it is appropriate to consider the committee's findings before deciding on any amendments to the taxation of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, if the intention of the proposed amendments, as it seems to be, is to relieve small business of some of the costs of doing business, the proposed rescheduling may not be the best method of achieving that objective, because `small business', `small companies' and `companies paying small amounts of tax' are all different groups. Indeed, most small businesses, particularly those at the lower end of the total business income scale, are not incorporated and, therefore, would not benefit from special treatment for taxpaying companies. Furthermore, companies with small income tax liabilities may not be small businesses in terms of their accounting&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I make one more point on this&mdash;and I will save time. Then you get into an argument about subsidiaries of large companies and the possibility of large companies organising their subsidiaries to qualify. That is another consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the threshold, the current $8,000 threshold was set to achieve the appropriate balance between efficiency and equity considerations favouring quarterly instalments and the desire to minimise compliance in administration costs involved in collecting relatively small amounts of tax. This balance is not affected by the fact that the increase in the company tax rate may change the classification of some companies from small to medium. Eight thousand is still a sufficiently large sum to warrant quarterly payments to spread the cost to the taxpayer of the tax liability. The same threshold applies for provisional tax quarterly instalments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not support the amendment because it would be most appropriate to judge the extent of small business interest in this proposal by considering the report from the inquiry of the economics committee and it would shift some $20 million of revenue collections from medium to small companies, some of which the first instalments otherwise payable by medium companies would be shifted from the 1995-96 financial year to the 1996-97 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the government does not support the proposed amendment to 1A(b) is that it is estimated that $620 million would be shifted from the 1995-96 to the 1996-97 financial year. The franking credits for the payment of the first instalment for normal balancing medium companies may not arise until a subsequent franking year and companies would be unable to frank dividends in anticipation of payment of that instalment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed rescheduling would exacerbate the advantage of medium companies over provisional taxpayers, with similar tax liabilities, whose provisional tax may be due on 31 March of the current income year. This would undermine one of the reasons for the introduction of the company tax instalment regime which is to provide tax symmetry between incorporated and unincorporated businesses. This is of particular concern in relation to companies that are used as tax minimisation vehicles by wealthy individuals and families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the proposed amendment to paragraph 1A(c). This amendment would defer the payment of tax by small companies by three months. The government considers this amendment unnecessary and does not support it. The same argument applies. The proposed rescheduling would exacerbate the advantage of small companies over provisional taxpayers and it would undermine one of the reasons for the introduction of the company tax instalment regime. As I recall, under the proposal Senator Kernot has put forward, 30 June next year is a Sunday. That would mean that they would pay tax in the next financial year. </PARA>

Sometimes we accept thresholds without asking why they are there. When other circumstances change, I think we should ask why they are there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995 and to ask the Minister representing the Treasurer (Senator Cook) certain questions. In my speech in the second reading debate I referred to the removal of the tax exemption from EPROMs in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out to Senator Cook in that debate that that tax exemption will affect the only two phone companies remaining in Australia that manufacture and design in Australia. I also pointed out to him that the huge multi-million dollar market of mobile phones is being shared by Nokia, which is owned by the Finland government, and Motorola, which is an American company. I estimate that they would have something like 90 per cent of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pointed out in that speech that the phones being sold at the moment are either subsidised by Optus and Telecom, which I cannot exactly prove, or perhaps dumped by Motorola and Nokia. I know that it would be almost impossible to get a phone on the market for around $200 and meet costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Optus and Telecom are not selling phones; they are selling access to the network. It is putting pressure on the smaller companies&mdash;the Australian companies&mdash;and excluding them from a very lucrative and vast Australian market.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption on sales tax on the EPROMs gave them an advantage that kept them in the market. As I said before, the minister is a very successful promoter of Australian industry. He comes in here and talks it up; that is his job. I know that everyone in the Senate wants to see Australia on the cutting edge of advancing technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in this industry for 20 years. Most of the products that I sold, which were ordinary manufactured products that went into a retail market, are now being imported from overseas. Virtually everything that I sold during those 20 years that I was in the industry&mdash;this was before I came into this place&mdash;has now been replaced by imports. The one area in which Australia can and must do well is high technology. By the removal of this sales tax exemption, the government has put at risk the development of the high-tech industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible to buy a floppy disk which will have no sales tax on it. But the new technology&mdash;the EPROMs&mdash;which is the new age method of storing information, will now have tax on it. So the old way of doing things will be tax exempt and the new way of doing things will attract sales tax. In the minister's second reading speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ministers&mdash;and I speak for Minister Lee and me in this&mdash;are committed to ensuring that a strategy is in place so that Australia is well placed to capture the emerging opportunities.

As I also said&mdash;I repeat it now&mdash;I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to specific companies and purchases, I have before me a note to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Michael Lee, from Telecom, dated today, timed at 15.42 hours.

<PARA>It goes on to say why that is no longer the case. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recently Voxon approached Telstra with a proposal to jointly develop telecommunication products. Telstra Mobiles considered the possibility of a joint venture to develop a digital mobile phone.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk in more detail about that and what arrangements would be necessary. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra will consider purchasing the Voxon phone when development is complete, subject to the phone obtaining AUSTEL GSM Type Approval certification and passing our own internal test. All digital mobile phones that Telstra purchases are subjected to these tests and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra would welcome being able to purchase digital phones from a local supplier such as Voxon and wishes them well with their development.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a group of programs that can help to improve quality and the ability to win market share. We will slot those programs into this company. My department and the communications department are actively involved in assisting. My office is directly engaged. The market for this company, Telecom Australia, from the comments I have just read into the record, is disposed to purchasing Australian made goods for its operational network. I hope that is sufficient to encourage you to see that this is an action oriented agenda aimed at promoting the Australian flag on Australian made products for use in Australia and for export. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some final comments with regard to the Competition Policy Reform Bill. I believe that what has been done in this legislation is shameful and will not benefit the community, the general public, at all. I believe the objective of this bill is to cut up power, water and other utilities and force the states to sell them off according to a federal agenda to sell off large airports, increase costs for remote communities, and eventually close down or lead to a reduction of airports, post office agencies, train stations, medical services and schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the agenda is deregulation, where regulation is so-called anti-competitive. The Industry Commission called for all sorts of deregulation, all the way to cutting out requirements for minimum width for footpaths. You tell me what kind of competitive barrier regulations on footpath width represent. Yet the Industry Commission identifies this as an area for reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we will see a lot of this sort of thing, without consultation and with very little consideration and probably without much sense but a lot of dry right bureaucrats will be busy. Of more concern are the perennial targets. I am sure regulations on trading hours will be the first to go. We will encourage the United States style shopping with a few big chains opening 24 hours a day, employing juniors to keep costs down. You can bet such a push will be accompanied by pressure to eliminate any overtime regulations based on unsociable hours. You can bet it will put a lot of family businesses, corner delis and such out of business. Their major niche was the after-hours trade. So much for competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coles, Woolworths and maybe a franchise deli chain like 7-Eleven will survive. It could mean death to thousands of small businesses. Competition is about survival of the fittest: the biggest with the most economic muscle. The name `competition policy' is misleading. This is not about consumer choice but about privatisation and deregulation. Concerns about privatisation and the potential impact on consumers, the community and the environment are being overruled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privatisation will lead to private sector monopolies or oligopolies with consequent higher prices for many people and a reduction in the ability to pursue issues in the public interest. Yet we are told that the Trade Practices Act will allow anti-competitive private sector business behaviour to be taken to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not correspond with the general view of the current actions of the Trade Practices Act in relation to the private sector. For example, the oil companies have for some time been recognised as being an effective oligopoly that engages in price fixing and generally recognises the market share of other players. The pricing of CDs in Australia has also been noted as being significantly higher than in other countries for no apparent reason. Monopoly arrangements on book supplies have also attracted criticism for decades: in part because of the substantially higher prices that result and in part because of issues of simple availability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, government went so far as to join with other governments to re-establish the effective cartel of aluminium companies. This has been broken by the introduction of Russian aluminium. The government has established a minimum price for the protection of industries. These are industries assumed to take risks and, as a consequence, all profits from this intergovernmental action flow to the industries and their stockholders&mdash;not to the public and not to the governments concerned. The companies are not taking risks. Governments are helping them to form cartels to increase prices and guarantee them higher profits. There is no doubt that the move results in higher consumer prices on a global basis. It affects inputs in a range of industries and they will also end up raising their prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not competition that government seems to be interested in. It is the use of so-called competition policy to justify a range of social cutbacks in the name of economic efficiency. It has been used to drive dismemberment of public sector activities and a radical change in federal-state powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to call the attention of honourable senators to the proposed operation of section 51(1) which used to create exemptions from trade practices for activities specified by law or regulation. Any authorised legislation is still exempt, but to be authorised under section 51(1B)(a) a law must explicitly refer to the Competition Policy Reform Act. This effectively means that we start out with no legislation or regulation exempt. Any attempt to create exempt legislation must be approved by the commission and the minister. Government amendment No. 5 will further extend this to conduct under licenses. These are mentioned and are now subject to section 51(1B)(a) and they must refer to the Competition Policy Reform Act to be exempt, and are therefore not exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like it noted that in the whole process it appears that the minister has absolute veto. The state ministers can inform the commission, and the commission, with the council, holds an investigation and reaches a conclusion. This is passed on to the minister who considers the issue and decides. If she or he decides in contradiction to the commission, the commission accepts it. This is the chain of power. Read the act carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will create an organisation of considerable power; a vehicle to examine almost any aspect of government at almost any level&mdash;federal, state or local; a vehicle which can accept or reject decisions of parliament; a vehicle which will examine and approve or reject laws; a vehicle which will examine the private sector, the public sector and the service or community sectors; a vehicle which can effectively pass judgment on the department stores and businesses of this country; and a vehicle which can create offences by regulation and prosecute them through its own tribunal. It can examine prices and it can set prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asked to create this immensely powerful vehicle for executive action; action which makes parliaments subsidiary and sets itself above them in judgment. It is a far more radical arrangement of power than almost any suggestion on constitutional change in relation to the republic debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will set up this very powerful vehicle operating in relative autonomy but answerable to a minister. As Senator Boswell pointed out, it is a vehicle that will act by regulation. It is the ultimate vehicle that acts by regulation. It comes with its own think-tank, its own tribunal. It need not ever converse with parliamentarians. It will communicate by edict&mdash;by acceptance or rejection of the efforts of poor representative democracy. It is the wave of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State government has been told to write an agenda for reform and, as an afterthought, to include what they will do for safeguards. It can bring this back in a year. By this time, the ACCC should be up and can pass judgment on what the states have put forward. I hope that makes the situation clear. The states' agenda is conditional. The final agenda will be decided by the commission. It will then be approved by the federal minister. All those access agreements must pass the least restrictive to competition test. This is the sort of thing the World Trade Organisation applied in relation to various regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government makes decisions to protect and maximise its revenue. So we have it moving to a coordinated buying policy which will see virtually a third of computer goods bought from single sources. What is competitive about this? Nothing. Government does not pursue competition. It pursues short-term budget balancing and cost cutting. The point of privatisation is to generate short-term revenue. It is one-off revenue. At the same time, it eliminates income streams and the efficiency of potential integration of objectives and cooperation between departments. It will entail a massive regulatory effort to replace the natural oversight of a government agency. Either that, or there will not be regulation or consumer protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In competition, people cut corners. This might save costs, but there are prices to pay. They usually do not come due until those that have made the cuts have gone. It is possible to cut corners by doing things like putting in lower standard steel piping for water mains. The savings or profits are made immediately. The cost does not appear for over a decade, but by then the cost is considerable. Another form of efficiency is gained when a water provider does not need to be concerned about downstream issues or long-term management. All the record keeping, labour and expertise becomes unnecessary. Lots of money is saved when the activities stop, but no management generally means mismanagement with a cost later. Of course, that cost is considered a natural disaster and a social cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These types of approaches might provide short-term, narrow focus economic gains, but they are not efficient socially or from the perspective of overall economics or outcomes. Efficiency properly means doing more with less. The thing those keen on competition seem certain we need less of is labour. While there may be inefficiencies in some hypothetical instances, what often seems to have occurred in the last 10 years is that retrenchments have meant doing less with less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see moves for efficiency in hospitals. When an economist sees a worker in an emergency ward who is not busy stitching up someone, that economist sees inefficiency: obviously there are too many staff. The ideal situation from an economics standpoint is when the staff are always flat out. They are flat out on a calm night, they will have people waiting for urgent treatment on an average night and people waiting longer on a heavy night. They will be stressed and rushing like competing track stars. Is it efficient?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a medical administrator sees an emergency room without enough staff to cope with a normal heavy night in a timely way, she or he sees a different sort of inefficiency&mdash;one that might lead to death or permanent injury&mdash;rather than a large outlay figure. Efficiency in medical terms is having enough staff to deal with the injured in a timely way on most normal nights, whether they are heavy nights, average nights or calm nights. This means that if you have enough to cope on a heavy night, you might be less than flat out on an average night. You may be able to relax a bit on a calm night. The test of efficiency is in the functional outcome&mdash;whether people get the treatment they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People tend to see hospital services like the hospital administrator does. They see having to wait as inefficient. They call for efficiency and the economists step in and cut staff. Services are theoretically cheaper, although you might die waiting for them, or be in a lot of pain, and the cheaper treatment usually takes the form of less government outlay rather than actual savings for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this paranoid fantasy? Not long ago an administrator at Woden hospital complained of exactly this, stating that he was quitting and that staff levels could not cope with an average night. He outlined the consequences of a real emergency, a bus crash or similar accident. Yet this is what we are told is efficient medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it efficient to eliminate rural clinics and centralise resources in big hospitals? Is it efficient for all the people who have further&mdash;sometimes very much further&mdash;to go, often for quite basic treatment? Is it economically efficient? Does it lower your hospital bills? No. It probably increases the cost of transport and time lost. But the argument is that it lowers the government hospital bills and Medicare payments. Of course, the ultimate in efficiency is where government has no costs and people pay for all the services they use themselves. It is very efficient because it reduces demand. It reduces demand because many people cannot afford treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A less horrific example of doing less with less&mdash;one that makes a different but related point&mdash;is of public transport. If a route is not frequently used and the bus is not fully loaded, it is less efficient. The economists would argue that you should reduce the number of times the bus passes. Loading per trip will be greater, but the less frequently the bus comes by, the less efficient it is for the users and the more they will look for other options. If bus use continues to be poor, an alternative is to increase charges to recover costs. Those people living in Western Australia would probably recall that when the new train service was put on for the northern rail line there were twice as many trains to cope with the northern service. In fact, the payback time became much faster than was expected because more people wanted to use the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate result of economic efficiency measures designed to reduce expenditure is that a bus may run only once a day and a ticket costs twice or three times the cost of petrol for a private car. Only those who are entirely dependent on public transport are likely to use the bus at this stage. This happens far more often than it should and there are bus routes in Perth in exactly this state. Virtually everyone who can has given up and gone by car. At this point the transport company is liable to cut out the service altogether as unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a response to service costs is to cut services, at some point services are cut to such a degree that they become pointless. What exactly is the point of having security guards in Parliament House where senators can reach under a desk and push a distress button, then ask the same senators to walk around the building alone in the dark at midnight? Anyone wanting to attack a senator&mdash;gosh, who would?&mdash;would only have to wait outside in a car, jump out and drive away. So what is the point? When services are cut back far enough, there is little point in having them at all. It is reductio ad absurdum in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) would not oppose competition. It has its place, but it is not the supreme place, and certainly not the only place. This bill is a formula to hand over public functions to a handful of big players who are pursuing their own profit with little concern for the public. I see nothing in this bill that leads me to think that this bill provides provision for public welfare or well-being. When the agendas and safeguards and CSOs are in and spelled out, I might change my mind. But they are not, and we are passing this without them. The Greens (WA), therefore, completely oppose and condemn this bill. </PARA>

That means, imposing payroll tax, sales tax, rates and land tax on every school, hospital, church or social welfare organisation in Australia. The commission also cast an unfriendly eye on concessions to charities for water, sewerage and electricity charges. I understand that the commission's final report is either with or about to be delivered to the Treasurer (Mr Willis). Through the minister, I ask the government to release the report immediately it has been received, so that we can see how the Industry Commission proposes that user charges be levied on charities and the social infrastructure of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous amount of interest within the community on this whole question. If the report is not released swiftly, some people might well be entitled to conclude it as being probable that the removal of water, sewerage and electricity concessions for charities is on the agenda, and that part of a hidden agenda for raising revenue in this country is likely to embrace imposing full cost recovery user charges and indirect taxes on the non-profit community sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill and Senator Parer will address the detail of the bounty bill. Over the last three or four days there has been an enormous amount of work done to get the bill to this position. While being very critical of the bill the government put in its initial form, I do want to acknowledge the amount of work that the department officers have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation we have before us is incredibly important because it addresses a fundamental point of principle. It is one of the few areas in which both sides of this chamber are consistent, whereby a tax is rebated when it is applied to the cost of doing business in the industries of agriculture, mining, fishing and forestry. To the coalition, a fundamental policy in principle which is not shared by the government is that we would prefer to see all taxes on all business inputs progressively removed. By addressing this as a fundamental policy thrust, we believe that virtually every industry or business will be able to compete with any other country in the world. It will also have the dramatic impact of reducing unemployment and the evils that go with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is split into four fundamental areas. The first one is retrospectivity; the second is the abolition of the category of residential premises; the third is the narrowing of the definition of minerals; and the fourth is the tightening of the definitions of agriculture and mining operations. The original bill was just 9 1/2 pages. It was so badly put together in the stated policy position of the government on budget night&mdash;or was it? One must ask: was it a deliberate misrepresentation of the government's intention? There are seven pages of government amendments to a bill of 9 1/2 pages; and there are five from the opposition. I am not sure as yet how many there are from the Democrats and the Greens, but certainly there are a number of amendments from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue which I want to cover is retrospectivity. In doing so, it is interesting to note that, on 16 December 1993, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, in dealing with a bill at that particular time with regard to retrospectivity, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, once it is through, it is through. No-one will be able to do much with it because no-one is going to come back in here in nine months time and try retrospectively to legislate, in view of the workload of the Senate and in view of the fact that a lot of people in the Senate, including myself, are a little careful about retrospective legislation. I want to make that point to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA>In dealing with this bill we will see just how far this government has gone in terms of retrospectivity. We will be moving amendments to remove all aspects of retrospectivity, every single bit of it. We will also be moving to have the old act in place up until budget night and the new bill commencing from budget night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be noted that, from a public policy point of view&mdash;and Senator Schacht has said this many times&mdash;it is the government's intent to bring this scheme back to its original position. What is happening in practice is that the government has left itself wide open to all sorts of claims and applications, which we will see start to flood in once the legislation goes through, because the legislation fails to have the new laws operate from the night of announcement. I quote from the second reading speech to highlight the particular situation we have before us now and the changes that are being introduced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the last year in particular, as a result of a series of legal challenges, eligibility definitions in the Scheme have been subjected to considerable expansion. This has pointed to ambiguities in the interpretation of these definitions, which demand urgent remedial attention so as to prevent the exploitation of the Scheme and a consequential drain on the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason there are these claims is that the customs department itself was interpreting the act wrongly. It was not until such time as these cases were taken before the courts in this land, initially the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that we found there was a wrong interpretation of the position of the customs department. That is worth bearing in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot condone, nor can we support, a unilateral action which dissolves people's rights in law by the stroke of a pen in this parliament. In this particular case, to be going back to 1986 is beyond belief. The government, which has been in power all this time, has had plenty of time to fix up its own mess. It is now complaining about what it terms `mickey mouse claims' because of a problem that it created and a problem that it allowed to perpetuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments also create an enormous challenge to the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine. Are they going to stand up and be counted with regard to protecting people's rights in law or are they going to collapse and go with the government? They will be judged either very kindly if they stand up for the fundamental principles or very harshly if they do not. We will find out in due course what their position will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the government has chosen this route, because it has always been about interfering with the rights of the individual; whereas we believe that the right of the individual is paramount. I would also add that I have not heard the government in this place claiming that there were fundamental flaws in the diesel fuel rebate and that the scheme needed changing to this extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second category I raised is the matter of residential premises. Our position is quite simple and clear on that: it is purely a matter of equity. We will be moving amendments so that people who do not have access to alternative sources of power will be eligible for the diesel fuel rebate for their residential premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The third matter of principle is the narrowing of the definition of minerals. We once again will be opposing this measure because, in essence, we do not differentiate between the digging and processing of iron ore, for example, and the digging and processing of clay to make house bricks and tiles. It is fairly difficult to draw a distinction between those processes and the follow-up process in a manufacturing operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there is the narrowing of the definition of mining and agriculture. I have referred to the enormous number of amendments before the chamber for this legislation. Despite assurances given by the government, I believe that the intent of the bill was to greatly reduce the areas that were claimable under the previous scheme in law, practice and custom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If in fact the government intent with agriculture, for example, was to remove amenity agriculture, that would involve a very simple amendment which clearly stated that only bone fide commercial agricultural or pastoral activities qualified. I think this is a classic example where KISS&mdash;that is, keep it simple, stupid&mdash;principles should have been applied. We now have an unbelievable list of activities, for both mining and agriculture, from the government, ourselves, the Greens and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has opened up a hornets' nest, I believe, which will live in the courts. We will be dealing in detail with various amendments in the committee stage, so at this time I will deal with only one: the amendment we are putting forward with regard to soil conservation work carried out in designated catchment areas through an approved catchment plan. I am absolutely amazed that the government has not picked up this particular amendment we put forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The diesel fuel rebate scheme is, I believe, one of the worst examples of public policy making legislation and implementation on the Commonwealth parliamentary record. Thirteen years ago a coalition government changed from a system in which all off-road users of diesel were exempt from excise to a system where an arbitrary selection of off-road users of diesel were entitled to a rebate, and so the diesel fuel rebate scheme was born.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of the day failed to define any policy objectives for the scheme. They were imprecise in the  statement of policy intent; the wording of the act was vague, allowing a range of interpretations as to where the boundaries of the scheme lay; and the then government certainly did not provide a convincing justification as to why it had chosen to smile upon some groups, such as farmers and miners, while excluding from the scheme other major contributors to the Australian economy, such as our railways, our manufacturers, our marine tourist operators and many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, Australian Democrat Senator John Siddons asked the simple question: who will be worse off in the new scheme? The government failed to answer. Failing to provide a simple, clear answer as to who was and was not supposed to be covered by the scheme condemned the Commonwealth government of the day to 13 years of incessant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is riddled with anomalies. If you mine ore, transport it to the processing site and then process it and sell it you can claim a rebate for the transportation. If you mine ore, process it and then transport it and sell it you cannot claim for the transportation. Where is the sense in that? Consider two identical boats off the coast of Queensland, one fishing, the other one carrying tourists, both earning valuable export dollars for Australia. The fishing boat gets the rebate, the identical tour boat does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original excise was meant to make diesel-using vehicles contribute towards road costs, but the exclusion of rail from the scheme pushes more traffic back on to the roads, adding to those very same costs. The scheme is supposed to help farmers and miners, but pushing up rail costs means it slugs those same farmers and miners every time they send their goods to market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three different rates of rebate for different sorts of activities. Do they bear any relation to any stated policy objectives? Mining uranium for export to France gets a 92 per cent rebate. Powering hospitals and aged care facilities gets a 76 per cent rebate. I wonder if the minister can confirm that this is an accurate reflection of this government's priorities. </PARA>

That will be an amendment that the Democrats will move, and I trust you will support it. For 13 years these anomalies have been brought to government attention again and again. For 13 years claims for rebate have been the subject of dispute, appeal and counter appeal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office told the government to define some objectives for the scheme. What was the outcome? Nothing. The Industry Commission told the government that the scheme was discriminatory and needed fixing. What was the outcome? Nothing. John Button, former minister for industry, was going to undertake a review of the scheme and all its anomalies. What happened? Nothing. Finally, in 1995, this government is taking action. But does it take action to fix this botched up mess of a scheme? No. The only reason it takes action is that it is desperate for revenue in order to maintain its fiction of a budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has approached the diesel fuel rebate scheme as some sort of a vast, misshapen piggy bank to be smashed open and raided for whatever pennies could be scraped out. Only because it needs money and only because 13 years of failure to fix this mess have finally caught up with the government through a series of unexpected court room losses has the government chosen to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in taking this action to smash open the diesel fuel rebate piggy bank the government has taken little or no care. It has not consulted adequately with affected groups and it has given no consideration to simple fairness. In attempting to abolish the residential category, a change for which there is not even an attempt at justification in the minister's second reading speech, the government did not consider the huge slug on pensioners, who cannot afford to convert their old diesel heaters. The Australian Democrats call on the government to introduce a scheme to assist people to convert to more efficient forms of domestic heating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also failed to consider the impacts on people living in remote areas, not to mention the sudden cost increase being imposed on remote area tourist operators, remote area roadhouses or coastal shipping. I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to ensure that those living and working in remote areas of Australia who are currently entitled to the rebate are protected from unfair and unavoidable rises in the cost of energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of this measure would be minor but let me state further that the Australian Democrats would support any attempt by the government to recoup the cost through a very minor adjustment to rebate rates. In other words, we do not mind if we get an adjustment of fairness in the way in which the scheme impacts by aiding people living and working in remote areas and decreasing the rebate to pay for that of those people, miners in particular, who currently are on a good wicket. We are, I repeat, a fiscally responsible party. I wonder whether the government will be prepared to accept that particular challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an associated budget measure, the government announced a mammoth 380 per cent increase in the rate of excise on light fuel. While there is some sense behind this decision in terms of stopping substitution of diesel for a less efficient fuel&mdash;and that is generally acknowledged&mdash;the government has once again failed to consult and failed to consider the impacts of such a massive immediate tax rise. The impact on rail costs will be a hidden slug for the very miners and farmers that the diesel rebate scheme is supposedly designed to help&mdash;not to mention the fact that rail transport is by far the most environmentally benign and efficient that this country can offer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all been very critical of our government's attitude towards the French in the last couple of weeks. We have been saying that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) should have taken a much harder stance towards the French. In fact, that has toughened the backbone of our foreign minister, and we now have a stronger position yet the Australian taxpayers continue to subsidise the mining of uranium and its sale to the French. I really commend that amendment to the attention of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other issues I would like to deal with. The first is the claim in some quarters that exclusion of clay for bricks and limestone for cement from the rebate scheme, the only two quarried home building materials that currently get the rebate, will add huge amounts to the cost of a new home. That is garbage. I worked in the building industry for a number of years. I have compared my own calculations with those of the housing industry. We both agree that the maximum impact on the cost of building a new home would be less than $50&mdash;hardly a sum to be taken into account. To pursue the argument that the digging up of clay and limestone in this context is equal to the extraction of minerals in the definition of mining is just ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with the great furphy of the so-called retrospectivity of this bill. With regard to this so-called retrospectivity, a view has been put to the Australian Democrats by the Minerals Council, formerly AMIC. I should point out that this body is a representative industry body whose members include Boral, CSR and Pioneer, the three major groups which feel they are being hurt by so-called retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view put to us by the Minerals Council is that this bill is not about retrospectivity but about the clarification of the intent of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. This is not like a retrospective tax; this is not like going back to 1986 and saying, `Oh, we forgot to charge some tax, pay it up now.' This is about taxpayers' money which was never intended to be handed out for the activities for which it is now being claimed. It was never intended to be a rebate for lawn mowing. It was never intended to finance drilling for water or supplying electricity to a grid. It was never intended to count dredging sand or exploding stones out of a quarry as mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the cases that we are dealing with. In the so-called Nunawading case, Customs won in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the claim which the Nunawading Council made that lawn mowing was agriculture. Who in their right mind would class lawn mowing of nature strips, parks and gardens of a local council as agriculture? Nunawading appealed to the Federal Court. That is where the case now stands&mdash;hardly a settled law of the day. But if Nunawading's claim at some future date and against all available evidence should be successful, the Australian taxpayer would be up for $40 million on what can only be described as a furphy&mdash;a stupid claim that lawn mowing is part of agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to mining for minerals, the extraction of minerals, the quarrying and dredging of sand. In this bill the government excludes the mining of sand, sandstone, soil, slate, clay, basalt, granite, limestone and water. That, I believe, is a fair enough start. In the Neumann Sands case, the claim was made that the dredging of sand for concrete and as bedding sand should be classed as mining. In the 1987 Neumann case that claim was rejected&mdash;and, I believe, rightly so. In the 1995 Neumann Sands case the arguments that were used by the court to justify that judgment were apparently overturned. That case is now on appeal to the Federal Court. If the government lost the case, the Australian taxpayer would be up for $91 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a related case which uses some of the arguments we used in the Neumann's case&mdash;that is, the water authority of WA. It was claimed that the pumping of water was rebatable under the mining heading. There is another case, under the sweeper clauses, on agriculture and mining&mdash;that is, the Cowell Electric supply case. It was held that, if some of the electricity supply to towns was used for agriculture, it could properly be applied under the category of agriculture to qualify for the rebate. Here the Australian taxpayer would be up for $30 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have a settled area of law here that is being changed retrospectively; we have a series of decisions which are palpably not intended by the definitions of the original legislation. Admittedly that legislation was ill defined. Admittedly it should have been changed by previous governments and by this government, but it has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why on earth would we now fall for the trick of somebody calling for clarification on commonsense and legal grounds? Why would we call clarification retrospectivity? Why would we fall for that trick because somebody was clever to use the word `retrospectivity'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position of the Greens (WA) in relation to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill can be put fairly succinctly. We have problems with cutting out specifically the electric generation portion of the residential rebate without seeing a clear package of compensation. There are a number of issues, but they have not been examined or resolved. We would support a review and modification of that rebate, with the exclusion of heating, cooking and other items, but that is not an option now. We certainly do not have the time to try to do this unilaterally or to propose extensive amendments. We have some amendments that we will move, but if they should fail we will vote to retain the current residential rebate scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the attempt to exclude so-called amenity agriculture. We support the exclusion of water from the definition of `mineral' for the purpose of the mining rebate and we will agree to them being excluded retrospectively. We will also look carefully at the sweeper clauses. We think the court was right about the Cowell case, but agree that the definition of `associated with agriculture or mining' is too open and should be more restrictive. How to make it restrictive without cutting out a range of important things is a difficult issue, and one we have all wrestled with. The plethora of the amendments&mdash;pages of them&mdash;is testimony of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to quarrying generally, we would agree to exclude them in the future but not retrospectively. We think that water and amenity agriculture can be seen as a fairly clear cut issue in terms of the act. They should not be, and never have been, considered as mining or agriculture. The amount of agonising about quarrying is good evidence that there is no such clarity about this issue. In such a case, parliament should not abuse its power by overriding the judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has always been our basic position. It has not changed or shifted, as a member of Senator Schacht's staff claimed. The only thing that has shifted and changed has been the government's position. It has changed in relation to its labyrinthine attempts to cobble together some sort of deal to give it what it wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not think the elimination of residential rebates, which are basically for rural people, should occur without a clear understanding of who will be affected and how the effects can be reduced. The government has tried to make a few concessions by including residential power generation within the definition of mining and agriculture. It has been announced that there will be a compensation package for Aboriginal communities, but there are other users who would be affected. This measure will effect people from remote communities and rural users. We should also include the in port aspect of coastal shipping where diesel is used to generate residential power for the residential requirements of the crew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, there are a number of anomalies and inequities and there is no clear plan to remedy them. When there is, we may support this measure, but until then we will support the elimination of the residential rebate. Our preference is for a modified residential rebate that exclusively covers electricity generation. This could address several of our concerns. Some cost increases could be ameliorated by transferring the rebate for residential power generation under the mining rebate, which is about 30c a litre, or the agricultural rebate, which is about 32c per litre, to the residential rebate, which is paid at 24c. Governments will save between 6c and 8c per litre on all residential use by mining and agriculture, which is by far the bulk of residential diesel electricity use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will state on the record that the Greens (WA) do not favour diesel power generation. We believe that there are viable, often less expensive alternatives. The problem is the capital cost. If the government can come up with a program to support conversion through providing loan funds, tax rebates or through other means or a combination of means, we would happily support a move to decrease or eliminate the residential rebate. The program run by Illawarra Power is, in our opinion, a good start and possibly a good model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with diesel fuel rebates and retrospectivity. The issue is generally not about the classification or rebate but about the nature of the retrospectivity to 1986. There certainly are cases where legislation has included extension backwards in time. There was the case of the Chinese rifle imports or the Volvo claim. These certainly arise where a loophole in legislation that escaped parliamentary notice is discovered or a court makes a ruling on law which may be contrary to everyone's perception of what the intention of the law is. This can occur, and courts can and do rule on points of law, even if the court recognises that the ruling contradicts the sense of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example is the recent finding of the court in relation to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Such a ruling casts all actions under such a law into question. The only option parliament has to preserve the intention of the law and the former actions under the law is to legislate to correct the problem and apply that legislation backwards. Such cases are rare. When they occur, there is generally a clear perception that this is an exceptionable case and so falls outside the normal definition of retrospectivity. The Senate has and does act in such cases. The question here is whether the matters brought before us in this legislation fit into this category. I will go through our interpretations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with amenity agriculture. If the law and other documents, the position of the customs office and rulings of the court consistently found that an area was excluded from rebate&mdash;there has not been any finding to the contrary&mdash;a backdated claim is not retrospective; it is clarification. The fact that a matter may still be before the court is not grounds against such clarification. Such a progression of claims may mean that the issue is always before the court. The fact that an issue is consistently raised is prima facie grounds to consider that the area in question is not clear and requires reclarification. In relation to amenity agriculture, this principle applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with the notion of water as a mineral. If the law and other documents, the position of the customs office and the rulings of the court consistently found that an area was excluded from rebate or the area was not raised previously and now only an unexpected and unprecedented judgment was handed down in the court, there is a strong argument that the court is making a ruling on law. The Volvo case is such an example. To close a loophole opened by such an unexpected and inconsistent court ruling is not retrospective in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The finding that water is a mineral under the meaning of the mining rebate is, in our opinion, such an instance. I  doubt if anyone in the Senate could honestly state that they think the intent of the mining rebate is to give a rebate to water extraction. In one famous case, Coca-Cola claimed that Coca-Cola was nutritious because it included water, and water is a nutrient. Water comes under many different headings. In this sense, obviously, that is not what we mean when we are talking about nutritious, and it is certainly not what a lot of people would mean when they mean mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not believe that any average person would easily accept that water extraction is mining or that water is a mining product. I cannot seriously believe that the court would believe for a moment that it was the intention of the Customs Act to include water as a mineral for the purpose of the act. The Greens (WA) therefore believe that the finding was in relation to an unclarity in the act and that by accident it allowed water to fall under the definition of mining. In such a case I believe that it is proper to clarify the situation backwards as well as forwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quarrying is a different matter. Customs initially granted rebates to quarrying under the law. This is evidence that the law itself appears to include quarrying, and Customs itself held this to be the case. The change in policy by customs was pursued through a loophole interpretation in which Customs believed it could claim it was not required to give rebates for quarrying. In spite of a level of unclarity that led Customs to give rebates for quarrying, Customs did not seek to clarify the issue through legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the definition of mining was re-extended to cover quarrying operations. The courts found that the quarrying of limestone, granite and other materials for dressed building blocks was mining. Still Customs did not act. When Customs continued to insist that other forms of quarrying were not included, it could hardly claim that further extensions of the definition of mining to cover quarrying were unexpected. A key finding of the Auditor-General's report No. 27 of 1990-91 into the diesel rebate scheme was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria for eligibility under the scheme are complex and ill-defined. This combination has had the effect of broadening the scope of the scheme, increasing the likelihood of incorrect rebate payments being made and adding to the costs of administering the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>This seems a fairly clear warning that a better definition is needed, and quarrying is certainly one of the most dubious areas of definition. In its lobbying to us, Customs gave us a document that on page 3 provides a definition of mining as `obtaining a mineral or minerals embedded in the material that was to be extracted'. This would be great from our perspective because we think it could be used to knock out rebates on coalmining. I note that this is not the definition that the government has proposed. Instead it seeks to exclude the products of quarrying. That is at least clearer. I give this definition only to illustrate the lack of clarity even with what the government was arguing in discussions with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the Greens (WA) would love to exclude quarrying. We are not anxious to include any more benefits to mining. We think the benefits are too great already, and we have consistently argued for a reduction of the mining rebate, which is rapidly expanding towards a cost of $1 billion each year. We certainly do not want to give any free kicks to the mining industry. We are happy to legislate to explicitly exclude quarrying, including those areas where claims are of longer standing such as limestone and granite, in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue for us is that to legislate backwards in this case cannot be interpreted as anything other than overruling the decision of the courts in our minds. If the Greens, who would love to knock out the mining rebate, cannot accept the government arguments that it is not retrospective, I cannot see how anyone else can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area is anything but clear. Customs has not been clear. Certainly the situation and the right of the many conflicting claims have not been clear to many of us in the Senate. The current definition is incredibly contentious. Problems have been evident for many years. Customs has failed to clarify them. What we are now being asked to do is to overrule the court, which cannot be seen as finding on a point of law; to go against the court which has found that the intention of the law does include quarrying, and to legislate retrospectively. This seems to us a violation of the legal system by the legislature and an abuse of the principle that we will not legislate retrospectively. It has none of the qualities of our decision on water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot ethically support what we can only see as a ham-fisted attempt to remedy Customs inaction. The fact that we do not want quarrying to claim is not a good enough argument for the Senate to overrule the courts. The fact that the government might lose money is also not a good enough  argument for the Senate to overrule the courts. The Greens cannot vote for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the sweeper clauses, where Customs has sought to exclude certain activities and the courts have found against it, parliament may agree with the courts. The judgment may be entirely logical and consistent with the law. It appears that positive finding for claims on use of diesel for power generation based on the portion that goes to farmers is such a case. It is entirely consistent with the granting of a rebate to stand-alone power in the same situation. To override the court would be to create a disincentive to grid connected diesel power for the same user in the same circumstance. It may not create that disincentive under the current situation of power provided at a flat rate to all users, but it may make a difference to rural communities when the competition policy bites and rural users and rural power stations face a situation of cost recovery instead of cross-subsidy. It is worth noting that small rural power stations are almost the only users of diesel power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If rural power stations could claim a rebate for the portion of power provided to users who would be eligible for rebate for stand-alone diesel power, then the cost attributable to rural users would be less. In a cost recovery situation, rural users would pay lower power bills. We think this is a good idea, although we would prefer a program to convert rural power to sustainable sources. It is possible that, if the government were liable for such a rebate, it may consider such conversion more urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be putting up an amendment to support the decision in the Cowell case and to extend the residential rebate to the generation of electricity with diesel other than at a premises as long as there is no other form of commercial energy available. The only other way we can protect that decision is to knock out the definition of agriculture, which leaves claims under the sweeper clauses and amenity agriculture open.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Otherwise, we basically support the definitions of agriculture and mining that the government has put up, with some amendments made by various parties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Spindler of the Australian Democrats and Senator Schacht, by interjection, say that the previous government left no direction on the diesel fuel rebate scheme, which was introduced in 1982. I beg to differ. I would like to read from the second reading speech delivered by the then Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Michael Hodgman, on 17 August 1982 on the Diesel Fuel Tax Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1982. He said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the Government imposing extra costs on drought stricken primary producers by changing the diesel fuel excise exemption to a rebate? Does the Government know that fuel costs represent a high proportion of farm cash costs, for example,  13 per cent for wheat growers? Will farmers have to fill in a form to get the rebate? How long will rebate applications take to process? Will the rebate not be repaid until taxation returns are processed at the end of the year? Who was making $176m out of the previous farm exemption system?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard simply replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes that I announced on Tuesday night do not represent by any stretch of the imagination discrimination against primary producers.</PARA>

<PARA>He claimed that having a rebate would disadvantage some industries. However, soon after all of that had been put into place the coalition went out of government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened since then? The rebate has not blown out of proportion as much as we were told last week at the legislation committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since March 1983, when this government came to power, if the government had any problems&mdash;Senator Button tried to do this&mdash;it should have been sorting them out gradually as time went on. Unfortunately, the government did not do anything about the problems and tried to fix them up a bit here and a bit there. For instance, the government took 4c off the mining industry in the budget of two years ago. It went to the AAT with this and that; it might have won this and lost that&mdash;that sort of thing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other areas that I would like to address. Senator Spindler mentioned the effect on diesel fuel in relation to the quarrying of clay for the making of bricks. To me, quarrying is quarrying.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I abhor retrospective legislation and I do not think it is the way that Australia should be going. I have no sympathy for golf clubs claiming the diesel fuel rebate for mowing golf courses. The water authority in Western Australia has put in a claim for pumping water. I have no sympathy for that authority. The authority would have charged its rates from 1986 onwards and the ratepayers would have paid. If the authority won a big claim it might pass it on to ratepayers. However, retrospective legislation is retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens call it clarification or something, but it is still retrospective legislation. If the government has such a good case it should let the matter go to the highest court in the land and have it sorted out.

The government has not touched the matter legislatively since 1982 and that is why it now has this problem. </PARA>

I believed that there was a regulation that the rebate had to be claimed within 12 months. I was always under that impression. In our business we made sure that we claimed at least every three or four months. If the government had introduced this legislation two or three years ago we would not have had a problem with retrospectivity back to 1986. I have had it in the back of my mind so the government must have at least spoken about it at some stage. </PARA>

You can get some pretty good light crude oil now. It can be used on high performing diesels and in road vehicles without changing filters or fuel pumps or adjusting injectors. However, I have no sympathy for transporters who are getting away with not paying the levy because they should compete on the same level as everyone else. Once the levy is in place those people will go back to using diesel. I believe it is wrong to change the treatment for off-road vehicles. Light crude oil is used off road and I do not believe that it should be levied on power generation. </PARA>

It features an old 44-gallon drum, which is now called a 200-litre drum. This chart shows the possible yield from a barrel of crude oil. Roughly 50 per cent comes off as gasoline. Prior to 1957 it had a levy on it for road usage. Forty-four per cent is distillate, or diesel fuel in everyman's language. That has had a levy on it since 1957, but it changed in 1982 to the rebate scheme. Then there is a narrow band of crude oil, or light cycle oil. </PARA>

It has turned it into a broad based taxation system. It might as well have looked at a broad based consumption tax, which Mr Keating suggested in 1983.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate today is debating the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill. The bill will amend various provisions of the Customs Act and will modify the eligibility criteria for diesel fuel rebate scheme recipients, as foreshadowed in this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present form of the diesel fuel rebate scheme dates from 1 August 1986 and provides eligible primary producers undertaking off-road activities with a 100 per cent rebate on diesel fuel excise, which currently stands at 32.5c a litre. The government is always telling us that we would have put sales tax on everything. I think we ought to put it on the record that the excise would have been 15c a litre instead of 32c. The mining companies will receive a rebate of 31c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other eligible users, including hospitals, aged homes, nursing homes and residential will receive a rebate of 24.8c per litre. In 1994-95 the diesel fuel rebate granted to primary producers will be $515 million, rising to $543 million in 1995-96. The rebate to the mining industry for 1994-95 will be $632 million and $691 million in 1995-96. To put these figures in context, the government anticipates raising $3.9 billion from diesel excise in 1995-96, up from $3.6 billion in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four main sections of the customs and excise bill. They include, firstly, the exclusion of the agriculture category for rebate eligibility from 1 August 1996, with estimated savings of $15 million in 1995-96 and retrospective savings of around $40 million. Secondly, the bill will abolish the residential premises category from the rebate eligibility from July 1995, with estimated savings of $13.6 million in 1995-96, offset by $1.8 million in compensation. Thirdly, the bill will narrow the definition of minerals to exclude from rebate eligibility mining operations that involve the extraction of sand, sandstone, clay, granite and water from 1 August 1996. We are really going to the bottom of the barrel to make that differentiation between mining and extraction. But I suppose that desperate needs demand desperate measures, and the government wanted to get that budget into surplus. </PARA>

Fourthly, the bill will tighten the definition of agricultural and mining operations by removing the broad sweeper clause and replacing it with the prescribed list of activities that entitle rebate eligibility. The estimated savings will be $7 million in 1994-95, with retrospective savings of at least $30 million. That is despite government assertions that the purpose of these amendments was to restore the scope of the diesel fuel rebate scheme to that introduced in 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable concern was raised by various industry groups that the proposed changes in the bill went much further than those announced in the budget. That is correct. We did not get a lot of flak when the budget came out, but when people did investigate it, a huge amount of concern was raised. As a result of that concern, the bill was referred to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for review. Nineteen submissions were received from industry groups, farming and mining organisations, including the NFF, WA Farmers, AMEC, MIM and the Tourism Task Force, amongst others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will touch briefly on some of the main concerns raised about this deeply flawed bill. The retrospective element of the bill, reaching back nine years to 1986, have been roundly condemned. As stated in the Senate committee report, the retrospective elements of the bill fail to overturn all decisions handed down by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court to the financial disadvantage of the claimants and abort other decisions in the process. The government's rationale for introducing these retrospective measures is that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Federal Court judgments have resulted in broadening the scope of eligible rebate activities beyond the original intention of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This did nothing to allay the concerns of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. That committee found that the bill clearly trespasses on the basic rights of those who are subject to the law, who are entitled to be treated according to what the law means and, at the same time, as declared by the courts. The Law Council of Australia submitted that the amendments offend against proper principles in a number of areas, including constitutional concerns that the right to obtain a rebate&mdash;which has existed since at least 1986&mdash;is to be removed, without allowing any just terms as required by section 51, and the proposal to introduce retrospectivity without compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, rightly, is opposing the retrospective elements contained in this bill. The amendment dealing with the tightening of the definition of `agricultural and mining operations' raised a great deal of disquiet at the Senate committee. The NFF stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the prescribed lists inevitably lacked detail, suffered definitional problems, overlooked needs of circumstances in small industries and failed to keep pace with the changing industry practice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>AMEC submitted that the new definitions in the bill are vague and incomplete, and that the operation of the scheme would depend upon subjective decisions by the Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane has led this debate for the coalition and he has done an excellent job in running these amendments to ground. He and I deplore the fact that the government remains adamant, even after the Senate committee hearing, that primary producers carting grain and stock from storage areas to the front gate, as well as subcontractors carting off road, will not be eligible in this tightening category. To categorically exclude such activities as extraction of sand, sandstone, soil, clay and water, where the materials are not being recovered with their inherent mineral qualities, would have the effect, as stated by the shadow resource minister, Peter McGauran&mdash;</PARA>

Boral, Pioneer and CRS, which comprise 75 per cent of the quarrying industry, have submitted that this measure will cost them heavily and would result in increases to the costs of building material. And yet that would have been another increase in the cost of a home to be borne by newly married couples if the coalition were not forever vigilant and watched for these increases in tax. Of course, we will be voting against it. We will oppose those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to abolish the `residential' category from the rebate eligibility has serious implications for residents in remote areas. It is a callous action by the government.

But it should not persecute the people; they are Australians too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister stated, the customs figures show that there were 14,500 claims received under the residential category in 1992-93 of which 13,500 were individuals, the remainder being hospitals, nursing homes, medical institutions and aged care homes. If Australians living in rural and remote areas are forced to use diesel fuel as a result of lacking access to an electricity grid or any other energy source, then they fully deserve to continue to receive a rebate&mdash;and the coalition will be moving such an amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the government has supplied amendments nos 1 to 28 in relation to some aspects of clarification and some specific activities which relate to this. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest No. 7</EMPHASIS> of this year, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee noted that subclause 2(2) items 4, 7, 8 and 10 of schedule 1 will have effect retrospectively from 1986. These items propose amendments to the definition of agriculture, minerals and mining operations in subsection 164(7) of the Customs Act 1901. They set out some of the uses of diesel fuel which will attract rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, it was intended that only miners and farmers would have the benefit of such rebate. I note the comments made by Senator Spindler earlier in this regard, that there was a question of intention. Parliament may well have intended that certain aspects flow from the legislation which it enacted some time ago&mdash;but did the people of Australia understand that? There is nothing unusual in legislation having a progressive interpretation by the courts over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that, in this instance, courts and tribunals had a varying interpretation over time in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Government would not be responsible if it did not respond to the various interpretations placed on legislation, especially if there was some sort of loophole. But what responsible government does is act when that loophole comes to light&mdash;and it acts prospectively, not retrospectively. There may well be a loophole which needs attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention was made earlier that rebates are available in relation to mowing golf courses, lawns and the like. I think the case involving Nunawading City Council was mentioned. But, in this instance, I believe the government has been on notice for some time that there have been problems in relation to this area, and it should have acted earlier. I think earlier speakers&mdash;including Senator Crane, Senator Margetts and Senator Spindler&mdash;touched on this very point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should have acted at that time and should have legislated prospectively. It was with the aspect of retrospectivity in mind that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills drew to the attention of the Senate the fact that these provisions unduly trespass upon the basic rights of individuals. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those subject to the law are entitled to be treated according to what the law says at the relevant time and according to what the law means at that time as declared by the courts.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a basic principle of law, a basic tenet of our legal system. In this instance, it is not a question of clarification; it is a question of retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some instances, the legislature accommodates retrospective legislation. We sometimes have legislation by press release. That is, the minister makes a press release and subsequently there is legislation. People are placed on notice that legislation is being brought in which will have some effect, if not total effect, from the date of the press release and, normally, the time lapse between the press release and the passing of the legislation is not too great. But one also has to look at any question of prejudice that might be suffered by individuals and, of course, the extent of the retrospectivity. In this case, we have a period of time which goes back to 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the question of prejudice has some application to those who have court cases pending. I notice that there is some mention in the bill of applications or proceedings which are pending in the Federal Court. I note that, in the Cowell Electric Supply Co. case, special leave is being sought to appeal to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are any pending proceedings, you have the situation where the ground rules are changed in the course of those proceedings, and that is prejudicial to the person who is bringing that action. That happened in some refugee cases in relation to another piece of legislation dealing with migration, and that too was abhorrent for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that I say that the provisions here do offend the principle of retrospectivity. For that reason, I believe the coalition should oppose these provisions, and is doing so. To treat them merely as clarification is not quite appropriate here because the government is enacting legislation which will go back some time and will have wide effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the legislation were prospective, then it could be clarification. But I do not believe you can clarify the law in the past. I believe that clarification can only act prospectively. You cannot clarify what people thought yesterday, because what they thought yesterday has been and gone. You can only clarify what people will think in the future, how people will approach a matter and how they will understand it. With great respect to Senator Spindler, I cannot accept his argument as to clarification in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I might just point to the question of the definitions of `minerals' and `agriculture' and contrast that with the amendments which have been lately brought before the Senate. There are a number of clarifications for which I applaud the government, but I believe this demonstrates how the government has approached this matter in a somewhat ad hoc fashion. I do not wish to criticise the government for perhaps being alive to some issues and thereby remedying it. But I believe that the number of amendments, and the way they have been brought before the Senate, indicates that perhaps there could have been some forethought on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that, for instance, there is a clearer definition of `earthworks' and a clearer accommodation of the planting of trees on agricultural property. It is available for rebate as long as the planting of trees is not for the purpose of felling. I think that is laudable, but the government has to be very careful that, in including so many specifics in the legislation, it still does not leave unaddressed other aspects, other activities, which could well attract a legitimate rebate. </PARA>

That, I believe, rests squarely at the door of the government. Nonetheless, for the base reason of retrospectivity, I believe these provisions have to be opposed. The prospective ones rest in somewhat of a different category. As I say, I am pleased to see there has been some clarification in that regard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, these are significant and major changes to the operational processes of Customs&mdash;the most significant since federation, when Customs was one of the first departments established. From now on, inside the border of Australia, Customs will not be able to seize goods for any reason unless it has a judicial warrant. Until now, even in a commercial dispute Customs could seize commercial goods without a warrant. I think this led to a culture within Customs that was out of kilter with the provisions of what we would accept as community standards in this area of legal process in the latter part of the 20th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes are a major achievement for the reform process within Customs. I pay tribute to the officers of Customs who have helped me draft these amendments, which are significant and major. I also pay tribute, now 15 to 16 months on from the announcement of the Conroy review recommendations, to Customs for performing magnificently in the restructuring of its department. It has made structural and operational changes. As Senator Parer said quite rightly, those changes have been significant. I appreciate his support. I also place on record my appreciation to all the staff at Customs for their work in this area. These are major changes for the better. They will make the service a better service for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the real debate on these bills, which is the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Senator Spindler and some other senators have in one form or another criticised the government for not making changes to this scheme earlier than 1995. They said this government has now been in office for some 13 years. We inherited the scheme from the Fraser government in August 1982. Most of the problems we are dealing with in this scheme have come to light over the last three, four or maybe five years. An attempt was made in the 1993 budget to deal with some of these issues. That was my first attempt. I was not very successful, in view of opposition in the Senate. In this budget we have attempted to deal with the problems of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my second reading speech and in debates here on urgency motions I have pointed out to the Senate that this scheme was introduced to help the mining, farming, forestry and fisheries industries in the off-road use of diesel. That was always the policy intent of the Fraser government and it was the policy intent of this government. We intend that this scheme, if it is to survive, should maintain that focus. Every attempt to expand and extend the definition ultimately means that the whole scheme itself will come into question when you see a scheme that cost $150 million or thereabouts in 1982 now costing $1,200 million. At the present growth rate, even with these restrictions and the new clarifications, it is still going to grow significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler made some very damning remarks and descriptions about the whole scheme, basically implying that it should be abolished and that we should start again or do something else. Many sectors in our community would be up in arms at such a suggestion. Those sectors that have an advantage from the scheme ought to be very supportive of what we are doing here tonight to make sure that the scheme maintains its substance and its direction. I have only been in the portfolio two and a half years and since I have been there I have made genuine attempts to address these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler is right to point out the Auditor-General's previous comments about the running of this scheme. It is impossible to guarantee the policy intent of the scheme, that the money being spent is actually being spent as we want it for the scheme, because it is overwhelmingly self-assessment. There are 250,000 applications for diesel fuel rebate every year. We have 140 officers in Customs administering the scheme, and they do a mighty job with the resources they have. They cannot guarantee that every litre of diesel that is claimed for rebate is actually eligible. So we always get criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has announced another review of the scheme by the end of this year, and I will bet two bob to Sydney Harbour Bridge that he will criticise aspects of the administration of the scheme&mdash;although not the individual officers, because it is impossible for them to carry out and guarantee absolutely the intent of the scheme, even with the clarifications we are now making for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the mining and agricultural industries of Australia: if you want this scheme to continue for a long time into the future you ought to support this government's changes made here tonight because they ensure the integrity of the scheme as far as that is humanly possible. That is an important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the sweeper clauses, to give them their nickname&mdash;the new clarifications and definitions. They were put into this bill so that there would be less opportunity for people to win some arcane argument in an AAT court or anywhere else to extend the nature of the scheme, and instead of having broad definitions open to argument and interpretation, and clever lawyers and QCs arguing where it could be extended. We have the ridiculous example of only a few weeks ago that pumping water out of the ground is the equivalent of mining. Under any commonsense definition that is absurd, but the AAT said that, the way they make the definition, that is a mining process. No ordinary Australian would claim that that process is equivalent to mining in the common use of the word. So we have problems with the broad definitions being interpreted by the court. Therefore, the government's view was that we define much more clearly who is eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sweeper clauses that were put before you in the budget were aimed at ensuring that those people who were eligible within the original definitions continued to get the rebate. I accepted from the absolute beginning&mdash;and I told my officers this&mdash;that there was no doubt that senators and people with legitimate interests in this area would come forward with suggestions for further clarification and description of the definitions. I said, `We will have open discussion and bend over backwards to accept those definitions to ensure that all of those who had been getting the rebate scheme would continue to get it.' One thing we would not do is give new definitions to extend the scope of the scheme beyond what had already been operating for some 13 years. We made that very clear. </PARA>

I pay a compliment again&mdash;as Senator Crane did&mdash;to the work of my officers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no embarrassment to me that there are many pages of further amendments. I always said to my officers, `I don't care how many more pages of amendments we have to take, so long as the scheme is clear and understandable,' and we have achieved that through the sweeper clauses. But we reject the amendments to the sweeper clauses that extend the scope of the scheme into new areas, and we will vote against them. A number of the amendments that the opposition and the Greens have put forward clearly extend the scheme beyond its original operating capacity. We reject that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find it difficult to believe the opposition when it claims that we should reduce the outlays. It is now putting forward suggestions that we increase the outlays, thereby increasing government expenditure. The opposition told us that we had to reduce expenditure everywhere in the budget. We did not reduce it in this area; we just made sure that those who should get it, got it. The opposition has put up amendments that extend the scope of the scheme and which will cost the community and the taxpayers many tens of millions of dollars. That goes on the outlays. It is an increase in expenditure, and the government finds that unacceptable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we turn to the issue of retrospectivity. I understand that, quite rightly, a lot of people on both sides of the parliament are always very cautious about looking at issues of retrospectivity. We have put forward some proposals and, although some senators opposite are calling them `retrospective', in the normal sense of the word they are not retrospective&mdash;we are not going back to claim money off people retrospectively. What we are trying to do is ensure that, if we lose all the appeals, the money that the Fraser government and our government envisaged cannot be accessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you why. If we lose all the cases, between $160 million and $200 million will go off the budget. That is an increase in the outlays. Again, the opposition tells us that it is so concerned about reducing outlays and getting the expenditure down, but it is supporting retrospectivity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, let us turn to the operation of the principle of retrospectivity. In the lobbying that has been going on ever since the budget was announced last month, three major Australian companies have come to see me. They have been openly and publicly campaigning to have the retrospectivity&mdash;as you call it&mdash;rejected by the Senate. If it is rejected by the Senate and those three companies win the final appeals, at our best estimate they will have a windfall of $70 million plus&mdash;and that may be a conservative estimate. That is $70 million for three companies, and that amount goes right back to 1986 transactions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember this: regardless of whether those companies&mdash;CSR, Boral and Pioneer, and they have openly identified themselves&mdash;win in the courts and you defeat the bill in this area, they have already charged their customers at the full cost of the diesel they used in making that product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have they announced that if they are successful in getting this money, this windfall gain, they are going to redistribute it back to their customers whom they have already charged? Of course not. They have made no announcement to that effect. If they had announced, `If we win this all the way through and the Senate rejects the government's legislation, we will then reduce our prices for two years by 10 per cent so that the $70 million plus that we will get is redistributed to our customers,' they would have a bit better argument, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They want the taxpayer to give them a windfall gain. That is unacceptable to the government. They only put forward these claims in the last couple of years and have gone through the court. For several years they willingly paid the full excise on diesel. A number of consultants started going to them, saying, `If we win the case for you we'll have a success fee.' I understand the usual fee is about 25 per cent. So there is a pretty substantial consultants industry at work here, living off the fact that they can redistribute taxpayers' money retrospectively to their clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the fact that these companies have openly claimed they want this amendment defeated and because of the large amounts of money involved, I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that there are senators listed in the pecuniary interests document as having shares in CSR, Pioneer and Boral. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, this goes beyond that. Three companies have specifically campaigned to get this retrospective legislation, as you call it, defeated so that they get a windfall gain of $70 million after they have already charged their customers. I think it would only be appropriate for senators to declare their interests. Senator Watson, always a man of ethics, has already declared his interest&mdash;that he has shares in these companies. There are other opposition senators who have shares in these companies. I refer to the pecuniary interests document under the standing orders&mdash;the register of senators' interests. The fifth paragraph of the introduction is headed `Declaration of interests in debate in other proceedings'. I believe, as Senator Watson has already done, quite correctly, that those senators ought to declare their interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these companies distribute the windfall profit, if they end up getting it all, and then distribute it as profits to the shareholders, in view of that conflict of interest there is a very good case to be made that those senators should abstain from the vote on this clause. In this case we are dealing with three companies which will take over $70 million of taxpayers' money and are not going to distribute it back to their clients. So I draw the attention of the Senate to the pecuniary interests document under the standing orders. As Senator Watson has already declared his interest, I think it is only appropriate that the other senators do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that there are Labor senators and members who have shares in these companies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time bills pass through this place which may advantage all senators, as members of the community, in an indirect way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news story actually came in second. It informed the Australian public that a group of 45 people had been returned to China today by aircraft, bringing to a total of 173 the number of people who, initially, entered this country illegally by boat without any papers whatsoever and that now a further 45 of them have today been returned to their country. That is indeed very good news. It is certainly good news for the taxpayers of Australia. Since their arrival in around December of last year, it has cost the Australian taxpayer quite a deal of money to keep those people together in body and soul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bit of bad news that arrived two minutes earlier to this on the same wire service told the Australian public, and the Western Australian public in particular, about a rooftop demonstration taking place at the Port Hedland Detention Centre by a group of some 40 people who arrived in Australia on the boat <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jabiru</EMPHASIS> on Christmas Day last year, 25 December. The article said that there was concern by immigration department staff for the welfare of the people and, in particular, some five children that have been brought onto the rooftop in Port Hedland. The protesters have brought with them blankets, mattresses, food and water onto the roof. The demand, I am told, is that they want the boat in which they arrived illegally on our shores returned to them. Unfortunately, that will not be possible because the boat, as I am informed, has been destroyed. </PARA>

Sadly, some of these 50 have been held for more than five years. Since the Minister has discretion to give bridging visas to those held in long term detention, not doing so continues to give the impression that lengthy detention is a punishment for seeking redress in the courts for perceived injustices in the refugee determination process.</PARA>

But I do know that he, like many of his country people who previously arrived in Australia by boat and who subsequently did return to their home country of Cambodia, has the ability at any time of his choosing to return to Cambodia. His confinement at the Port Hedland Detention Centre is in fact his own doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the good fortune to talk to Father Larry at the refugee seminar in Canberra last week. He gave me a recipe to help ease the pain that I am feeling in my back. He was in the news recently when he was in Derby, which is a town in the north of Western Australia, my home state. He was there just prior to the time when 100 boat people, who were being held in a detention centre, decided that they did not want to remain there and knocked over the fence and walked out. According to newspaper reports, they remained at large for 5 hours. Father Larry had earlier addressed the people in the Curtin Detention Centre at Derby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking about this issue tonight, the point I want to make is that there seems to be an increasing tendency towards violence against the people who are detained in these two detention centres in the north west of my state. I am concerned about the protection of the individuals in those centres. Women and children are held in those centres and they may be vulnerable if there is violence. I am also concerned because there have been a number of escapes from the Curtin Detention Centre and the Port Hedland Detention Centre and the tighter security facility at Perth airport. I have grave fears that legal citizens of Australia might be hurt by these people who might feel desperate from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> there was an article entitled `Injuries in detainee lunch brawl'. This article told of an argument at the Port Hedland Detention Centre where people, including officers from the Australian Protective Services, were hurt. These are law abiding citizens who are trying to earn a quid by maintaining peace and security at that facility. It is not fair on them or their families that, in earning a living, they have to face the threat of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, the violence is at a very low level in Australia, but it is not at other detention centres in other parts of the region in which we live. We have seen spectacular coverage on television in recent months of 4,000 people breaking out of a camp in Kuala Lumpur. We have again seen further spectacular scenes of law enforcement officers at the Whitehead detention camp in Hong Kong who had to resort to the use of tear gas in order to control people who were rioting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only the Australian authorities but also the international community have done an enormous amount to help these very unfortunate people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here today a copy of a letter sent by Mr Stephen Martin MP, the Speaker of the House of Representatives. One would expect a certain standard from a member who holds that high office. Yet this is what he says to the secretary of the Wollongong Amateur Swimming Club in explaining why the swimming club will not be able to get any funding from the federal government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that throughout the entire time I have been an elected representative I have vigorously and consistently supported the improvement, establishment and development of sporting facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a Government Member I promoted the establishment and continued existence of the Community, Sporting, Recreation and Cultural Program as a funding source for regional sporting activities.</PARA>
<PARA>I am interested to see that Mr Martin is a strong supporter of the sports rorts. I suppose that anyone in the Labor Party would tend to adopt that approach, particularly those from the right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales, because it was a shonky deal. Get this bit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, due to the basic and crass politics of the Liberal Party over the so called "White Board Affair", this valuable funding program simply does not exist at the Federal Government Level.</PARA>
<PARA>Why not? This government cancelled it. This member very sensibly recognised that it was a shonky deal, and so it has ended. Mr Martin goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many projects such as your proposal which deserve funding and would be important additions to our sporting infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sadly, because of the bloody-minded attitude of the Liberal Party at the Federal Level it will have to fall to the State Government to fund a project of this nature.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me tell Mr Martin this: according to the secretary, the club has been trying to get funding for the last 40 years. The local members have made promises going back as far as 1954. In other words, the Labor government has had since 1983 to fund this project, but it decided it did not want to. Mr Martin's government took the view that, despite the fact that it was spending $62 million on this shonky deal, the Wollongong Amateur Swimming Club did not deserve any money whatsoever. </PARA>

It is about time Mr Martin faced up to the facts and stopped trying to blame the Liberal Party. For heavens sake, he is trying to blame us for Labor's shonky community, sporting, recreation and cultural program. The Labor Party got caught out with its fingers in the till. Up to $62 million was allocated on a whiteboard by a minister who pretended she did not know she was breaking the rules. She broke even their rules, and their rules are pretty ordinary. </PARA>

I think the rest of the Senate should be aware of the tactics that Labor people are using in this dishonest way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that all senators would endorse my belief that a fundamental tenet of our Western legal system&mdash;whether it is Australia, Britain or the United States&mdash;is access to legal representation and advice in an equitable way. Recent events in New South Wales, however, raise serious questions about the power of large corporations such as Telstra to limit the access to legal services by the community. This issue is of such grave implication that it should be investigated by the Trade Practices Commission or at least the Attorney-General's Department. The story starts with the New South Wales Public Interest Advocacy Centre, which is a clearing house for public interest legal matters. The PIAC Bulletin No. 5 of May-June 1995 reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In seeking to assist one public interest, the Clearing House has been beset by obstacles which deserve investigation in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A resident group concerned about the health implications of a telecommunications development in their area sought assistance to challenge the development, which is adjacent to a kindergarten, baby health centre and residential premises. The CSIRO has released a report substantiating some of the health concerns raised by the residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attempts by the Clearing House to secure legal advice for the group were met with rejection from 12 member firms. According to the firms, the corporation in question has an arrangement with 43 law firms whereby the firms undertake not to act against it in any matter in return for receiving some part of its legal budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result: any person attempting to obtain redress against an activity of the corporation which appears to offend the public interest, is denied access to lawyers with relevant experience.</PARA>
<PARA>As I suggested, this raises the serious issue of the power of corporations to affect the access to legal services by the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office contacted the Public Interest Advocacy Centre on 23 June and, after receiving permission from their client, the Harbord Residents Group, was told that the corporation in question was Telstra and that the offending development was a mobile phone base station, a transmitting tower. What is Telstra so worried about? Is it just a few local community groups opposing the siting of a few transmitting towers? Or does it have more serious concerns?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has recently been reported that the Warringah council has received a $20,000 contribution from Optus after it did not object to the company building a telecommunications base station at the Forestville War Memorial Playing Fields. In November last year I tabled in this chamber a draft report on problems associated with electromagnetic radiation. That report referred to the research into the health effects of electromagnetic radiation from a variety of sources, including video display units, fluorescent lights and electrical transmission lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A follow-up report, to be released soon, refers to the increasing litigation that is occurring against cellular telephone manufacturers. Overseas, brain tumour claims are `popping up everywhere now', according to attorney Bruce Goodhart of Holstein, Mack and Klein from Chicago in the United States, as quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Microwave News</EMPHASIS> of November-December 1994. According to the cover story, entitled `Why electromagnetic field litigation could be the next asbestos', in the January 1994 Journal of the American Bar Association:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presently, more studies exist that appear to link EMF exposure to an increased risk of cancer than existed linking asbestos exposure to an increased risk of cancer at a similar embryonic stage of asbestos litigation.</PARA>
<PARA>Telstra and other carriers are not ignorant of these events taking place in the US and they have a valid right to be concerned about possible litigation. But to attempt to redress this threat by limiting the access to legal services by the community is an horrendous action and we should be very much aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this practice is allowed to continue, we can expect other industrial groups to copy the strategy. I can well imagine that suppliers and manufacturers of agricultural chemicals, for example, may find it advantageous to jump on the bandwagon as well, attempting to limit the public's access to the opportunity to seek legal redress. This practice needs to be well aired in this chamber. The debate needs to be seriously considered. The practice needs careful scrutiny by this chamber and any other forum in which it can be exposed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of what I was saying is this: there is a variety of privileges and rights that have to, at times, be balanced against each other. Clearly, the way the constitution is established, the division of chapters flowing from the constitution of the United States of America, means that one branch of government should not readily intrude on another. That has been made most clear by the judiciary in a series of cases&mdash;for example, the boilermakers case and, more recently, the Brandy case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Logically, there must be a division of powers between the executive and the legislature. When demanding documents, the legislature has to be mindful of executive privilege and should not lightly set that aside. In other words, it should only do so for good reason. The point I was making today in respect of Dr Lawrence was that all the facts that are needed for this chamber to take such actions as it will against the minister are already known; namely, a royal commission is inquiring into her alleged conduct in the past when she was a member of the Western Australian legislature, and the government has decided to finance her legal costs, as I understand it, not only for the royal commission but also in respect of any challenge she may make through the processes of the court. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments tonight on the accreditation of child-care centres. It is important to note that after Friday, 30 June, those centres that have not registered for accreditation will begin to lose their fee relief. In this chamber we have discussed at length the problems associated with accreditation and the forced adherence to the arbitrary and ridiculous guidelines which centres must follow in order to receive a standard to guarantee accreditation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, has prevaricated on the question of cost: sometimes saying that accreditation would cost no more than 88c per child per week and later suggesting that she did not know in fact how much accreditation was likely to cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had a study done by Coopers and Lybrand, the results of which were released today. This study has borne out coalition concerns about the additional time and money which the system requires. Getting parents to become involved in the process, the extra paperwork, the pressure on staff, and the hurdle of getting started were noted as difficulties contained within the system. The subjectivity of the principles which determine accreditation and the background of reviewers were also highlighted as other subjects of concern to centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this process the coalition has expressed a great deal of concern about the draconian nature of this legislation. The big stick approach, whereby parents and children will lose fee relief if the centre owner does not register for accreditation, is totally abhorrent. The minister quotes that 94 per cent of centres have been accredited, and has also said on occasion that centres are cheerfully embracing accreditation as an attractive and constructive process. I ask the minister how many centres have not happily and cheerfully embraced accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the number of accredited centres is high: the government is threatening child-care proprietors with the loss of their livelihood if they do not become accredited. Under similar circumstances most people would submit to such measures irrespective of whether they support them. I have had many letters from child-care proprietors and I would like to read to the Senate a letter I received from the director of the Jolly Frog Kindergarten in New South Wales, Ms Eileen Byrnes. She is writing to Quentin Bryce who is the chairman of the National Childcare Accreditation Council. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Quentin</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to your phone call 27-6-95, please find enclosed registration form, cheque for $100.00 and self study report in the name of the Jolly Frog Kindergarten.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand and object strenuously to the fact that we are forced to take part in this process to protect our children's parent's income related subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are registering at the very last minute also as a form of protest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We request that our long standing opposition to the link to C.C.A. through this process be brought to the attention of the Commonwealth Minister for Family Services, Senator Rosemary Crowley once again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not feel that it is appropriate that the parent's of our attending children should be threatened with losing the  Child Care Assistance if our centre is not complying.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe it is disgraceful and immoral that our compliance or noncompliance will have a direct effect on our client's income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our centre has a long standing reputation for high quality care and education. We find it irritating, to say the least, that some bureaucrat will come into our centre once every one, two or three years to tell us we are good bad, or indifferent. One wonders why we bother to do any training</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We feel we no longer run, own or direct a private centre. We have become a government run institution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Move over big brother!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish our opposition to the cost of this program to be registered also. We believe the Minister has wasted taxpayer's funds on a totally useless exercise that will not make one jot of difference to centres not supplying quality care and has increased paper work, stress and expense for those that are.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also object to the fact that the rules of entry for children are being changed at the whim of government officials and we put this government on notice that if they continue to discriminate against children because of their parent's employment situation they will have a fight on their hands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I request that this letter be read in both houses of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours faithfully</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eileen Byrnes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Director.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter is representative of a large number of child-care centre owners in Australia. I received earlier today a letter from a Mr Bruce Lizotte, expressing the same sentiments. Concern for the parents is prompting some child-care centre owners to register for accreditation. Centre owners feel very uncertain about the whole process. I have had representation from other centres who, up to a few weeks ago, had not received responses to queries about the cut-off date and likely ramifications. The head of the National Child-care Accreditation Council, Ms Quentin Bryce, has been calling child-care centre proprietors around the country trying to heavy-hand them into registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I state that the coalition is not opposed to the concept of quality assurance and standards of care, per se. On the contrary, the coalition is completely cognisant of the importance of high standards of care for children. What we are opposed to, however, is the coercion of child-care centre proprietors to register for accreditation through the removal of child-care assistance. </PARA>
