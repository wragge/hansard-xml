<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because it is an issue which is controversial, pursuant to contingent notice standing in the name of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill), I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Baume moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion No. 1862 standing in the name of Senator Baume for this day, relating to an order for the production of documents by the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator McMullan).</PARA>
<PARA>I do that because this is a matter of significant controversy. This is a matter which has received enormous publicity. This is a matter which does not go in any way to the capacity, talent, skill, or enormous achievements of Mrs Churcher, who has been reappointed as Director of the National Gallery of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This goes to the credibility of the government, the credibility of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and the credibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the sense that they have interfered in the selection process in a way that has damaged Australia's standing in the art world. That is not simply my judgment: that is the judgment of many people, some of whom have been quoted in newspaper reports. Editorials have been prompted on the unfortunate nature of the ministerial intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, and has never been denied, that the selection panel appointed to find a new Director of the National Gallery of Australia on the retirement of Mrs Churcher at age 65 unanimously recommended Mr Lloyd. The Hon. Lionel Bowen, a former Labor Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, was chairman of that committee. The minister chose to ignore the recommendation. He says he never received that recommendation. Quite frankly, that may be the official truth but the unofficial lie because he asked not to be given that recommendation and so the department did not pass it on to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an incredible situation. It is incredible on lots of scores. I and Senator Chapman have moved in this place amendments to various acts, including, I might say, the National Gallery Act, relating to the age limit of 65. In other words, had our amendments been passed, then this issue may never have arisen. But it has arisen and the fact is that a selection committee found unanimously that Mr Lloyd should be made the director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no comment, and I do not wish to comment, on whether that was a good or bad recommendation. What concerns me is the manner in which this government intervened in this process. It is all very well to say it is up to the minister to make the appointment. But we had a unanimous recommendation by a selection panel&mdash;in this case, as I said, chaired by a former Deputy Prime Minister of this country&mdash;which was ignored, which was treated with contempt and which has damaged the status of Mr Lloyd. What sort of position is he in now? Unanimously recommended, but unacceptable to this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to know, what this Senate needs to know and what the Australian people need to know&mdash;certainly evidenced from the volume of press interest and correspondence to the editor&mdash;is exactly what happened. Did the minister advise the department not to give him the unanimous recommendation of the selection panel? If not, why did the department choose not to give it to him? What have the minister and the department got to hide?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps even more significant, we all know that the Prime Minister of this nation likes to dabble in things artistic&mdash;certainly, French clocks and Mahler. What role did he play in this? Would Mr Lee have done this on his own? We all know that Mrs Churcher, who is a fine woman, is a personal friend of the Prime Minister. I hope that was not a factor in this matter. But we must know to what extent Mr Lee was simply the monkey and the Prime Minister the organ-grinder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is vital that this matter, which has damaged Australia's reputation and which has raised question marks over the National Gallery of Australia, should be resolved, and it should be resolved by providing this Senate with the documents. That is why I have moved this motion. I think it is a very important matter and it should be resolved as quickly as possible. I have asked that the relevant documents be laid on the table as soon as practicable after the Senate resumes on 13 November 1995. </PARA>

Before seeking leave for the amended motion to be taken as formal, Senator Baume was on his feet moving a motion to suspend standing orders. That in itself, I might say, is extraordinary.

<PARA>That is on the `Order of business'. Then there is the additional point that leave was sought by Senator Baume, and that leave was granted, to amend the motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do think there has been some failure of communication. Senator Bourne is correct in saying that we, for our part, undertook to seek further instructions. Nonetheless, the fact remains that this matter has been under active consideration at the whips' meetings. All parties have been aware that it has been our intention to bring the matter on for debate. It certainly has been a matter of very active public controversy. The government is fully aware of the extent to which this matter has been canvassed in the media and the fact that we have been anxious to have these documents tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what Senator Bourne says is generally correct. I would concede that, even though the amendments that Senator Baume made by leave this morning were entirely inconsequential and technical, the fact is that it appears on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> giving the formal impression that the matter was not going to be taken at this point in time. </PARA>

Can I therefore suggest that we deal with this matter at a later hour this day. I would suggest 12 noon because that gives the government ample opportunity. There is no need for any extra preparation, I might say. All we are doing is agreeing that, because of the precise form in which this matter has come forward, it makes sense to allow a period of time to elapse. But I would not have thought they needed more than half an hour to get themselves together, if they have not already. </PARA>

If it is put off until after question time, then it eats into general business, and I do not think that is desirable either. I think it would be much better, quicker and cleaner if we could have the matter dealt with at 12 noon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority for the moment is to say, `What is the proper way to deal with this matter on a subsequent occasion?' I think we are all agreed now that it will be a subsequent occasion, although we are not quite agreed about when it will be that we will talk about the substance, which I do not think will be all that difficult. I do not see that dealing with the substance of this matter is likely to be all that difficult, although I have to qualify that in one way&mdash;I still actually do not know the final form of words that is being proposed. That is the only qualification I have for saying that I think the substance will be easy to deal with, and it summarises the procedural problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being asked to agree to a motion when we do not know what it says. I am not going to do that, and you cannot blame anyone on this side for not doing that&mdash;although I do believe that we will get some reasonably easy resolution of the substance, probably with no debate. I cannot give that guarantee because I have not seen the actual words, but I think that it would probably be with no debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while I do not think it is going to unreasonably eat into general business&mdash;and we would obviously not get support to do that if we wanted to, but we do not have any desire to do that; it is not a problem for us in terms of the amount of time available for general business&mdash;I think the only reasonable proposal now is that which the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner), in his usual delicate way, suggested by interjection, which is that we might deal with it directly after motions to take note of answers. I do indicate that we will make every effort to make that an agreed matter that will take no further time. I cannot guarantee it, but I think we can do that, and I will seek to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I do not know whether, Mr Acting Deputy President, you want me to suggest that that would be an amendment with regard to time relating to the motion of which Senator Alston has, in effect, given notice, or whether you will simply require us to vote on Senator Alston's motion and then move a subsequent one, or whether procedurally we are better to have Senator Alston's motion withdrawn and move a subsequent agreed motion to deal with the first item after the taking note of answers. Under any of those three procedures, I am sure we can take the procedural issues out of this debate and get to the substance, which I think, with a little bit of time and courtesy, we can then resolve quite simply. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate, indeed the whole parliament and informed people of Australia, have been for many years now enormously concerned about the transgressions against human rights in the country of Burma. In this chamber alone about 20 senators, at one time or another in the last seven years, have expressed very real concern at developments there, with the suspension of democracy and the persecution of the elected majority from the 1990 election and, in particular, of the leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Senator Hill and Senator Schacht have for many years expressed their concerns about developments in Burma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, two years ago, Senator Chamarette gave a notice of motion that eventually became a formal motion of this chamber. It was passed by all of us. With great conscience and without controversy, it was adopted. The terms of that motion drew attention to the lack of democracy and the transgression of human rights in Burma. As is our norm, the President of the Senate&mdash;and Senator Beahan was a former member of the Human Rights Subcommittee&mdash;passed on that resolution to the Burmese ambassador in Canberra, U Saw Tun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ambassador replied. His reply was not to the satisfaction of the Senate. The reply is set out in the introduction to the report. The Senate did not allow the inadequate response from the representative of that country to be received and noted without comment. Accordingly, Senator Reid moved a motion, which was supported by all senators, that the original resolution and the response of the Burmese ambassador be referred to the Human Rights Subcommittee for inquiry and report. This was in March last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 18 months we have carried out a very thorough inquiry. I wish to commend particularly those senators who attended almost every meeting and who were very active. I refer to Senator Harradine and Senator Bourne, who are in the chamber. Senator Margetts, Senator Reynolds, Senator Denman and others were also involved and should also be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the inquiry I had the honour to be the deputy chairman. The chairman at the beginning was former Senator Loosley. I admire the tenacity with which he went about the conduct of this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now published a thorough report on the situation in Burma. I have here a huge pile of paper which includes material that was before the United Nations, before the Human Rights Commission and before the ILO. It is a very sorry picture that is described of refugees displaced out of Burma and into Thailand; out of Burma and into Bangladesh; forced labour; and military interventions into every part of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is most offensive not only to the Senate, Australia and the Australian government but to the general international community. I say that because of the United Nations resolutions that continued to be passed while that situation remained in Burma. The international community took great offence at a military group taking control of the country. That group was called the SLORC, the State Law and Order Restoration Council. What a parody of words in the title of the present de facto government of Burma!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the election in 1990, the National League for Democracy, as led by Aung San Suu Kyi, had the support of the people. That explains why we have a photograph of the elected leader of the people of Burma on the cover of our report. We have references in our 38 recommendations to the need for her to be immediately involved in negotiations with the SLORC and for there to be a full restoration of government in Burma by allowing the elected parliamentarians to take their place in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not see this as a simplistic matter. It is not a matter of waving a flag and everything will be ordered in this part of the world. We truly acknowledge in the report that Burma is a country on the edge. It has a large border with China and a large border with India. This is the country in Indo-China that has been most cut off from the rest of the world from the time of its independence in 1947. Burma has a geography which makes unity, order and democratic government somewhat difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous range of languages in Burma. Everybody speaks in common parlance of the Shan, Chin, Karan, Kachin and other minority groups that are calling for a federation style approach to solutions for Burma. The jungle borders with Thailand are of enormous physical difficulty to Burma, as is the interior of the country. The problems are not the result of the ageless circumstances of the people of Burma; they are, we believe, the direct outcome of the suspension of democracy and the policies of the SLORC that trespass upon every field of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1940s, the world community adopted the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. That has stood ever since. We see this as the most relevant document to judge the situation in Burma. It is because of this failure in every area of human rights that we again draw to the attention of the Senate, the people of Australia and the international community this assessment of the need for continuing action by the international community to see restoration of democracy and the end to these transgressions against human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some 38 recommendations in the report which are all addressed to the Australian government. The committee has looked favourably upon the benchmarks policy of the Australian government. In appendix 10 we have an outline of the benchmarks that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, has outlined and which he has argued in ASEAN and international forums as being the appropriate preconditions for any more positive relations with the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time forbids me to say more than that. I note the careful work and excellent contributions to this report of our secretary, Margaret Swieringa. I thank all the members of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for what is a substantial report that must be given very careful attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I probably agree with pretty well everything that Senator Teague has said about this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I believe it is a very good report. It is one of our shorter reports. We generally take a lot longer to go through things. There was an enormous amount of evidence. Almost all of the evidence, with the exception of four or five submissions, pointed to the fact that there is a major problem in Burma today and that these are certainly the worst problems in South-East Asia today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very obvious that Burma is a country where there is very clear delineation between right and wrong. In South-East Asia it is probably the clearest we are going to see. The committee's conclusions are all very strong and I think that says something. This committee is comprised of members from the wide spectrum that we see in this parliament. We all agreed on several things, and I will just quote a couple. The first line of the first conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reports continue to be made of gross human rights abuses in Burma, `consistently and on a wide scale.'</PARA>
<PARA>We heard an awful lot of those. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gap between the statements made by various representatives of the Burmese Government and the actual conditions of life for ordinary Burmese people appears to be very wide.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is putting it very diplomatically. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the problems that arise for states because of the demands by minority groups for self-determination and independence . . . this issue alone represents one of the major security issues facing the world today.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly nobody could disagree with that one. The final conclusion I will quote states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, since the SLORC deprived the elected government of power in 1990, most of the gross human rights abuses committed by the Government result from that act of illegality, the opposition it has engendered and the systematic attempts of the SLORC to destroy the National League for Democracy and any political opposition to its rule. The Government lacks accountability; its rule is arbitrary; it has dispensed with a rule of law and has resorted to rule by decree. There has been little progress towards democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have to agree with that. At the moment the constitutional convention amounts to a farce. It will have to be very substantially changed before the international community will accept any findings that it comes up with. I believe this is a very good report. I would also like to thank Margaret Swieringa, our secretary, who has done an excellent job on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to make one final comment before Senator Margetts speaks. Senator Margetts has put in a dissenting report to this report. I feel I really ought to defend myself and other members of the committee. I do not believe that what Senator Margetts has put in her dissenting report is actually a dissent. I think we would all agree with pretty well everything she has put in it. It is a pity she is not on the Human Rights Subcommittee because I am sure she would have a lot of very interesting and good input, as we see by this report. I do not believe it is a dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just go through a couple of things she said. Her first recommendation is about ministerial level contact, which is already government policy and we mention that in the report. I think it is a good policy. I do not think there should be ministerial level contact except in very exceptional circumstances such as going to see Aung San Suu Kyi, which I think would be a good thing. Apart from that, no, I do not see why there should be any ministerial level contact and I do not think anybody else on the committee does either. I think that fact came out quite clearly in our committee's deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her second recommendation is in fact one of our conclusions, so we agree absolutely on that one. There is no question there. The third recommendation is an interesting one on heroin and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Australian government inform the public of the major sources of heroin being imported into Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If that recommendation had been brought up to the committee, and it is one that I accept we did not think of, certainly I would say it would have been agreed to by every member of the committee. I think it is a very good one and I wish it had been brought up so we could have agreed to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not brought up before the committee because Senator Margetts is not on the committee. If she were, and if she had brought this up, I am sure we would have agreed to it. I would have agreed to it. I imagine Senator Harradine would have agreed to it. I cannot imagine Senator Teague disagreeing to it. It is a good recommendation. The next recommendation states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the event that government officials plan to visit Burma, such visits are predicated . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is good too, but we do not have any government officials planning to visit Burma. That is a good thing too. I would rather we did not have any government officials visiting Burma. They do not at the moment and they do not intend to. I think that is very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation No. 5 is one of the recommendations of our last report. It would have been a very good idea to have put it into this report. I wish we had. It is one of our recommendations, and we agree with it. The country economic brief on Burma should be withdrawn. We deal with it under chapter 6. We disagreed with that country economic brief. Every country economic brief should include human rights information; that is one thing that we all agreed on in this report. I hope that that happens in country economic briefs around the world when they deal with Australia as well as every other country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I quite like recommendation No. 6. It is quite a good recommendation. But the issue did not arise in any of the evidence, so we just did not deal with it in the inquiry. But it is rather a nice recommendation. If we had heard anything about the issue, I would have agreed with it. I will make one point to defend myself. I will do it before Senator Margetts gets up so that she can get stuck into me if she feels like it. I believe that she has not put in a dissenting report. It is like a personal report. I would quite like to have put in one myself. It does not dissent from what we have said. It agrees with what we have said, and extends it in a couple of areas. One area that it extends it in is an area that we did not cover. We had no evidence on it. But it was a good idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like people to know when they are reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>and this report that the committee does not disagree with what Senator Margetts said. Senator Margetts has put in an extra report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not at the main committee meeting because I cannot get to them. I have a standing committee meeting then. Senator Margetts is telling me that the main committee disagreed with every one of them. I find that very difficult to accept, especially since three of them are our recommendations. It demonstrates a real problem with the joint foreign affairs committee system in that it has to go through so many levels of agreement. When you have unanimous support for something at one level, it is very difficult when you then have to go to another level and get unanimous support there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with everything in this report, including what Senator Margetts is dissenting from. I do not believe that it dissents from anything the Human Rights Subcommittee has put in this report. I do not believe that Senator Margetts is dissenting from what the rest of us on the Human Rights Subcommittee have written in this report. I agree with everything in the entire report, including what Senator Margetts has said. I imagine that most members of the Human Rights Subcommittee would, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish by saying that there was little disagreement in the evidence on the way that Burma should be handled. I hope that the government and the opposition, as a possible future government, will take a great deal of notice of this. Last week, I was at a symposium on Burma, as Senator Chamarette was. I was a bit surprised by the comments made there about Burma by a member of the opposition. I hope that the foreign minister in the next government&mdash;be it the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), a member of the opposition, another member of the current government, or me&mdash;will take everything in this document into account when they decide what Australia's view will be on Burma in the next government. This is a very comprehensive document about what ought to be, and currently is, Australia's view on Burma. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Bourne has mentioned, I have included in this report on Burma a report which is marked as a dissent. It is probably more correctly a qualifying statement. I appreciate the work that the committee and the committee secretary have done in producing this report. It was by degree. I was reluctant to change a report that was produced by a committee. I understand Senator Bourne's comment that being on a defence and trade subcommittee on one's own is perhaps an even more different experience. Support on those issues would also be nice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But support is not always possible. As someone from the government said yesterday, `We only have 19 backbenchers, Senator, to attend all the committees.' I said, `Talk to me about it. We have two for front and backbench work.' It is very difficult to even cover the vast array of committee work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as a matter of degree and even definition, the government appears to have shied away from the term `constructive engagement'; but that, in fact, is what we are seeing in Australia's changing relationship with Burma. And that is the level of concern which I have endeavoured to express. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, there was a difference of opinion on whether or not it is better to have engagement at a ministerial level at forums. The trouble is, if Burma is invited to a number of the forums, including ASEAN, such an invitation legitimises the SLORC government. That really sends the wrong signal&mdash;the same kind of signal as that sent by a former Prime Minister who travelled to that country. That trip was used considerably by SLORC and waved around as a symbol of their legitimacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An invitation to SLORC to attend ASEAN is a two-edged sword. We would tend to come down on the other side: by inviting SLORC to ASEAN, you give them the legitimacy they crave. That will not necessarily help restoration of a legitimate government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still an Austrade office in Burma. Despite all the rhetoric about Australia not trading with Burma, I can see no reason why we should have both an Austrade office and two staff. I understand they are local staff, but we have heard again and again from Austrade that there is a very small Austrade dollar which we have to use very wisely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retention of local staff is not a reason to keep an office open where we have no official trade relationship with a country. If we do not have a relationship, then we do not have an Austrade office. If we have an Austrade office, even if we do not have an Australian representative on it, then we send the signal that we are keeping the doors open on trade development. At this stage, that is the wrong signal when we have seen no real movements towards establishing the democratic process and improving human rights in Burma. That is why the statement was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the reference to an inquiry to create a code of practice, such a reference to the subcommittee might have been good. However, it is an effort to make a positive contribution for the future and it is something that may be picked up and worked on by government&mdash;and we hope that it will be. It is more a qualifying statement and a matter of degree. It is more a case of being a little stronger in some of the recommendations because of concern that the wrong interpretation may be taken by SLORC through limited engagement being interpreted as a recognition of legitimacy by the SLORC government in its current form. </PARA>

<PARA>The report, which is the 339th tabled by the committee since 1951, presents an overview of the committee's activities for the last financial year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee began the practice of presenting annual reports to parliament in 1976. The committee's decision to prepare annual reports was explained in the 1979 annual report in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reporting this way to Parliament, the Committee has recognised its responsibility as a statutory body to report on its activities. This Committee has always taken the view that bodies established by the Parliament should report to the Parliament and has been the vanguard of encouraging increased standards and regularity in reporting.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement is still valid now. The last year has been particularly busy for the committee. During the year it has tabled seven reports, which was two more than in the previous financial year. The most significant report tabled was report 331, which contains results of the committee's review of the package of three bills intended to replace the Audit Act 1991 and of the committee's consideration of the government's proposal to establish an audit committee of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 331 contained 39 recommendations to further enhance this package. The committee was gratified to see that the government adopted the vast majority of those recommendations. Senators will know that some 13 months after the tabling of the committee's report the three bills and the motion to establish an audit committee are still to be debated in parliament. They contain a number of contentious issues: firstly, the Auditor-General's mandate to conduct performance audits in government business enterprises; the extent of the parliament's involvement in the appointed process for auditors-general and the most important form for an audit committee; and, finally, certain provisions relating to the disclosure of sensitive information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee remains of the view that the recommendations in report 331 are sensible and constructive solutions that should be further considered and potentially taken up. The parliament has before it a rare opportunity to modernise the Commonwealth's financial management and accountability framework. If we cannot reach agreement on the outstanding matters in the next two weeks and enact the legislation before the end of this session in parliament, the opportunity will pass. This will be a great tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the upcoming election and the uncertain legislative priorities in the new government, the reforms contained in the bills will go unmade until at least July 1997 and could potentially be abandoned altogether. Delay of this magnitude would be detrimental to the good management of the Commonwealth and public accountability. However, whatever the eventual outcome of the debates in the Senate and the House, the committee considers that its review demonstrates that the parliamentary committees can play a valuable role and that contributions to the legislative process can help ensure that legislation is of the highest quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the year the committee also tabled report 336, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest: An inquiry into commercialisation in the Commonwealth public sector.</EMPHASIS> In this major report, the committee concluded that commercialisation and corporatisation have led to major improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness with which Commonwealth agencies provide goods and services. However, the committee found that commercialisation has not been without its costs and in some cases the transition could have been managed in a better way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reports tabled during the year cover a diverse range of topics, including the use of the Australian government credit card by Commonwealth agencies, the sale of Aussat and best practice for the sale of Commonwealth assets and, finally, the construction and acquisition of six new Collins class submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also active during the year with several ongoing and new inquiries into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements, specific purpose payments, cash management in the public sector, accrual reporting, whole-of-government reporting and fiscal responsibility legislation. Reports for some of these inquiries have now been tabled and it is planned to table reports for the remainder of the inquiries before the end of this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major highlight of the committee's year was a visit to New Zealand as part of the committee exchange program established by the Australian and New Zealand parliaments. The centrepiece of the visit was a meeting between the committee delegation and the New Zealand parliament's equivalent of the JCPA, the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The meeting provided the delegation with an overseas perspective on some of the common issues facing the two committees. Discussions evolved around the role of committees in the New Zealand parliament; New Zealand's experience of public sector reforms; and the relationship between parliaments and their auditors-general. I must say on a personal note that it was particularly valuable in terms of our discussions on accrual accounting and fiscal responsibility, which are matters which we are currently considering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in New Zealand, the committee delegation also met with a number of other individuals and organisations. The purpose of these additional meetings was to gain a New Zealand perspective on some of the issues facing the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its inquiries in Australia. In summary, the opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest with our counterparts in the New Zealand Finance and Expenditure Committee and a great number of public and private sector representatives was invaluable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another activity in which the committee has been involved is a watching brief over the tax law improvement project.

<PARA>On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, it gives me great pleasure today to table the committee's 340th report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cash Matters: Cash Management in the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>. This report is the result of the committee's review of two reports presented to the parliament by the Auditor-General. The first report was Audit Report No. 22, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency Audit,  Cash Management in Commonwealth Government Departments</EMPHASIS> and the second report was Audit Report No. 10, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Efficiency Audit, Cash Management in Commonwealth Government Departments</EMPHASIS>. Both audit reports resulted from the same performance audit, the first being an interim report and the second being the final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's decision to review these reports was influenced by the same reasons which caused the Auditor-General to conduct the audit: firstly, that the Commonwealth manages huge amounts of cash each year; and secondly, that any improvements in cash management practices would potentially result in substantial dollar savings. In a nutshell, good cash management endeavours to match patterns of expenditure with patterns of revenue. In the Commonwealth, responsibility for this task is shared between individual agencies with deliver programs or collect revenues and the central economic agencies&mdash;the Department of Finance and the Treasury&mdash;which are involved in forecasting overall cash needs and engaging in short-term borrowing when cash holdings are predicted to be insufficient to cover forthcoming payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When short-term borrowings are made, the Commonwealth incurs an interest expense known as public debt interest expenditure. In recent years, transactions to fund public debt interest have been the single biggest source of real growth in Commonwealth outlays. The budget papers for this financial year, 1995-96, show that the past two years have seen such expenditure grow from $6.6 billion to $10.08 billion this financial year. At the strategic level, good cash management involves the prompt banking of Commonwealth revenues and the development of payment schedules which recognise opportunity costs and revenue peaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scale of the task is immense: in 1995-96 the Commonwealth's revenue is expected to total $110 billion, while outlays are expected to amount to $122 billion. Figures like this merely confirm that there is a need to pay special attention to cash management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the revenue side, it is important that the Australian Taxation Office and the other revenue agencies have sophisticated systems in place to quickly process and bank incoming receipts, which in peak periods can amount to more than $1 billion per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the expenditure side, Commonwealth agencies need to pay far more attention than they have in the past to making payments in a way which not only meets the Commonwealth's program objectives but at the same time protects the Commonwealth's financial interests. This is true both of the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays and of the Commonwealth's payments to the states, which in this financial year amount to $34.2 billion, or a little less than one-third of the total outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's current inquiry into the administration of specific purpose payments to the states has drawn attention to the significant cash management implications of these payments. There is ample evidence, for example, that by making special purpose payments before they are needed for program purposes, the states are able to invest the money and make significant interest windfalls. In effect, this is a form of hidden subsidy to the states. It is an issue I expect the committee to return to in the report of its SPP inquiry, which will be tabled before the end of the current parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which is crucial for effective cash management is the need to accurately forecast cash flows. It is this activity which enables the containment of public debt interest expenditure. The committee has recommended the establishment of a series of cash forecasting benchmarks based on national and international best practice in both the public and private sectors. Treasury should also routinely monitor and evaluate its cash forecasting performance against these best practice benchmarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a great number of agency level functions which can have a marked aggregated impact across the Commonwealth. These agency level functions include: negotiation of prepayment terms, particularly for specific purpose payments to the states and territories; invoicing promptly for goods and services sold; expediting collection of amounts due; purchasing goods or services later without jeopardising program objectives; negotiating more favourable purchase payment terms; reducing the amount of inventory held; spreading payment terms; and paying invoices only when they fall due. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key message is that all agencies have a role in maximising the Commonwealth's cash management outcomes. Only efficient and effective management of these day-to-day functions by departments will achieve the levels of cash balances necessary to minimise borrowing and subsequently the net public debt interest cost to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth agencies maintain over 2,000&mdash;that is correct&mdash;bank accounts. It was of great concern to the committee that the Audit Office had discovered that several agencies were unaware of the number of accounts they maintained. It is an essential discipline that proper bank account records be kept. To do otherwise is an indicator of extreme laxity on the part of agency managers and exposes Commonwealth funds to significant risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering how cash management might be improved across all Commonwealth agencies, the committee came to the view that the potential for savings, the number of issues involved in good cash management and the absence of any whole of government monitoring or analysis pointed to the need for increased central focus in the Commonwealth, at least in the short term. Accordingly, the committee recommends in this report that Finance should play a more prominent role in providing guidance for line agencies as well as in the monitoring, analysis and reporting of cash management performance on a Commonwealth-wide basis. The central focus on cash management recommended in the report could result in Finance performing a corporate treasury function for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues to emerge during the committee's review was whether or not the group of accounts maintained by the Commonwealth at the Reserve Bank and used for the targeting of cash balances was the most appropriate. Evidence provided to the committee suggested that in practice the target group of accounts has already been expanded by Treasury to include the overdraft group. As this wider group is the one which is used by the Reserve Bank to calculate the Commonwealth's interest bill, it seems logical to the committee that the target group should be formally expanded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An associated, and perhaps more important, issue is that of the level of balances in these target accounts. The government decided in 1989 that the average cumulative balances in the target accounts should be maintained in the $0-300 million range. The committee believes there is now scope to further refine this target range, towards the lower end, thus providing additional savings. The committee recommends that Finance and Treasury should discuss and agree on optimal cash balances or, alternatively, that the issue be resolved by a review process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the final issue. In the audit reports, the Auditor-General pointed to areas where better cooperation between Finance and Treasury could result in an improved cash management performance. Report 340 looks in more depth at this relationship between these two key central agencies. The report reflects the concerns of committee members that a number of important issues which appear to have been under discussion or review for some years have yet to be satisfactorily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to the committee that better cooperation and communication between these two agencies could have seen a number of these issues resolved some time ago, with consequent benefit to the Commonwealth. Whilst both the committee and the Auditor-General acknowledge that there has been improvement in the working relationship between Finance and Treasury since the audit began, the committee believes there is scope for further cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the range and significant nature of the issues requiring resolution, the committee recommends that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) should commission a high level review of cash management in the Commonwealth. The review team should: (a) have a chairman from the private sector with expertise in corporate Treasury functions; (b) consist of senior representatives from the Departments of Finance and the Treasury; (c) include a senior representative of the Australian National Audit Office as a member of the review team or as an observer; (d) focus on the cash management issues which remain unresolved; and (e) report within six months of being established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that such an externally-led review will enable a fresh perspective to be brought to the issues&mdash;a perspective unencumbered by inter-agency sensitivities. This is an important recommendation dealing with an important issue. The size of the Commonwealth's public debt interest bill and the potential savings which could flow from better cash management are too big to ignore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to express our thanks to those people who contributed to the review by preparing submissions and giving evidence at the public hearings. I would also like to thank the staff of the secretariat for assisting the committee in preparing the report. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING (AUSTRALIAN-RESIDENT SEAFARERS) GRANTS BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to an important element in the Government's package of shipping reform measures which was announced in the Budget on 9 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform package continues the improvement in efficiency and competitiveness of Australia's major trading fleet, and assists in closing the competitive gap between Australian shipping and its major international competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australia's international shipping industry employers, based on the PAYE tax liabilities of seafarers on Australia's international trading ships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the introduction of the grant under this bill, the reform package includes two other key elements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the extension from 1 July 1997 until 30 June 2002 of the existing capital assistance measures available under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 and the associated accelerated depreciation regime under section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These measures, which at least equate to the capital incentives provided by other shipping nations, will encourage the continued investment in modern ships. The necessary amendments to the two acts will be introduced in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the implementation of the complementary industry efficiency reform measures developed by the shipowners and maritime unions in the Maritime Industry Restructuring Agreement known as MIRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These include a greater flexibility in the operation of the seafarers engagement system (the pooled labour scheme for ratings) and other measures which provide ship operators with the kind of cost savings and other benefits more generally associated with company employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Shipowners Association has estimated that, across the current major trading fleet (which includes both coastal and international trading ships), savings of some $15 million per year can be achieved under MIRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform measures introduced by MIRA will also deliver cost savings and efficiencies to the offshore industry supply fleet, which services Australia's offshore petroleum and gas industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The structure of the Government's reform package is based upon the recommendations of the August 1994 report by the then Chairman of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, Mr Rae Taylor AO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report recognised the achievement of the reform programs implemented by Government and the shipping industry since the early 1980s. These reforms had focused on reductions in crewing levels, a radical restructure of seafarer training and the introduction of modern, technologically advanced, fuel efficient ships into the Australian fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past decade Australian shipowners have invested some $1.6 billion in new tonnage; the average age of ships in the Australian fleet is 11 years, compared with 18 years in the world fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1983, a typical Australian trading ship had a crew of 33; today that figure is 18. While in 1983 the Australian average crew size was well in excess of OECD levels, our crew levels are now lower. These are remarkable achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over recent years there has been a trend by OECD national flag operators towards registering their vessels under open or international registers. These registers typically offer attractive taxation regimes and the ability to replace wholly national crews with lower-cost mixed nationality crews, predominantly from the developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taylor Report found that, as a result of this changed overseas situation, the competitive gap between Australian ships and comparable overseas ships operated under international registers was about $2 million per ship per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report, having examined the main areas of cost disabilities affecting Australian shipping, concluded the PAYE taxation regime had a major impact on Australia's competitive position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Report recommended removal of the PAYE taxation cost element from Australia's international trading ships in order to match the position of overseas ship operators, whose crews are either exempt from PAYE taxation or where the taxation impact on crew costs is offset by other concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepted the thrust of the Taylor Report findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After examining a range of options in the crew taxation area, the Government has decided that a grant based on the notional tax liabilities of seafarers serving on ships trading internationally would be the most effective and practicable means of achieving the objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill now before the Senate introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australian shipping industry employers, based on the notional PAYE taxation liabilities on the earnings of Australian-resident crew members on ships in Australia's international trading fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seafarers will, of course, have their PAYE tax deducted in the normal way and, like every other taxpayer, will be able to claim the rebates and deductions to which they are entitled in respect of their total earnings for the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I now turn to the details of the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2, which takes in clauses 3&mdash;7, explains the expressions and definitions used in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3 defines an eligible ship to mean an Australian-operated commercial trading ship with a deadweight tonnage of 2,000 tonnes or more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 defines Australian-operated ship to include ships on demise charter to Australian entities, as well as ships owned by Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 5 defines the meaning of international voyage. This is an important definition as time spent on international voyages is one of the key criteria for qualifying for the grant. Calls at intermediate Australian ports as part of an overall international voyage are permitted, provided any coastal cargo carried between Australian ports does not exceed the international cargo on board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In clause 7 are to be found the general definitions such as "seafarer", "Australian-resident seafarer" and "seafarer berth".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These again are important definitions as the grant is only payable in respect of bona fide, duly qualified, seafarers who are ordinarily resident in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I would mention at this point that the term "seafarer berth" is used throughout in the bill in the sense of a crew position or job on the ship; rather than to simply mean a cabin or bed. By adopting the concept of the seafarer berth and using the notional tax on the award wages or enterprise agreement wages, as applicable, for that berth, the computation of the grant amount is reduced to a relatively straightforward calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the bill which covers clauses 8&mdash;12, contains the elements for establishing the entitlement to the grant and calculating the grant amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 8 sets the basic parameters for entitlement to the grant. Essentially, the grant is payable to the employer of the crew of an eligible ship, which has spent the requisite number of days in international trades.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 9 sets out the method of calculating the amount of grant unit for each seafarer berth. Factored into the grant calculation is the number of days in the year that each berth is actually occupied by an Australian-resident seafarer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, Mr President, if any berths are occupied by non-residents or if any berths are unoccupied during a repair or lay-up period, or because the ship is sailing short-handed, then the grant units calculated for those berths will be reduced proportionately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grant amount is simply the sum of the grant units for the seafarer berths on the ship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 10 establishes the eligible employment period, which is the period in respect of which the grant is paid. This clause also determines that the grant is to be paid to the actual employer of the crew and that the employer must be an Australian entity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of ship operators in Australia appoint a management company to look after the day to day running of the ship, including crew related matters such as paying salaries and making the PAYE tax deductions. In such circumstances it would be the management company that is the actual employer, not the operator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the notional linkage between the grant and crew PAYE income tax, it follows that the employer of the crew is the appropriate recipient of the grant. Clearly if the employer and the ship operator are not the same entity, they will need to reach a commercial agreement on the allocation of the grant monies once paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the employer employs the crew on a ship for the whole year then the "eligible employment period" is the whole year. If the employer only employs the crew for a part year, then the "eligible employment period" would only apply to the part year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These eligible employment periods are not transferable. For example, if during the period covered by the first employer the ship is wholly engaged in international trading and during the period covered by the second employer the ship is mainly engaged in coastal trading, the international trading days accrued by the first employer could not be transferred to the second employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 11 sets out the formula for calculating the minimum number of days in international trading to qualify for the grant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, you will note that the formula excludes non-operational days of repair, maintenance or lay-up from the minimum days calculation. There will thus be no advantage for an operator to obtain repairs or lay-up the ship overseas simply in order to accumulate more international trading days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, once a ship has crossed the minimum days international trading threshold, then the grant is payable in respect of the berth occupancy over the full eligible employment period, which would include any days of repairs, maintenance or lay-up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grant will be paid annually in arrears after receipt of appropriate documentation from the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of grant is determined by clause 12 of the bill. The grant payable is the sum of the notional tax liabilities calculated on the award or enterprise agreement wages relating to the various seafarer berths on the ship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The method of determining eligibility and calculating the amount of grant is very straightforward and will not impose a significant administrative workload on the employer in substantiating a claim for a grant. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements will be administered by the Department of Transport, with the departmental Secretary being the nominated decision-maker in respect of applications for grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are appropriate safeguards in the bill to enable authorised persons appointed by the Secretary to make any necessary investigations to verify the substance of claim applications and prevent fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In common with other legislation involving administrative decisions, clause 22 of the bill provides for an Administrative Appeals Tribunal review, if there is dissatisfaction with a decision made in relation to a claim for grant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also facilitates Parliamentary scrutiny of the scheme. Clause 25 requires the Secretary to submit to the Minister of the day a return of the grants paid in the previous year, and for the Minister to table the returns before both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, through this bill, the crew taxation disadvantages for Australian operators will be eliminated. Furthermore, by providing the benefit direct to employers, the whole amount will be directed to narrowing the competitive gap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill, together with the industry reforms implemented through the Maritime Industry Restructuring Agreement, will promote a more competitive international fleet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be remembered that as recently as 25 years ago, Australian shipping had minimal involvement in international trades. Now there are some 30 ships regularly trading overseas. These ships are competing directly with overseas competition at prevailing international freight rates largely by exploiting market niches. This Government's previous shipping reform measures have played a major role in this achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grant to be implemented by this bill is an integral part of a new shipping reform package which raises the benchmark for Australian shipping and provides the wherewithal to take the industry into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It continues the cooperative reform process begun in the early 1980s and provides new initiatives to allow Australian shipping to improve its competitiveness in the international shipping market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its purpose is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to implement the recommendations of the ALRC Report No 2 on Criminal Investigation, submitted as long ago as 1975, and reaffirmed in greater detail, after a thorough examination of the issues, in the Fifth Interim Report of the Review of the Commonwealth Criminal Law in 1991. Even in 1975, the ALRC was of the view that `the probative value of this kind of evidence is such that it ought to be obtainable and admissible, provided that enforceable safeguards for the accused are built into the system'. Whatever else may be said about forensic evidence, nobody says that it should be ignored, and nobody says that it should be rejected as a tool of law enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law noted that there was no general Commonwealth law dealing with the medical or forensic examination of a person in lawful custody, and that the majority of State and Territory laws merely authorised a medical examination where reasonable grounds exist to believe that an examination of a person will afford evidence as to the commission of the crime or offence involved (cf s.353A(2) Crimes Act (NSW), s.236 of the Criminal Code (WA), and s.81 of the Summary Offences Act 1953 (SA)).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In such general provisions, doubt exists as to the extent of the power, even on the basic question of whether or not samples may be taken without consent. The recent Fernando case in NSW clearly demonstrates this. In that case, the two men charged with the murder of nurse Sandra Hoare, refused to supply blood samples and challenged the NSW legislation. The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal held that the legislation did not in fact authorise the taking of blood samples without consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following this decision, an amendment was quickly made to enable blood, hair or saliva samples to be taken in NSW without consent, although no additional safeguards were added at that time. Indeed, the fact that safeguards vary between jurisdictions is of concern. Some of the current legislation contains virtually no safeguards at all. Other acts have basic protections such as examination by a medical practitioner, limitation on the presence of persons of the opposite sex during the examination, and provision to the person of a copy of the report. Even the requirement for a court order is not consistently provided where there is lack of consent or where the use of force is required. For example, none is required in South Australia or Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for consistent, and if possible uniform, laws throughout Australia, especially those laws which profoundly affect the rights of Australian citizens in the criminal justice system, has been increasingly recognised during the life of this Government. We have seen the passage of the foundation provisions of the Model Criminal Code, which is a major step in modelling a co-operative scheme for removing basic inconsistencies in principles of criminal responsibility throughout Australia. The Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Act 1994 performed the same function in relation to arrest and search powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time has now come for the Commonwealth to grasp the nettle which has been enjoying largely uncontrolled growth for more than twenty years and apply the same principled and balanced regulation to the role of forensic science in the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. It is clearly wrong, when, as a nation, we are rightly proud of our record of freedom and justice in a world where, sadly, neither of those things can be taken for granted, that different rules may apply to different groups of Australians depending purely on where they live, some of those rules being uncertain or oppressive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee (which is the body working towards a uniform criminal Code to be adopted by all Australian jurisdictions) prepared a model Forensic Procedures Bill which was widely circulated for comment to about 600 groups and individuals, representing many interests&mdash;defence lawyers, investigators, prosecutors, judges, academics, law societies, bar councils, civil liberties groups, human rights organisations, women's groups, victims groups, legal aid organisations, government Departments and interested individuals. When the Commonwealth commenced its own consultation process, a revised bill was again circulated. Over 60 submissions were received, analysed and, as far as practicable, recommendations were incorporated into the bill. Few submissions advocated the complete abandonment of the exercise. Most were concerned with the striking of the correct balance between the civil liberties of the individual and the requirement for the police to have adequate investigative powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Model Criminal Code Officers Committees Bill and the Commonwealth Bill are modelled on the Victorian legislation, which, in turn implemented the recommendations of the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation. I would say that seldom has a proposal requiring a delicate balance of civil liberties and law enforcement concerns been subjected to such a degree of scrutiny prior to its introduction to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now describe the effect of the bill and the proposed government amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, I wish to clarify that nothing in this bill prevents the police requesting non-suspects to undergo forensic procedures, as sometimes occurs, in order to narrow the field of investigation. The proposed legislation applies only to suspects as defined in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike most of the current state legislation, but consistently with the Victorian provisions, the Commonwealth Bill makes a clear distinction between intimate and non-intimate forensic procedures. Intimate forensic procedures consist of the external examination of the genital or anal area, the buttocks, in the case of a female, the breasts, and the taking of an intimate sample (ie blood, saliva, a buccal swab, pubic hair, and samples taken by swabs, washing, scraping or suctioning or the taking of a cast or photograph or lifting by tape from previously described intimate areas). The proposed legislation does not authorise any internal examinations except of the mouth. All procedures must be carried out by persons appropriately qualified for the particular procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-intimate procedures relate to those parts of the body not defined as intimate, the taking of non-intimate samples from non-intimate parts of the body, including from a nail or under a nail, hair other than pubic hair, photographs and casts and, in some circumstances, finger prints, foot prints, toe prints and palm prints. However where a person is in lawful custody the applicable law for the taking of fingerprints, footprints and palmprints is found in Part I AA of the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to those safeguards providing appropriate protection of a person's privacy and dignity which are common to all forensic procedures (of which I will speak later) unless a suspect gives his or her informed consent after receiving all relevant information, including the right to refuse (all of which must be recorded) no intimate procedure may be performed except by order of a magistrate. However, if a person is in lawful custody, non-intimate procedures may be carried out by appropriately qualified persons as ordered by a constable. These orders are subject to the same conditions as apply when a magistrate makes an order, and can only be made if the non-intimate procedures can be conducted within the custodial time limits provided in Part IC of the Crimes Act. Special procedures providing support and safeguards apply to children, adults incapable of comprehending the proceedings or giving informed consent, and to Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a magistrate makes an order for the carrying out of a forensic procedure he or she must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities not only that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the person is a suspect and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">on the evidence before him or her, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed a relevant offence</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but also that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there are reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure might tend to confirm or disprove that the suspect committed a relevant offence; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also specifies that, in considering the justification of any order, the magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence relevant to the offence, against the public interest in upholding the physical integrity of the suspect. It enumerates a number of matters relevant to that balancing of interests, including any practicable alternative means of obtaining evidence and any reasons given by the suspect for refusing to consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A court order is required, not only for intimate procedures where the suspect does not consent, but also for non-intimate procedures where the non-consenting suspect has not been arrested, where a suspect is unable to give informed consent by reason of youth or mental incapacity, or where the Part IC custodial time limits have expired or will expire before the proposed procedure can be completed. The criteria to be taken into account are the same in each case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Normally suspects will be present and able to contest any application for such an order. However, urgent interim orders may be sought from a magistrate to carry out a forensic procedure which must be done without delay, for example where the sample to be taken is of a highly volatile or perishable nature. Such applications may be made by any electronic means but the suspect and his or her lawyer (or interview friend for those categories of persons warranting special support) must be given an opportunity to communicate with the magistrate. The magistrate may make appropriate orders, including arrangements for the final hearing of the application. The applicant must record full details of the application and send a copy to the magistrate. If that record does not accord with the magistrate's record in all material respects, the order is taken to have had no effect. Any sample obtained as a result of the interim application may not be analysed unless it is perishable. If it is analysed, the results may not be disclosed to any person unless a final order is obtained. If the final order is not granted, the sample must be destroyed and, if any analysis of the sample was done, all copies of the results must be given to the suspect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of performing forensic procedures without consent on suspects who may or may not have been arrested for the relevant offence has aroused strong feelings in many who provided submissions in the consultation process. It will no doubt concern many of my Parliamentary colleagues, and has been deliberated over by the government at length.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in the Government's view, it is justified for the following reasons;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria, which I just quoted in some detail, set a very high standard and the magistrate must be satisfied these are met before making an order for procedures to be performed without consent. There must be evidence before the magistrate providing reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed the offence. If the magistrate is satisfied on this ground, then he or she must also be satisfied that the procedure is likely to produce probative evidence and, even if it is, that the conduct of the procedure is otherwise justified. That means that the forensic procedure cannot be sought by the police merely as a fishing expedition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Commonwealth law, arrest is a step of last resort. As well as the common law criteria for arrest, other conditions apply. Unless a constable, or in the case of a warrant, a magistrate, believes on reasonable grounds that proceeding by summons would be ineffective to ensure the appearance of the person before the court, or to prevent further criminal acts, including the destruction or fabrication of evidence and harassment of witnesses, a lawful arrest cannot be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, apart from strictly legal justifications, I believe that it is quite reasonable, in the interests of effective law enforcement, to request, and if necessary require, suspects to undertake relatively simple procedures either to exonerate themselves or to provide evidence that could confirm their involvement in a relevant offence. For example a man who is a prime suspect in a rape case may decline to provide a sample of saliva or blood to enable a DNA match with semen found on the victim. There is little difference in principle between evidence obtained from conducting forensic procedures and evidence obtained by means of a search warrant. I simply do not see why, as in the Hyland Case in Tasmania, it should be thought justifiable for police to have to wait 10 years, and for the victim's family to suffer an unresolved situation for 10 years, because a suspect refuses to consent to a forensic procedure and the law has no power to require him to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides a comprehensive scheme for obtaining forensic samples from adults, children under the age of 18 years, and persons incapable of managing their own affairs. It sets out the powers and obligations of police when carrying out the procedures, and details the many safeguards to protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, children, and the incapable. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the right to an interpreter and the provision of full information about the relevant procedure and the suspect's rights in a language likely to be understood by the person;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the right to be present at an application for a coercive procedure to be authorised, to be represented, make representations and to cross-examine;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the right to have a medical practitioner chosen by the suspect, present during most procedures, a medical practitioner of the same sex, if practicable, limitation on the numbers of constables that may be present during the carrying out of a forensic procedure, and restriction of the presence of opposite sex constables to cases of necessity;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where reasonable force is permitted to obtain a sample from a non-consenting suspect, the bill expressly prohibits that being done in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner, and also provides that procedures must be conducted in accordance with proper professional standards. Additionally, the bill makes it clear that nothing in the Part requires a medical practitioner or dentist to carry out a forensic procedure, even though an order may have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A maximum limit of 4 hours on the reasonable time for which a suspect can be detained for the conduct of a procedure is a further safeguard. As in Part 1C, certain time is excluded in calculating the expiry of the four hour limit. Such time includes waiting for the suspect's interview friend, lawyer or doctor to arrive or allowing the suspect to communicate with a friend, relative, lawyer or interpreter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as providing time limits on time for which a suspect can be held for the conduct of the procedure, the new Part repeats those safeguards provided to arrested persons under Part 1C which are applicable to the conduct of forensic procedures. These include the right of certain suspects to interview friends, the right of all suspects to contact a lawyer and to communicate with that lawyer in private whenever possible, the right to an interpreter where necessary, and tape recording of requests for consent and the conduct of procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in my view, a most potent safeguard in the present bill is provided by the legislative barrier to admissibility of evidence which is obtained from forensic procedures which are carried out in breach of the legislation. If there is any breach, the prosecution must justify to the court that there are </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">good reasons why the statutory scheme was not followed. In such a case the probative value of the evidence will not, by itself, justify its admission. The bill indicates a number of matters which the court must take into account in considering whether to admit such evidence, including the gravity of the contravention and whether it was intentional or reckless. Evidence is also inadmissible by the prosecution, with no discretion on the part of the court, where material was not destroyed in the circumstances required by the legislation. There are comprehensive requirements for the destruction of forensic material and inadmissibility of evidence derived from it, where proceedings have not been commenced within a certain period or where they have been finally determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should like to mention three further points which have caused some concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is the provision which permits the fact of a person's refusal to comply with any reasonable direction for the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a person, given by an authorised person, to be admissible in any proceedings against the person in a court, provided he or she has first been warned of that possibility. That is, admissibility is not limited to proceedings for non-compliance with a court order, or obstructing an officer in the course of his or her duty, but is admissible in the proceedings for the offence for which the forensic procedure was required. Accordingly, it is open to the jury to draw an inference from the person's refusal to permit the taking of the sample, which could involve the conclusion that the person had reason to fear the result of the procedure. One could, no doubt, imagine innocent reasons for resisting certain procedures, and these could be cogently put to the jury by the defence, with supporting evidence. However, I believe that where serious offences carrying heavy penalties are involved, without some serious consequence rendering non-compliance of doubtful value, a mere non-compliance offence with the usual low penalty would be an ineffective deterrent It could defeat the value of the coercive provisions in the legislation&mdash;the penalty a price willingly paid by a guilty suspect to avoid the availability of damning evidence of the more serious offence and there would be little point in proceeding with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second matter is the retention and use of forensic material. There are two aspects to this. The bill provides for a database to be set up and maintained for statistical purposes. That database must be designed in such a way that the information contained in it cannot be used to identify any individual on whom a forensic procedure was carried out. Such a database will be used for a purely scientific purpose to develop norms against which the degree of probability that any particular forensic material came from a particular person can be assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second aspect is the requirement that information about a person obtained from a forensic sample taken under the bill may not be recorded or retained in a personal records system if that sample is required by the bill to be destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, nothing in this bill affects the taking, retention, or use of a forensic sample, or of information from that sample, where that is authorised by another law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. It is not intended to repeal any other Commonwealth provisions that might exist&mdash;although these can if necessary be revised in due course. Nor is it intended to create any inconsistency with existing State/Territory provisions. It is expected that these will be revised as State/Territory legislation is developed to build up a national uniform scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I will briefly address criticisms that forensic evidence in recent years has fallen into disrepute, that it is not infallible, and that juries, blinded with science, may give disproportionate weight to evidence of dubious validity. However, as I noted previously, no-one suggests that its use should be abandoned and almost everyone acknowledges its value when properly used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All I wish to say on that issue, is that the present bill is concerned only with the procedural aspects of collecting and using forensic material. The procedures which are currently available are subject to varying, often minimal, safeguards. This bill aims to balance the need of law enforcement to have access to an investigative resource, which is constantly being developed and refined, against the right of the individual to live free of arbitrary intrusion by the state and free of arbitrary interference with his or her physical integrity and dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The products of the procedures provided by the bill, like the products of any other investigative technique, are weighed and evaluated as they pass through each of the filters provided by our criminal justice system: first by the investigators themselves, then by the prosecutors and their experts, then by the defence and its experts, and finally by the jury. Like all other evidence, it is subjected to the rigours of the adversary procedure. Experts are examined and cross-examined, the judge directs the jury on the applicable law and the standard of proof which must be satisfied, and the jury considers its verdict, taking into account all other evidence admitted as relevant in the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the view that this bill is bad and should be rejected because forensic evidence is less than 100 per cent reliable were applied to all evidence, the criminal courts would be cleared and no-one would ever be convicted. The standard of proof that is applied by the jury in a criminal trial is `beyond reasonable doubt'. That is a high test. In my opinion we must do the best we can with the means currently available to us. We must neither sacrifice civil liberties for expediency, nor reject available investigative techniques because they fall short of the standard of perfection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only financial implications arising from the bill involve minor costs associated with training which will be absorbed in the normal budgets of relevant agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other aspects of the bill are described in the explanatory memorandum which I now present.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 puts in place the necessary legislative framework for the sale of the Commonwealth Government's remaining 50.4 per cent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), as announced in the 1995-96 Budget on 9 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's decision to sell its remaining Commonwealth Bank shareholding reflects the significant changes which have occurred in the Australian financial system since the early 1980's and the changes which have occurred in the Commonwealth Bank since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deregulation of the financial system and the increased competition within the Australian banking sector in particular, has significantly weakened the case for majority Government ownership of a commercial bank. The Australian banking sector today is significantly more competitive, efficient and responsive to the needs of consumers and the Australian economy in general than was the case when this Government came to office in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no compelling reason why the Government should continue to hold a majority shareholding of a commercial bank in this environment. This view is shared by various State Governments which have recently privatised or announced plans for the privatisation of State Banks. For example, the State Bank of New South Wales was sold to Colonial Mutual in late 1994, the Bank of South Australia was sold to the Advance Bank on 1 August 1995 and the Western Australian Government recently announced its intention to sell a controlling interest in BankWest to the Bank of Scotland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Bank has undergone significant change since 1990. It is now a public company operating under the Corporations Law with a substantial private sector shareholding. This follows the two public share offers in 1991 and 1993, which resulted in around 49.6 per cent of the Bank's shares being held by both retail and institutional investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite being the majority shareholder, it has been the Commonwealth's long standing policy not to interfere in the commercial operations of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of the Commonwealth's 50.4 per cent Commonwealth Bank shareholding will provide a number of important benefits. The sale will contribute to the Commonwealth achieving a budget surplus in 1995-96, significantly reducing the need to raise public debt, to the benefit of all Australians and will place the Commonwealth Bank on a similar commercial and legal footing to that of its competitors. The sale will also provide an excellent opportunity for existing or prospective small shareholders to acquire shares in the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I now turn to the details of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Bank Sale Bill 1995 provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the necessary amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to facilitate the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">detailed transitional arrangements for the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation (CBOSC) and an on-going Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Development Bank (CDB);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the conversion of the CDB and the CBOSC from statutory authorities to Corporations Law companies and for the conversion of the statutory superannuation fund of the CBOSC to a trust;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Commonwealth Bank body, which includes the CBA and its subsidiaries, will be, as far as practicable, subject to legislation after the sale consistent with other private sector companies and approved banks;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Commonwealth Bank body and its shareholders are not disadvantaged under section 63A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as a result of the change in ownership resulting from the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shares;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the CBA and the CDB will be provided with appropriate transitional arrangements regarding protected business names;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the retention, post sale, of employee entitlements accrued in pre sale service under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the necessary consequential amendments to other Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Commonwealth Guarantee Arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides appropriate transitional measures for the Commonwealth guarantee applying to the CBA's liabilities consistent with the Treasurer's Budget night announcement. These arrangements ensure that the CBA's depositors, creditors and superannuation fund members are treated fairly as a result of the Commonwealth's sale of its shares. The arrangements are broadly comparable with those applying to the sale of the State Bank of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional arrangements relating to the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank and the CBOSC commence at the `Effective Date', which is defined as the time at which the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding falls to below 50 per cent, or 9 May 1996, whichever is the later. The transitional period for which the guarantee applies depends upon whether the liability is a demand deposit, a term deposit or any other liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional arrangements provide for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the guarantee of all demand deposits for a period of three years from the Effective Date;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the guarantee, until maturity, of term deposits outstanding at the Effective Date or made during the three years following the Effective Date; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the guarantee, until maturity, of all other liabilities and off-balance sheet obligations outstanding at the Effective Date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that the Commonwealth will continue to guarantee all of the liabilities of the CDB as is currently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that the Commonwealth will guarantee the liabilities of the CBOSC (or the superannuation fund) for a person who was a member, retired member or beneficiary before the commencement of the relevant provisions of the act. This section preserves for these persons the guarantee currently contained in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank are to negotiate appropriate accountability arrangements relating to the Commonwealth guarantee of the liabilities of the CBA, CBOSC and the CDB. These arrangements, which will be negotiated before the Commonwealth sells any of its shares, will be of a contractual nature and will be binding on the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxation Issues</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides an exemption from the possible application of section 63A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to the deductibility of losses on bad debts. This provision seeks to ensure that the Commonwealth Bank body and its shareholders are not disadvantaged as a result of the change in ownership resulting from the sale of the Commonwealth's shares. This is irrespective of whether the sale is structured in such a way that an intermediary or intermediaries are interposed between the Commonwealth as seller and the buyers of the Commonwealth's shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also exempts various transactions associated with the sale of the Commonwealth's CBA shares from most State and Territory taxes, levies, fees, duties and charges. This measure is intended to enhance the attractiveness of the sale to potential purchasers. The Commonwealth, however, has indicated its in-principle support for providing relevant States and Territories with an ex-gratia payment compensating them for stamp duty forgone in relation to the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign Ownership</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill does not impose any legislative restrictions on the ability of foreign interests to acquire shares in the Commonwealth Bank. Post sale, the CBA will be subject to the same foreign investment regulatory framework that applies to other Australian banks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International investors will be permitted to participate in the public sale of CBA shares as was the case in the 1993 sale. Foreign participation will expand the market for the CBA's shares which is in the interests of all shareholders. It would be pointless to deny such participation when foreign investors can buy CBA shares on the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Commonwealth Bank will remain predominantly Australian owned immediately after the sale and will have a dispersed share ownership given the application of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 and the allocation policy which is expected to apply for foreign investor participation in the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future of the Commonwealth Development Bank</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed sale arrangements not only provide for the retention of the Commonwealth Development Bank with its existing Charter and the Commonwealth Guarantee of its liabilities, but will also enhance the CDB as an independent financial institution aimed at providing specialist banking services to the small business and rural sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CDB will continue to be 91.9 per cent owned by the Commonwealth Bank and 8.1 per cent owned by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will continue to pay an annual subsidy to the CDB to undertake the banking activities defined in its Charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the conversion of the CDB from a statutory authority to a public company under the Corporations Law with its own Memorandum and Articles of Association. The CDB's existing Charter will be removed from the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 and replicated in the CDB's Memorandum of Association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conversion of the CDB to a public company with its own Board of Directors will enhance its position as a specialist financial institution. This is consistent with the proposed granting of a separate banking authority to the CDB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The retention of the existing Commonwealth guarantee arrangements for the CDB will ensure that the CDB can obtain necessary financing on a competitive basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to the Commonwealth's CBA shareholding falling to below 50 per cent, a shareholders' agreement will be entered into between the Commonwealth and the CBA on various matters relating to the CDB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This agreement will detail the annual subsidy determination and review arrangements and will contain an undertaking from the CBA that it will not exercise its voting power to amend the CDB's Memorandum and Articles of Association while an adequate Commonwealth subsidy is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The shareholders' agreement will be made available when it is finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Protected Business Names</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will provide the CBA and the CDB with a 10 year transitional arrangement regarding various protected business names. At the end of the 10 year period, the CBA and the CDB will no longer have any specific legislative protection of their business names. This provision is intended to provide the CBA and the CDB with sufficient opportunity to develop appropriate commercial strategies to utilise the value of their protected names. This will be to the benefit of both existing and future CBA shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion Mr Speaker, the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining CBA shareholding will provide a number of significant benefits to the Commonwealth and the Australian people as well as existing and prospective CBA shareholders. The proposed sale arrangements will ensure that the Bank's depositors, creditors and superannuation fund members are not disadvantaged by the sale. The arrangements will also ensure that the specialist banking functions of the CDB are retained to the benefit of the small business and rural communities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Telecommunications (Service Providers Class Licence) Direction No. 1 of 1995, made under subsection 204(1) of the Telecommunications Act 1991, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's intention for the Telecommunications (Service Providers Class Licence) Direction No. 1 of 1995 is that it will promote competition, diversity of content, technical innovation and new investment in broadband services delivered by cable. I am moving this motion of disallowance because it is the Australian Democrats' firm belief that the direction will achieve none of these aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direction will not promote competition. Instead, it leaves crucial decisions about competing pay operators' rights of access in the hands of the cable owner duopoly. The direction will not promote diversity of content. What new content industry producers will have the confidence to invest, if access to the main delivery systems is at the whim of the cable owners. The direction cannot promote technical innovation if new services cannot gain access to the level of infrastructure they need at prices which are both stable and reasonable. The direction will not promote new investment in broadband services if those services cannot be assured of the access they need to the paying public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the direction is simply the government's compromise response to the very clever legal device Optus used to ensure that, when it built its broadband network, Telstra could not demand access to that network. Optus determined that it, as carrier, would install and maintain the broadband network, but the network would be owned by Optus Vision and, because Optus Vision would not be a carrier, it would not be covered by the rules requiring carriers to give other carriers access to their networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel's report on the Optus Vision structure, issued in November 1994, found the structure was legal under the Telecommunications Act. But, in Austel's view, the structure's avoidance of carrier obligations did not fit comfortably within the pro-competitive spirit of the act or the government's policy intentions. Austel's report recommended that Optus Vision should follow the same rules as carriers. Optus Vision should permit carriers and competing service providers to connect to its network on the same basis as required for carrier networks, and Optus Vision should be subject to the same pricing principles and carrier arbitration procedures as the carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response&mdash;this direction&mdash;falls short of those recommendations. Instead, the direction created a new creature, a carrier associate. Carrier associates have fewer obligations on them than the carriers whose networks they own and control. They are free of the pricing rules covering carriers; they are free of the obligations to provide access to other pay TV operators, which are very widely defined in the direction; and they are free from the threat of an Austel direction to provide defined levels of access to their networks. Not surprisingly, Telstra's response was to immediately create its own carrier associate and gain similar exemptions from carrier responsibility for its broadband network or, rather, the network it is building and then handing to its carrier associate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for the direction does make some sense, but not altogether. The amount of capital required for building broadband networks is in the billions of dollars. Carriers need at least some initial period to protect what will be small, but hopefully growing, revenue streams from the networks, and requiring carriers to give open access to a rival would clearly threaten that revenue source. It would be like insisting that every time a developer builds a new shopping centre, he or she must give rival developers access to the new shops. And with the rival's access to new shops goes the loss of profits and the rents necessary for our developer to build the shops in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the networks being built are not like shopping centres. They are being built using the carrier's powers and immunities from compliance with local planning rules and state and territory laws for the protection of national heritage sites and for the protection of the environment. Our hypothetical developer must comply with all relevant rules and regulations to build that new shopping centre&mdash;carriers do not. The increasing public outcry against new telecommunications towers and facilities means that these new networks are being built at a great cost to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second and much more important difference between our hypothetical shopping centre and the broadband networks. One shopping centre more or less makes almost no difference to national goals, but the broadband networks will be Australia's information highways to the future and central to Australia's entry into the information age. The broadband highways have the potential to bring new education and health services to areas starved of those services. They can provide avenues for new creative Australian talent. They will be a major factor in Australia's international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As both the Broadband Service Export Group and the government's Creative Nation statement stressed, the information highways are essential for the development of new multimedia content. Clearly, access to those highways is the key for Australian success. Yet the direction governing access to those highways falls short of those national goals. It recognises the legal device of carrier associate and, with that, the evasion by carriers of their full responsibilities for access under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do recognise the commercial reality of large investment decisions being made by both carrier associates based on the set of rules provided by the direction, and we are not seeking to jeopardise the very large sums being spent on broadband networks. What we are seeking through this motion is for the government to change the direction's rules to strike a better balance between the need for commercial certainty and the need for access to Australia's new information highways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the Democrats have three major concerns about the direction, and we hope they can be addressed. Our first criticism of the direction is its definition of `pay TV service'. The significance of the definition is that carrier associates must provide access to their networks, except to other pay TV services. Therefore, the wider the definition of `pay TV service', the wider the exemption from that access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the direction, `pay TV service' includes not only subscription television broadcasting services but also subscription narrowcasting services and services which provide movies on demand. Our concern is that there are many services, including community and local services, or very specialised, niche narrowcasting services, which are of no commercial threat to carrier associates, yet which could be refused access to carrier associates' networks under the current `pay TV service' definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that both Optus Vision and Telstra Multimedia are developing proposals under which new community and independent content providers can gain access to their broadband networks. To the extent that results in access to more diverse independent programming, we welcome those proposals. Our second concern is the lack of an unbundling requirement to carrier associate networks. Austel can now require carriers to supply specific levels of functionality or transmission capacity to service providers after an inquiry into the feasibility and the impact of making such a direction. Carrier associates are not subject to the same unbundling provisions, even though the networks in question are built by carriers under carrier powers and immunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are very limited remedies for people seeking access to broadband capacity but refused by carrier associates. Austel has a very general power to promote competition in the telecommunications industry but it does not have specific powers to arbitrate over access disputes or direct that access be provided to carrier associates' networks on fair and reasonable terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One solution we strongly urge to the government would be to mandate that each carrier associate set aside a percentage of channel capacity for open access. The danger in not doing so is that, otherwise, carrier associates can insist that all their channel capacity be taken and, therefore, claim they cannot provide access for independent content or service providers. There is no appeal mechanism which could test that claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, by setting a percentage of capacity for open access, the government can ensure that as broadband network capacity is increased, capacity available for open access is also increased. Open access cannot be seen as a threat to carrier associates. If the press is to be believed, the carrier associates, Optus Vision and Telstra Multimedia, are nowhere near filling the 60 plus channels available on the coaxial cable which they are now installing. Indeed, the fact that Foxtel was willing to go to court to confirm its ability to carry all five free to air television channels must indicate that there is spare capacity somewhere on their network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What mandated open access may well do is encourage new, independent content and encourage service providers to develop their products and their services. Surely, more independent providers seeking more access can only result in more money in the carrier associates' coffers. We are disappointed that the coalition has already telegraphed that it is not going to support this motion. Their press release calls our motion `well-intentioned but misguided'. While I agree with the first part of the description, I have to disagree with the second. This motion is not misguided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that if the direction were disallowed, there would be no rules governing carrier associates' behaviour, rather than the flawed ones now operating. What disallowance would do is force the government to develop new and better rules, something which Senator Alston has tried to do in the past&mdash;I might add&mdash;and which would strike a better balance between the very understandable and genuine need for carrier associates to have regulatory certainty when making massive investments and the equally important policy objective of having more open access to ensure more diversity of service and content providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important objective in moving this motion is to signal now that the Democrats believe this carrier associate regime should end when the direction says it will, in 1997. We note the government's statement in both the telecommunications policy principle post-1997 and the explanatory memorandum that the direction might be continued until 1999 if there is `appropriate competition' in pay television delivery using cable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the proposed Australis-Foxtel merger and the more precarious position of Optus Vision as a result of the merger, it is extremely difficult to even contemplate there being anything like the kind of competition in cable which could justify an extension of this direction. In this we do agree with the coalition's call for an immediate government commitment that the direction will end in 1997 with the beginning of a more competitive telecommunications regime. The government has promised very significant changes in the post-1997 telecommunications regime. Carriers will be differently defined and, if the principles are reflected in the legislation, they will include what are now defined as carrier associates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The access regime outlined in principles will also be stronger and will require carriers, which would include carriers associates, to give mandatory undertakings about interconnection and access rules. There will be an arbiter, the ACCC, with the powers to scrutinise and enforce those undertakings. There should be no need for this direction in the post-97 environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be carefully scrutinising draft telecommunications legislation for the post-97 environment to ensure that the principles adopted by cabinet are translated into a more open access regime which provides a fair return for the large investment needed but which also provides for fairer, more open access rules to encourage the sort of service and the content diversity which will benefit all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important motion. The Australian Democrats, and Senator Bourne in particular, have given it a lot of careful attention. They have addressed many of the issues that have concerned us. I suppose where we disagree is the outcome if the current regime were to suddenly lapse. I do not for a moment think that the government would do anything about it, simply because in the run-up to an election it would suit their purposes to suggest that there was chaos by allowing a black hole to develop. That, in a sense, is a part of the procedural difficulty we have. It is all or nothing. You cannot amend the motion or the direction. You either allow it in whole or disallow it in whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken the view that we have got this far down the track. Both carriers have been led on, in a sense, by the government to a point where it would be very destabilising to suddenly pull the plug half way through. That is in large part a fault of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) for taking such an inordinate length of time to make a decision. His original announcement was in November last year. He proposed a regime which was unique, in my understanding, in the world. Australia alone, of all countries, would have a duopoly regime which would allow a duplicate roll out. There was a potential for an overbuild of $3 million to $4 million. That would extend to 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the classic words, which no doubt were drafted by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), if there was appropriate competition they would extend that regime until 1999. If ever there was a licence for special deals, backroom discussions and grace and favour decision making, surely this has to be it. It is a classic example of the way this government operates. There is no transparency. There are no principles that people can understand. There is no coherence in the regime they put in place. It is all discretionary. `If you do us a favour, we will do you a favour. We reserve the right to decide whether or not we want to help the carriers at a later point in time.' That is an outrageous basis on which to approach this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had a number of choices before it back in November last. I am sure the Senate recalls those extraordinary words of the Prime Minister about the Optus Vision proposal being the greatest scam since Murray Farquhar. In typical fashion, the Prime Minister totally distorted that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know there have been exclusive regional franchise areas in places like the US, the UK and Canada. They have generally proceeded on the basis that in a defined geographic area only one carrier has the right to roll out the cable. A fundamental requirement, which as I understand was implicit in the Optus Vision proposal, was that they do it on a common carrier basis. Others would be automatically entitled to access that cable. You would not have duplication. You would have one carrier owning the cable, and other operators having an entitlement to access it. That was one formula that could have been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another model, which is certainly not unusual, is to maintain the distinction between carriage and content and to require that there be a utility that owns all the cable and then all those wanting to operate pay television services would interconnect to that system. It would be at arms length. You would not find one carrier beholden to the other. That was certainly an option that was available at that time. Instead, what the Minister came up with was this hybrid and very unsatisfactory compromise that involves 2 1/2 years or possibly 4 1/2 years of duopoly protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I think it is quite clear that they have sought to muddy the waters by including the pay television exemption in the carrier associates direction. The whole concept of carrier associates is a device in many respects to avoid the consequences that would flow from the carriers otherwise being required to provide common carrier facilities which would automatically entitle others to access them. Given that that device is in place, it is simply extraordinary that it took the minister from 24 November last year to 22 August this year to table this direction. Our problem is that, with the best will in the world, the Democrats' proposal does not take account of what water has flowed under the bridge since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Optus in particular, which is challenging the incumbent and therefore is taking most of the risks in this business&mdash;and, after all, Telstra is effectively using taxpayers' funds to fund its roll out&mdash;is using private sector funding and has gone a substantial way down the track. To use the blunt instrument of disallowance to effectively change the rules of the game halfway through would introduce a great deal of uncertainty into the environment in which the carriers would be operating. That is why we have made it clear that we are not prepared to simply disallow the entire direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of aspects of that direction that continue to concern us. It is quite clear that the government has given no indication of its intention to extend the pro-competitive open access requirements for telecommunications, which will apply beyond 1997 to broadband interactive services. There is no reason in principle why you should not have the same regimes. There is certainly nothing in the carrier associates direction which would justify that differential treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we find in the carrier associates direction is a range of qualifications that make it much more difficult for service providers and others to get access to a carrier's cables for broadband interactive services, even to the point where a carrier is allowed to refuse access because it might interfere with their future capacity. That is a tailor-made invitation for carriers to simply argue that at all times there is no surplus. Anyone who is familiar with the bandwidth that can be eaten up with virtual video on demand will understand that it is not a very difficult matter to simply have four or five channels dedicated on a permanent basis to the showing of one particular movie at 15-minute start-up intervals. It is not a very difficult matter to effectively squeeze out your competitors and to argue that there is no surplus capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment is very much designed to flush the government out. I look forward to Senator McMullan elaborating on what the government's principles are, what would determine the desirability of extending the duopoly, what is meant by appropriate competition, and indeed whether the government has given any thought to that proposition at all other than simply reserving the right to make grace and favour decisions down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think that is a totally unsatisfactory basis for decision making, but it is almost second nature to this government and part and parcel of the fatigue that has overtaken it in recent years. It is no longer interested in sensible, transparent regimes. It is not interested in giving all those who want to get into the industry a degree of certainty so that they can plan accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very unsatisfactory, for example, that the government simply refuses to address Austel's report on service provider access to the current carriers basic network. Austel tabled its report back in March this year. There has been absolutely no government response to that. There is going to be no mandated interconnect regime, so once again those wanting to compete are left to effectively beg Telstra for access at reasonable rates. There is nothing to stop Telstra saying no. Austel's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austel's assessment of the performance of the service provider industry indicates that it is not as yet performing in a way which would be expected from an efficient industry displaying the characteristics of commercially sustainable competition. Austel believes that under the current market conditions and carrier strategies it is highly unlikely that the government's objectives relating to effective competition, increased consumer choice and greater technological and service innovation in the service provider industry are likely to be achieved to a substantive degree.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on to say later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little genuine price or non-price competition occurring in the service provider industry. Many customers do not believe that they are receiving the price and other benefits potentially available in an effective competitive market. Currently, profitability across the voice resale segment of the service provider industry is generally low. A major factor which is adversely influenced by the profitability and return on investment achieved within the industry is the range of strategic barriers to entry resulting from actions of one or both of the carriers.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this is yet again another duopoly arrangement which effectively ensures that there cannot be a competitive market. We find it extraordinary that, whilst the government is at least promising to introduce a pro competitive, open access regime for telecommunications&mdash;and I must say I still reserve our position until we see the fine print that will translate those 99 principles into legislative form&mdash;the fact remains that at least it is on the record as espousing the principle of competition in the area of telecommunications after 1997. But the government is not prepared to do that in relation to broadband interactive services. That is simply another example of why this industry is fundamentally unhappy with the government's patronage system, which is now endemic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be interested to see what the government has to say, given that it will obviously oppose the disallowance motion, as to whether it is in fact prepared to support our call for an immediate commitment that it will introduce an open access regime for cable pay television from July 1997. Indeed, I do not think there is any good reason why the Democrats could not support that proposition as well. Given that they have a fair idea of the lie of the land and the ultimate outcome, it may well be that at least we have achieved something in this chamber if that motion is passed. Irrespective of the result today, I do not think there is any doubt that we both&mdash;that is, the Democrats and us&mdash;share the view that it is simply an untenable proposition to argue on some unarticulated basis that you ought to be able to extend duopoly arrangements through until 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter that also gives me concern, and I will listen with great interest to see whether the minister is prepared to respond. If he does not, we will all draw the appropriate conclusions. In an article by Fred Brenchley on Monday this week he talked about the deal that had been originally struck by News with Telstra which gives Foxtel a 25-year exclusivity for pay TV on Telstra's cable system. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, some analysts believe that the merger fine print even extends this deal.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not privy to that deal. I would have thought that the government, as the ultimate shareholder in Telstra, would have every capacity to scrutinise that deal. Given that Mr Lee was boasting on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> only a matter of four or five weeks ago that he has very close and continuing relations with the Telstra board, I would have thought they would have been duty bound to bring the matter before him and to get the government's approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the government turned a blind eye to things like the formation of the Packer-Murdoch-Telstra consortium and Telstra's purchase of 10 per cent of Channel 7 for $60 million. They were very major threshold decisions in terms of blurring the distinction between carriage and content. But the formation of the Foxtel joint venture is another thing again. I would be absolutely astounded if the government was not acutely or intimately involved in the negotiations that led to that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is clearly in a position to throw light on whether Fred Brenchley has it right. I cannot believe that he has. It is possible that there might be a non-compete clause that would say that if either News or Telstra wished to get into the pay television business they had to do it through the medium of the joint venture. In other words, they could not separately compete with themselves as partners in the joint venture. If that were all that was involved in the 25-year restrictive covenant exclusivity clause, it would still allow third parties to have automatic entitlement to access to the cable networks. If Mr Brenchley is right, he is saying that third parties are locked out for 25 years or more. That would make a mockery of even the possibility of extending to 1999. So I hope that the government will clarify the position on that critical issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by saying that we have a number of very real and ongoing concerns about the implications for competition as contained in the carrier direction. Given the lapse of time and the fact that it is a blunt instrument&mdash;it is all or nothing in terms of allowance or disallowance&mdash;we are not prepared to support the Democrats' principal motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do have an amendment which offers a very real opportunity for all parties in this chamber to at least show that it is the view of the parliament that, from 1997, competition ought to be introduced. If that is not the government position&mdash;I suspect that it will not be&mdash;there will be a very clear difference between the major parties in the run-up to the next election. We will be on the record as being pro-competitive. They will be on the record as once again wanting to do the same old patronage deals to decide when they think it is appropriate, depending on who knocks loudest on their door or who rents them hardest and longest. That is not the basis on which we think decisions ought to be made in an industry that has enormous competitive consequences and opportunities for Australia. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Omit all words after "That", substitute: "the Senate calls on the Government to immediately give a commitment that it will introduce an open access regime for cable pay television from July 1997".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate could become obsessive in its technicality. It is appropriate that Senator Bourne and Senator Alston, who have been dealing with this in great detail with the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), have not gone into an excess of technicality and eye-glazing detail that becomes possible in some of these debates. We have tried to move generally to the principles with which we are dealing. Some of the issues ranged well beyond the issues that we are dealing with in this disallowance motion. I accept that there is not an infinite number of forums. People took this opportunity to raise some issues. If the minister wishes to respond to those that do not relate particularly to this debate, that is a matter for him. The debate will go on in public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to confine my remarks mainly to the central issue of the disallowance and then briefly to Senator Alston's amendment. Nobody would be surprised to know that we are not supporting either motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, the background is known to all the participants in the debate. It is necessary to put all the various elements of the government's action in context. On 24 November 1994, Mr Lee announced that the government would act to ensure that the access provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1991 would, with a limited exemption for pay television, apply to broadband cable being installed by the carriers. The catalyst for this was proposals by Optus and Telstra and their partners to construct cable networks to deliver a range of telephone broadband and pay TV services. The announcement also followed a report by Austel on the Optus and Telstra proposals. Direction No. 1 of 1995 gives effect to that policy. That is the sequence of background events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening? Austel is currently implementing the direction, as set down, by preparing class licences that will enable access by service providers to the broadband cable. It is important to remember that, without the direction, cable that was installed by carriers but owned by a related company&mdash;under the mechanism, for example, that Senator Bourne referred to&mdash;would not be subject to the access provisions of the Telecommunications Act. Under the act, access provisions apply to cable owned by carriers but not by a related company. Let us look at what it all means for policy. At the end of the day, it is about what the policy principles are and what themes we wish to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy direction provides for access to these broadband networks for the purpose of supplying telephone and broadband services. In some ways, the focus of attention always flows back to pay TV, but we should not underestimate the significance of that to ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This open access framework should promote competition in telephony, technical innovation and competition, diversity and development of Australian content in the provision of the interactive broadband services of the future. The direction does provide a limited exemption from this access framework where access is required to provide pay television services. The exemption is often what draws the attention. That is not unusual; it is not exclusive to this area of policy&mdash;it is where attention tends to focus. But we cannot afford to focus only on that and ignore the implications for other elements of the policy that underpin and the action that flows from the direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption will apply, as everybody knows, until 30 June 1997, with a possible extension or a maximum period to 30 June 1999 if there is appropriate competition in the delivery of pay television services using cable. This limited exemption needs to be put into full context. It is only for a limited period and it does give carriers an incentive to roll out their networks rapidly. It also gives a clear indication to industry of when full access to broadband cable infrastructure will be available to all service providers, and a strong signal to the consortia that there must be appropriate competition. It is an exemption that recognises the commercial reality. The need for carriers to have incentives to justify the expenditure is currently estimated to be in the order of $7 billion involved in installing the cable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new infrastructure will encourage competition not only in pay television services but also in local calls and a range of broadband interactive services in the years to come. It provides that incentive to cable builders by allowing the owners of the cable to earn revenue from the provision of pay television content rather than revenue from just selling the carriage component of those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to remember once again for the record&mdash;because I know Senator Bourne and Senator Alston know this, but we need to make it clear and more comprehensive&mdash;that the existing Trade Practices Act will apply to carrier associate behaviour. That act has well-established provisions to deal with abuse of market power and anti-competitive conduct. We all know that the Trade Practices Commission, as currently constituted, has been prepared to speak up strongly about these issues when they have arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The access framework being established by the direction will also provide an appropriate transition to the open access telecommunications arrangement post-1997. Provision will be made to continue the general exemption for pay television services from the full force of the post-1997 access policy until 30 June 1999, but it will only be granted if appropriate competition exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As foreshadowed in the minister's 24 November statement, the government has encouraged both Optus Vision and Telstra Multimedia Pty Ltd and Foxtel to make available some capacity on their networks for community access and education. The government has been advised by both consortia that they are currently developing initiatives to provide services for community and educational purposes. So it is important that we have those elements in the equation that is flowing and which we do not wish to see disrupted by the uncertainty that would flow, inevitably, from this disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An uncertain regulatory environment which would inevitably follow from disallowing this direction could well discourage investment. It is important that we minimise uncertainty in the industry, given the significance of the telecommunications industry in general in Australian life and the significance of the proposed investments in cable in particular. The direction seems to the government to strike the right balance between encouraging cable roll-out and ensuring open access to the cable infrastructure for all service providers in the medium term. I should have thought we all agree that we want to achieve both those goals&mdash;but what is the balance that we want to strike between them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy was first announced in November. There has been some issue about whether it has perhaps taken undue time to finalise the direction first foreshadowed in November 1994, but it was a direction that involved complex policy and legal issues. We are dealing with new types of infrastructure and services. There has been extensive public consultation since November 1994 in preparing the direction. I would have thought the Senate would have felt that should be the case; they would have supported that. There have been two full rounds of public consultation since November, two drafts of the direction being circulated to industry, consumer and government groups or their representatives. We appreciate the fact that many people provided comments during the preparation of the direction and put a lot of effort into that. It was greatly appreciated by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the general question, what we do not want to see, and this is, with regard to this matter, consistent in this small part with Senator Alston's view&mdash;I did not agree with some of the other parts&mdash;is if as a consequence of a last minute objection to the policy reflected in the disallowance here that were to place in jeopardy continuing investments in the cable as well as to deny access to cable for telephone and broadband service providers. I do not think we can sensibly proceed in that manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn in a moment to Senator Alston's amendment, but I want to make a brief response to one other point that Senator Bourne made earlier about disputes between carrier associates and service providers. My understanding is that any dispute between a carrier associate and a service provider about any of the matters covered in the direction may be dealt with by Austel. In accordance with its powers of enforcement of class licence conditions, Austel also has power to investigate complaints about carrier associates not complying with the conditions of their class licence under part 15 of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a strong expectation that carrier associates will cooperate fully with Austel in the implementation of its direction and the administration of the relevant class licences. If it is necessary, we will seek any legislative amendment that may be appropriate to ensure that the clear intentions of the direction can be achieved. I hope that goes to address the concern that Senator Bourne raised on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston's amendment is essentially the tenor of what we expected. I am not sure we actually thought he would move an amendment but the tenor of his remarks was not surprising. He would no doubt be aware that the direction currently provides for the pay television exemption to cease on 1 July 1997, but that the government will review the exemption in the lead-up to that time in a situation where the environment is changing rapidly. To be absolutely specific in the detail about exactly what we are going to do in this rapidly changing environment in 30 June 1997 is extremely difficult and probably in the end not helpful, but the general principle is that if there is appropriate competition and only if that competition is there in the delivery of pay television using cable the government will allow the exemption to continue for the maximum period of five years, that is, until 30 June 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even then it will not be unlimited; it will a very brief extension. It is not a question of who is for competition and who is against; it is a question of whether three years or five years is the appropriate timetable and what develops over the next 18 months that enables us to make a balanced judgment about whether or not the three or the five is the appropriate timetable; keeping open that option but stating clearly the underlying principle that will determine the decision that we will make then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you get to making a decision, all the factors that go in and the principles that are applied to that evidence will have to be made public and be a matter of some debate here in the Senate and in the wider Australian community in the normal nature of decision making in a democracy. So for those reasons, while I think it is an issue of great import and it is appropriate that we have had the debate, the government will not be supporting either the disallowance motion or Senator Alston's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to record the Greens' views in relation to this motion of disallowance. I have read Senator Bourne's argument in relation to this proposal. We often hear about competition policy in Australia. What we really see throughout the world is not increasing competition but decreasing competition. Massive investment is required in areas of media and communications. We know that this is one of the few areas within our investment regulatory environment where there are still rules about the level of overseas ownership, the level of cross-ownership, and so on. Other industries are very quickly going into oligopoly or monopoly situations which are not particularly competitive. It simply means that there are not too many rules about what happens these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of major investments, we are getting massive oligopolies throughout the world. In Australia we are getting cross-ownership of the media, telecommunications, and the superhighway. It is of great concern that, when competition is mentioned, there is some level of understanding of what it means. If what we are doing in regulations is actually entrenching that global oligopoly or creating the potential to entrench the global oligopoly without allowing access for local participation, then perhaps we have to take it more carefully.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summing up, let me say that where Senator Alston and I disagree is in the area of whether competition diversity, technical content and new investment are encouraged by using the current flawed rules, or whether it is encouraged by removing those rules and forcing better rules to be drafted. I believe that removing the rules and forcing better rules to be drafted is preferable. I cannot agree with Senator Alston that leaving them there is a good thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan mentioned the Trade Practices Commission. That is something that I should have mentioned in the first place and I thank Senator McMullan for reminding me. As everyone here knows, in the past the Trade Practices Commission has viewed pay TV as a part of the free to air system in terms of competition. At the moment the commission is looking into the proposed merger between Foxtel and Galaxy. I hope the commission will look at the system in terms of competition in the pay TV system. If it does that, it will be obvious to anybody whether competition is enhanced or diminished by a merger of two of the three systems now operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear the minister say that Austel has wide powers in relation to disputes involving carrier associates. It was my understanding that it did not, but that it had wide powers in relation to disputes including carriers. I hope we can go back and have a look at Austel's exact powers. If Austel does not have those wide powers in relation to disputes involving associates, I would hope that we would try to give Austel much wider powers in that area as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston mentioned the separation of carrier and content. I think it is a good idea. I am glad that Senator Alston thinks it is a good idea. He may recall that this is one of the goals that I tried to achieve when the Broadcasting Services Act was debated in 1993. At that time Senator Alston found that he could not agree with me and, as a result, it was not included in the act. Perhaps he has changed his mind now. We will see what happens next time I try that one on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Margetts for her support. I agree that competition is diminishing all over the place at an extraordinarily rapid rate. That is certainly occurring in the pay TV industry at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course carriers want regulatory certainty. But if the carriers persist in using contortionist legal devices to ensure that they can get around the rules&mdash;which is exactly what they do all the time&mdash;then they must expect that the parliament, the ultimate regulator, will try to bring them back to the original spirit of the legislation. Let me just remind everybody that we are trying to achieve the promotion of competition, of diversity of content, of technical innovation and of new investment. I do not believe that this direction achieves any of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Senator Alston's amendment, I have said all along, for weeks, that I agree with what he is saying here. But this is second best to my motion. Certainly, this should not go until 1999; it should finish in 1997 at the absolute, complete and utter latest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I have pleasure in tabling this report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee on its inquiry into long-term unemployment. On 17 November 1994, the Senate asked the committee to inquire into these matters. Most specifically in relation to long-term unemployment, we were asked to inquire into three broad aspects: first, to examine the research on the causes of long-term unemployment; second, to evaluate established programs and current opportunities which enable the long-term unemployed to return to the work force and reveal any legislative or other regulatory mechanisms which constrain those opportunities; and, third, to identify, describe and evaluate alternative innovative strategies being implemented in Australia and elsewhere, which could lead to the re-engagement of the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That inquiry has now been completed after hearings held in all territory and state capitals, especially urban and suburban areas that are most affected by long-term unemployment&mdash;such as Campbelltown, on the outer edge of Sydney in New South Wales, and Broadmeadows in Victoria&mdash;as well as regional centres of high long-term unemployment&mdash;such as Tweed Heads, Whyalla, Burnie and Launceston. Evidence given in those hearings was collected along with 170 submissions, and they revealed that unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, is one of the most desperate problems facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One submission to the inquiry from a 42-year-old man who had been without full-time work for 12 years summarised the feeling expressed by many. He said, `I feel abandoned by the system, exploited by the system, abused by the system and held captive by the system.' A woman made redundant from a middle-management position by a municipal council amalgamation commented on how she was `avoided and made to feel a nuisance'. `There was,' she wrote, `a feeling of embarrassment on the part of my employers&mdash;a blame the victim mentality.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Losing a job for many of these people turns out to be the first shock. The difficulty of finding another job is the next. Many believed that they would not get another job. They learnt not to expect one to avoid that crippling sense of disappointment. We had on one occasion a man appear before us who had brought along his sheaf of 200 applications that he had put in for jobs over the last two years, and he had still not received a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term unemployed now comprise nearly a third of all Australia's unemployment&mdash;a massive rise over the last 10 years. Not only is this a misuse of Australia's human resources, but it multiplies all the ills that are attendant upon being unemployed. It is itself a significant contributor to unemployment. Several groups in our society suffer disproportionately&mdash;the youth, the older workers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people in some of the rural areas and in the outer suburbs, and people from non-English speaking background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been wide debate about the reasons for this unemployment and what are the appropriate solutions, but the fact is that the debate has produced little by way of major breakthrough to date in overcoming unemployment. This is the matter that gives this inquiry, and the results that come from it, some sense of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government heard a very wide range of evidence on what has been happening in this country with the unemployed and with the programs that governments have adopted to bring about a change. What we heard broadly&mdash;and the focus, of course, was on current programs&mdash;was that Working Nation is not working. Its failure is shown by the fact that, even during the huge boom that we were supposed to have had last year, although long-term employment did come down, there was still a very large entrenched pool of long-term unemployment in this country after the last recession, as there has been after each recession. What tends to happen after a recession is that there is a larger pool of long-term unemployed left than there was after the previous recession. This is a ratcheting up effect and is perhaps one of the most disturbing aspects of the development of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we looked at how government programs are addressing these problems, we found major concerns around the country. In the case of the labour market programs, we heard major criticisms of the fact that they were tending to churn the dole queues. There was a negative perception of training, and that perception was not confined to the unemployed. There were doubts over whether Working Nation was decreasing unemployment or merely recycling the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Churning the dole queue was an expression we heard in many hearings. The labour market programs seemed in a lot of instances to be recycling the participants, who may go into job training programs for six months but, when they come out at the end of it, a lot are not being placed. We also received evidence that what we are looking at is people being placed for six months and then returned to the ranks of the unemployed because the economic situation in the area is on the downturn. These people face the very real prospect of again becoming long-term unemployed. What we have had is a recycling factor as the dole queue was being churned. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Carr" NAMEID="AW5">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will get your chance in a minute, Senator Carr. We will get to the solutions. You have a look at the 24 recommendations which you should have agreed to. Programs recycling participants are just costly, short-term bandaids. It was stated in the evidence that participants in work experience programs such as Jobskill, after six months of feeling really happy and up and going, all of a sudden found their placement ended&mdash;and they were dead in their tracks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Many expressed despair at the outcomes of these programs. One very sad submission stated that it is more comfortable to remain lying in the gutter than to be picked up and dropped back again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this churning of these training programs involving some work and some training for the long-term unemployed, that is exactly what was happening to them because, in the end, half of them did not receive a job; they went back not to becoming long-term unemployed&mdash;by the government's definition&mdash;but to the start of the queue. They were newly unemployed, according to the government. So a lot of this drop in long-term unemployment has largely been an illusion. People have been redefined off the long-term unemployment list, just as we find broadly with unemployment that we have great numbers redefined off the list by being called mature age and picking up a benefit on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most interesting graphs in this report shows not only the government official unemployment rate but also the unofficial unemployment rate; all those people who are desperate to get work but cannot. It includes people who are maybe working a day a week and would really like to work five days a week; and people who have just given up. If you take these figures&mdash;and the statistics are in the report&mdash;you can in effect double the unemployment rate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a major tragedy that we face that when we got to the height&mdash;or should I say the depth&mdash;of the last recession, we had, in effect, not 11 per cent unemployment but a real unemployment rate of over 20 per cent. People were desperate to receive jobs but there was just no work available for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems with Working Nation and a lot of the government programs is that they are trying to hide the extent of the problem and make out that the rate is not as high as it is. There is a huge danger for society in that because if the public is lulled into a false sense of thinking, `Oh, the problem has been fixed,' when it has not been fixed, they do not give it a priority. We are storing up major long-term problems in society. We are developing a social underclass where in some cities and country areas there is more than one generation of unemployment; sometimes there are up to three generations. There are families where people have known no work at all. This not only does tremendous harm to society; it does great harm to individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the more serious criticisms in the report suggest that programs not followed by work are of little value in economic terms and harm the unemployed, particularly older workers. The two major programs, Jobstart and Jobskill, which are used for the long-term unemployed, have caused great resentment among people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to this report and to put before the Senate the minority report which has been prepared by government senators. This is obviously an important issue which all senators would share in terms of their concern about the very high and unacceptably high levels of unemployment in this country. This issue ought to have been able to attract broad support, but the politicisation of this matter, in terms of the election context, meant that was never possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report was commissioned on 17 November last year. Less than one year into the operation of Working Nation, you have made up your minds that this was a failure. You determined from the very beginning that we were going to have a political inquiry into the long-term unemployed. You resolved that and you have repeated that many times since. I refer to the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 5 July 1995&mdash;`Dr Kemp: Working Nation a failure'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have declared again and again that the whole issue of long-term unemployment was a political one. You would seek to exploit the misery and suffering of Australian workers. You sought to take miserable, political advantage of what is a very serious social problem in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have you said in terms of solutions? Not a word! The hypocrisy of coming in here with your crocodile tears! Your concern about the unemployed goes to the extent of not having one solution, not one answer to the inherent problems of inequality and poverty that exists in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> You had the opportunity, and this was a golden opportunity for the conservatives in this parliament, to actually come forward with your ideas on how to resolve this very difficult problem. You missed it. You squibbed it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When all is said and done, you only have one solution. That solution is to deregulate the labour market, to cut the wages and conditions of the Australian working people. That is your solution to unemployment. That is your solution to everything. Your solution is to destroy the organised labour movement in this country and, with that, the living conditions of working people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have you said in the report? We have the ideological shibboleths of the Liberal Party coming forward. The miserable and petty minded attitudes of the Liberal Party are coming forward yet again. Cut wages. Cut payroll tax. Undermine the working conditions of Australians. Return taxation powers to the states. It is quite clear in this report that is where you are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have suggestions which are quite clearly out of date. You have not recognised the statements made by the government last week. You are out of date again. You cannot even manage to organise your political stunts in such a way as to recognise the current position. What a pathetic effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You say Working Nation is a failure. You do not recognise the enormous success that has been achieved through Working Nation. For a start, you do not have the basic principle of having a political objective of trying to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said that its objective is to reduce unemployment to the rate of five per cent by the turn of the century. What is your suggestion? Nothing. You said, `It won't work.' That is it. That is as far as it goes. You do not have any policy to address fundamental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been success. You do not recognise that employment growth in this country has been remarkable. There have been historic highs. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>of Wednesday, 13 September, stated that the long-term jobless rate had dropped to a four-year low. This is the failure that you acknowledge! That is what you say is your position&mdash;failure. You predicate everything you do on the presumption of failure. The only failure here is your failure to come up with any workable solutions for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a drop in unemployment in this country. It has dropped to 8.5 per cent from 11.2 per cent. We are well on the way to achieving the target of five per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of vocational education and training, this government is doing more than any government in Australia's history. What do you say? You say we are doing too much. Your complaint is that the Labor government does too much. That is all you are about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You say we have to cut revenue and the expenditure of government. You say we have got to make sure the public sector is lean and mean. You are saying we cannot do as much as we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have any answers in terms of the real demands the Australian people are putting on all of us. In your majority report you have basically failed the fundamental test of politics in this country&mdash;that is, to come up with some ideas on what you are going to do. We indicate in our report a series of proposals that acknowledge the enormous contribution that Working Nation has made. We acknowledge that more can be done. We say that there is always more that can be done and not what you say, which is that too much is being done. We say that there could be more done in terms of industry policy. We say that more can be done in the area of the provision of physical and social infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the states are hacking away at the education systems of this country. They are hacking away at the health systems of this country. They are hacking away at the living conditions of Australians. They are undermining the work of the national government in terms of trying to restore full employment to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do you put? You put to us propositions such as the one that Mr Costello put to Prue Goward in June 1995, which was that $11.7 billion has to come out of the public sector. You say that the labour market has to be deregulated. What you really mean, as indicated by Mr Howard, is that the jobsback policy has to remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You say in terms of industrial relations and the freeing up of the labour market that workers' conditions have to be reduced. You say that workers are entitled to remain on an award. What you mean is that, given that 3.6 million workers will change their jobs every three years, 3.6 million workers will automatically be outside of your inadequate concept of a safety net. If we ever had a Liberal government, 3.6 million workers every three years would be faced with a situation, as we have seen in Western Australia and Victoria with Jeff Kennett, where contracts would be imposed. This would see a reduction in the standards of living for workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are suggesting is that there needs to be a sustained period of economic growth. Only a Labor government can deliver sustained economic growth. We say that there has to be a stop to the states hacking into the social fabric of this country. There ought to be things done in relation to further provisions in social security in the longer term as we move towards achieving five per cent unemployment. It will be difficult to get below five per cent and additional measures will have to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be more work done in the education area and there have to be provisions made to make sure that the states do their jobs in ensuring that retention rates are maintained. There has to be work done in terms of higher education to ensure that the employment and growth implications of the higher education sector are realised. In that regard, we drew attention to a report prepared by DEET, which is a couple of years old, which looks at creating economic growth through enterprise generation and industry research partnerships. We suggest that more action can be taken there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We suggest that more work can be done in terms of industry policy. We are hoping that the government's innovation statement will provide the vehicle to achieve that. We want to see the high performance industries encouraged, the import replacement industries encouraged, the expansion of export industries encouraged and the promotion of industry modernisation. There ought to be closer partnerships between employers and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying is that in terms of attitudes you have failed yet again. You have sought to have one policy articulated which slashes workers' pay and conditions, undermines public sector conditions and destroys the social wage. That means that under a Liberal government very large numbers of people would suffer in terms of wages, conditions and services provided such as education, health and housing. Your policies would exacerbate unemployment and the inequalities of wealth and power in this society. As a consequence, you do not have any answers other than making the situation worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to comment on the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee report. I would like to draw attention to Senator Carr's usual tired diatribe on the inadequacies of state Liberal governments. Why should Working Nation not be subject to scrutiny, Senator Carr, in view of the vast amounts of government money that is spent on the schemes that you list on page after page of the minority report? Why should we not look at these schemes to see if they are working properly?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would be surprised to learn that some of the schemes which we looked at are working properly&mdash;so properly and so successfully that the most successful ones were promptly chopped off and made redundant so they did not apply to the unemployed anymore.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this majority report, we have made recommendation after recommendation of the way in which the existing programs could be made to work better. For instance, recommendation No. 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that mature age workers (35 and over) who become unemployed be eligible to access labour market programs within three months of becoming unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>In that way they would get quicker access to being re-placed into the employment market. As Senator Tierney said, it has only been reduced to six months, not 12 months. The committee also recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . mature age workers be eligible to access case management assistance and advice in the months preceding the loss of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they do not have to be unemployed to have access to case management advice, which in many cases takes many months. Recommendation No. 3 states:</PARA>

The manager of a Victorian non-government agency confirmed there were increasing distress levels and an increase in loss of identity among the young with continuing unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area most severely affected by long-term unemployment is outer west Melbourne where the long-term unemployment rate is eight per cent. My electorate office is in Broadmeadows, which incorporates this region. I had a gentleman in my office the other week who was literally crying with frustration because he had been unemployed for two years and he did not know where to turn. If all these programs are working so successfully, why can he not get a job?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the hearing we saw witnesses who came from regions such as Broadmeadows who have been stigmatised by unemployment. One young person from Campbelltown, south-west of Sydney, said, `I lived in Campbelltown and people did not want people from Campbelltown.' Those offering training and employment services in the area also spoke of difficulties in placing people in employment because of the stigma attached to the region. There is no doubt that unemployment has become endemic in certain regions. Another frequent criticism heard during the hearing, and one which the coalition has made often, was that all the training programs in the world are useless if there are no jobs at the end of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will need them in the run up to the election. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the shadow minister for employment, has regularly stressed concern that training programs are used merely as a smokescreen to get people off the unemployment queues. It is a well-known fact that people only need to be in training or study for one hour per week to be removed from the unemployment statistics, and that no doubt accounts for the drop in unemployment statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Page 60 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Too often there was a mismatch between the training offered, the talents and abilities of the unemployed person and local employment opportunities. There was a perception among the older unemployed, many of the long term unemployed and the jobless in regional areas with severe structural unemployment that no amount of training will make a difference, and that DEET programs are no more than time fillers.</PARA>
<PARA>People finish the training programs and start looking for a job. Because they have been trained wrongly or the training program is out of date, there is simply no job for which they can apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Australian executive officer of a training scheme in Whyalla concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . people are sick and tired of training for the sake of it . . . They are disillusioned with training programs that get them nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA>There appear to be many elements in this debate. One of the strong facts that came out was that people need to be picked up in the very early months of unemployment while they still have job skills and motivation. One witness said this to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to get to people before they become demotivated and totally debilitated.</PARA>
<PARA>There appears to be an element of self-perpetuation in trying to solve long-term unemployment only by waiting until people enter long-term unemployment. The solution must be in part preventative, with early intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need greater flexibility in the delivery of services. When you are over 35 or 40, time becomes very important. You cannot afford to wait six or 12 months, because you slip further behind in the job stakes. This was also highlighted in relation to non-English speaking background job seekers. Not only do non-English speaking background job seekers have difficulty in relation to the problem of unemployment itself; they also face a language barrier. While the minority report quotes that language programs are available to people, they are not the sorts of language programs that are needed to get people ready for employment. This was another element of the debate brought out in Broadmeadows. It is an area with a large ethnic population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need much greater flexibility and a much greater sharpening of focus on local problems and the way in which they can be addressed. We heard of some excellent initiatives during the hearings. One was the Forty Plus Employment Group in Ballarat. This group was formed in 1993. It evolved from a vocational services project of the Ballarat rotary clubs. In February this year, they opened an Aussie Workways Enterprise Centre. It was designed to allow mature age unemployed people to work together and assist each other. The main purpose of the group was to establish viable and sustainable enterprises. At this point of debate, there are now over 100 people involved in the organisation. They have a five-year plan to establish Aussie Workways as a major facility for employment generation in Ballarat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of initiative should be encouraged. Local people know best what local jobs are available and the sort of training that should be available in their local area. As I said, some successful programs have been shut down. We came across instances of JPET in Tweed Heads and Burnie being shut down because it worked well. A job club situated outside a Brisbane jail assisted ex-prisoners to find jobs. It worked well, so it was shut down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solutions to long-term unemployment need to be wider ranging than training programs, which have been shown to have very little credibility in the community. A whole extra range of policies should be adopted. Senator Carr's list of programs is there. No-one denies that the programs exist, but they are not working. He needs to concentrate on outcomes, not processes. I commend this committee's report. I endorse its recommendations. I also commend the work of the secretariat. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The select committee was established to focus on certain Queensland whistleblower cases and their lessons for the Commonwealth legislation on whistleblower protection which had been proposed by the Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. The Senate agreed to widen the committee's inquiry to include other cases arising from the previous select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the committee received a significant number of submissions from other people who gave evidence or provided submissions to the previous committee and a number of additional cases were also referred to the committee by way of submission. In order to meet its terms of reference and to give sufficient consideration to cases, the committee agreed that it could only focus on those cases involving people who had given evidence to the previous committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee understands the disappointment of many people who made submissions to it on the understanding that the committee may have been able to take up their case. We sympathise with the dilemma many of these people were in as a result of their whistleblowing. We found their submissions valuable in helping us to appreciate the widespread nature of whistleblowers' concerns and in clarifying many of the issues relevant to whistleblower protection legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's inquiry reinforced the conclusions and recommendations of the Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. The committee repeatedly heard of the devastating impact that whistleblowing had on the lives of the people involved. Many of the people who gave evidence suffered employment-related reprisals and their health and family life were adversely affected. This evidence supported the need for whistleblower protection legislation as recommended by the previous committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, legislation may not be able to cover all contingencies envisaged by whistleblowers. The committee acknowledges that a number of states and the ACT have already enacted legislation in this area. It recognises the jurisdictional and constitutional difficulties requiring separate Commonwealth and state legislation, but considers the formulation of uniform and complementary legislation as essential if we are to achieve a fairer and more equitable process in the area of whistleblowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee agrees that attitudinal change towards whistleblowers and the investigation of their complaints is imperative within public and private sector organisations and the community generally. The committee notes that public sector developments in ethics awareness and fraud control are taking place. It is essential, however, that if these developments are to have value, they must be strongly promoted and encouraged by senior management and not simply remain as rhetoric. The Public Service Commission and its new commissioner have a crucial role to play in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cases considered by the committee demonstrate the difficulties people have in raising their concerns and having them investigated in an objective and independent manner. So often whistleblowers were frustrated in their attempts to right perceived wrongs by investigations limited by the letter of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These difficulties, when combined with reprisals and detrimental consequences for health and family, often resulted in a loss of faith in the system&mdash;which is supposedly designed to protect and support them&mdash;and generated a general feeling of helplessness. This can force whistleblowers into obsessive behaviour and pursuit of their case with a consuming passion which can then result in a loss of judgment and objectivity in their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whistleblowers who gave evidence to the committee constantly emphasised the need for independence in public disclosure or whistleblower protection legislation. The previous committee concluded&mdash;and this committee concurs&mdash;that at the Commonwealth level the most appropriate approach is to establish a small yet powerful independent oversighting agency directed and controlled by a board consisting of representatives from government, parliament, whistleblower and community groups. This approach recognises that investigation of complaints and protection of whistleblowers should be primarily undertaken by existing organisations but with oversight by the proposed agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee acknowledges the concerns that whistleblowers have with the capabilities of a number of existing organisations. The committee believes that with the strengthening through legislative means of the powers and responsibilities of these organisations, they should develop a greater empathy with whistleblowers and a greater responsiveness to their disclosures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the committee also discussed a number of detailed issues relating to whistleblower protection legislation. They include the importance of an initial independent screening to sift the vexatious and trivial allegations from genuine public interest disclosures. People whose disclosures came within the auspices of proposed whistleblower protection legislation could be assured of being directed to an appropriate place for their disclosure to be examined. In this way, no whistleblower would be stranded without knowing where to turn for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues considered by the committee included the provision of counselling, support, advice and assistance; the conduct of investigations, in particular the public interest value of open hearings and the application of rules of natural justice, not just for the whistleblower but, equally importantly, for the subject of any allegations; access to legal aid and assistance; retrospectivity in legislation; and recourse to the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of witnesses and cases, one of the key witnesses to the inquiry was the CJC, which is established under Queensland legislation. It is the responsibility of the Queensland Parliament to determine the functions and powers of the CJC and how it performs its duties. The committee was mindful that a comprehensive report reviewing the CJC had been presented by the Queensland parliamentary committee oversighting the CJC earlier this year and was still under consideration. The committee focused on the role and conduct of the Criminal Justice Commission only in relation to the whistleblower cases it considered. Nevertheless, the committee made a number of observations concerning the CJC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that the CJC was established as a direct result of the Fitzgerald inquiry. It is an independent and highly powerful organisation. Although the Fitzgerald report highlighted the difficulties of balancing accountability with the need for independence, the resultant accountability is limited. A person dissatisfied with the actions or conduct of the CJC has recourse to the Supreme Court or a parliamentary monitoring committee. The committee is aware of reports in the Queensland media critical of the CJC. It is possible that these critical reports result from the limited accountability options available to people so that they turn in frustration to the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CJC appears to have adopted an embattled and very defensive approach in response to criticism. It has responded in several cases by attacking individuals at a personal level. Whether or not these people provoke such a response by outrageous allegations of their own is immaterial. I do not believe that it brings credit upon a public institution to respond in such a vitriolic manner. Whistleblowers can have no respect for such an organisation and are deterred from seeking assistance from it. The committee was concerned from the evidence it received at the CJC's approach to investigations. The CJC indicated that it was constrained in what it can do by the powers prescribed under its act. Whilst accepting this, the committee believes that the CJC could have done more within its powers to investigate certain cases more fully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the cases considered by the committee I would like to make a number of personal comments. In respect of the shredding of the Heiner documents I do not believe there is any evidence of a political conspiracy on behalf of the government. A newly elected government was confronted with a problem created during the term of the previous administration. The government sought advice through the correct channels and, irrespective of whether that advice was correct or not, it acted upon the advice it was given. Nevertheless, from an administrative viewpoint the individuals involved could certainly have been handled more considerately and lot of unnecessary stress and heartache for them could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the matter of Gordon Harris and John Reynolds, it is clear to me that the actions taken against Mr Harris and Mr Reynolds demonstrated a classic whistleblower dilemma whereby the whistleblower, rather than the disclosures, becomes the focus of attention.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The investigations, court cases and appeals to which Mr Harris and Mr Reynolds have been subjected boiled down to Mr Harris being found guilty of disclosing information contrary to the Police Administration Act&mdash;an offence determined by a magistrate to be so trivial, and with such mitigating circumstances, that Mr Harris was discharged without having a conviction recorded. It was the committee's view that the severity of the reprisals to which Gordon Harris and John Reynolds were subjected could not be justified and I believe the state should consider some form of compensation for these two people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other cases considered by the committee all demonstrated in their own way aspects of the problems encountered by whistleblowers and deficiencies in the current systems in which they must seek resolution to their claims. A particular problem, highlighted in the case of Mr Bill Toomer, is that of considering cases many years after they have occurred. Witnesses have moved on&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the coalition, I rise to speak on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1995. This bill gives the force of law in Australia to a comprehensive double-tax agreement signed with the Czech Republic on 28 March this year for the prevention of double taxation and the prevention of avoidance of taxes on income flows between the two treaty partners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement prevents double taxation by allocating taxing rights to Australia or to the Czech Republic on all forms of income flow between the two countries. The basis of allocating the rights is substantially similar to that adopted in Australia's other modern double-taxation agreements, such as that which was signed with New Zealand earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement affects all taxpayers who for the purposes of the double-tax agreement are residents of either Australia or the Czech Republic and who derive income, profits or gains from the other country. The double-taxation agreement applies to Australian income tax and resource rent tax in respect of offshore petroleum products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement relates to fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. It does not extend to sales tax, fringe benefits tax, wool tax and levies, customs duties, state taxes and duties, and the Medicare levy. Similarly, it applies to taxes on income within the Czech Republic. The agreement will automatically extend to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are subsequently imposed by either country in addition to, or in the place of, existing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of special features in the agreement which relate to dividend withholding tax, interest on royalties, capital gains and the exchange of information.

Such a work force, while perhaps ready to accept work in the future, will today remain unemployed unless their skills are made relevant to the business environment of here and now. It is merely frustrating and demoralising to allow an individual to be trained or educated in the belief that employment will follow when the training fails to be targeted and has no hope of resulting in long-term work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If our educational and training regimes are not leading to employment in a growing and expanding economy, then I suggest there is something disturbingly wrong. So how should we assess the schemes and programs currently operated by the Labor government in this area of vocational education and training?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would venture the proposition that the first step in evaluation is to determine the goal of the program. In making this evaluation, we can look to the words of the government or we can look to the priorities of the government as evidenced by how the government spends taxpayers' money. While I enjoy reading the government's words, I think it might be more rational and enlightening to examine where the government puts the money. Clearly, while words are cheap, it is actions that pay the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget papers&mdash;1995-96&mdash;the government indicates that it will spend $850 million on vocational and other education over the financial year. This amounts to 7.94 per cent of the Commonwealth's spending on education. Of the $850 million, the vast majority is spent on technical and further education, with just $19.9 million being spent on other vocational education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's primary involvement in vocational education and training is conducted through a joint Commonwealth-state body, the Australian National Training Authority. Under the ANTA agreement, states are required to maintain their effort in vocational education and training, while the Commonwealth has committed itself to maintaining its levels of financial support and to provide further growth funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the Senate provides increases of $9.469 million in 1995 and $9.192 million next year, in 1996, to the current legislated amounts. The bill also provides a total of $949.88 million in general funding, which includes $22.7 million for off-the-job training to ANTA in 1997 under Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time I could criticise the government for its mathematical gymnastics in reducing funds to the states over the next three years through adjustments to the process of indexation. However, as these reported savings are in fact only notional and cannot be guaranteed, I shall pass over that issue. The amounts to be appropriated to the vocational education and training area are significant, and it is important that we are able to assess whether their expenditure actually returns an appropriate value to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that I believe this funding does return value to the community. However, I do not believe the funds are being used to the maximum possible advantage. In this opinion I am no Robinson Crusoe. Major recent research has highlighted the weaknesses in both our system of providing vocational training and the form that that training should take. In the Karpin report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprising Nation</EMPHASIS>, the following statement was made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it appears incontrovertible that Australian enterprises, training providers and educational institutions are not moving quickly enough to address the new paradigm of management. Many of our counterparts overseas, and especially the leaders in the various fields of industry and education, are changing more rapidly and more extensively, and will be better prepared for the next century.</PARA>
<PARA>What Karpin has said is clear. The world does not owe Australia a living and it is moving ahead of us now. We must get moving and react more quickly with better training or risk the potential of being left behind. The writing is on the wall and the message is clear. Either we must establish a vocational education and training structure and a system which is capable of a flexible response to the changing circumstances of modern commerce, or we will be an economic and social backwater not only in our own geographic region but also in the world as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What this will mean is a lower standard of living, greater pressure to sell off our nation's assets and even greater pressure to exploit the vulnerable. Our social safety net will be useless if each and every one of us needs to have recourse to it just to live above the poverty line. So where does our system currently stand? Is it flexible and achievement oriented enough? Does it respond to business, commerce and industry needs or is its existence an end in itself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August this year, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia&mdash;known as CEDA&mdash;released the outcomes of its review of the national training reform agenda. That report concluded that progress had been slow and that the new training structures were too bureaucratic, overly complex and irrelevant to the needs of many enterprises. The report also concluded that the national training reform agenda suffered from a lack of industry involvement. These are very disturbing findings. If our training and education agenda is based on a stifling, complex bureaucracy, which excludes the very people that ultimately must employ the newly trained, then we are patently wasting not only money but also the future potential of thousands of Australians that undertake these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I note that there are two inquiries currently being conducted into the training reform agenda. I trust that those inquiries will lead to a vocational education and training system which is focused on employment outcomes and on the needs of industry and business, and targeted to produce world best results. I trust that these outcomes are the intention of the government. I further trust that they and all involved parties, including the Commonwealth and state bureaucrats, will commit themselves to achieving these results without ego or the positioning for theoretical control and power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister and Cabinet (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1995 is an omnibus bill which amends four separate acts, the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983, the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952, the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965 and the Public Service Act 1992. It is a non-controversial bill, in all aspects, and the coalition will not be opposing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the main provisions of the bill seeks to amend the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983. The bill abolishes the Economic Planning Advisory Council, known as EPAC, and establishes the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. This follows an announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 16 August 1994 that he was establishing a new, so-called economic round table to replace EPAC and that EPAC would be re-established as the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure what has happened to the economic round table proposal. This bill, as I understand it, is solely concerned with the abolition of the Economic Planning Advisory Council and the establishment of an Economic Planning Advisory Commission. The council was a creature of the previous Labor government. It was established after the national economic summit of March 1983. It was intended to bring together business, unions and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EPAC has, over the years, fulfilled in many ways a useful role. We have all had criticisms of EPAC from time to time; some of those I have agreed with. Overall, EPAC did play a useful role in various respects. However, like the Accord&mdash;and, importantly, it did flow from the Accord&mdash;and this government, it has apparently outlived its purpose and will be replaced by the commission. It does away with the auspices of tripartite consultation and will concentrate, I understand, more on advice to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission is a creature of government. If it is going to be providing advice, fearlessly to government, it does really need to have a surety of its independence. There is no guarantee, either in this bill or anywhere else as far as I am aware, of independence. That is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the commission will, in carrying out its work, be able to work on the basis that the only useful advice to government is advice that it can convey independently and without fear of retribution if it gives to government advice that the government does not necessarily want to hear. That is a very important aspect. I hope that the government will take that on board in the operation of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and third acts that are amended by this bill are parliamentary acts&mdash;the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 and the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965. The bills makes minor technical amendments to both of these acts, principally to remove gender specific language and to update title references.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth act being amended by the bill is the Public Service Act 1992. The bill amends the Public Service Act to implement the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts to require departments to report to the parliament by 31 October each year. To do that, the bill also requires that annual reports be presented to ministers by the 15 October, to enable that reporting to the parliament by the 31 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes arrangements for reporting when parliament is not sitting. It allows the minister to grant exemptions from the deadline, subject to advising the parliament. It also provides for the granting to presiding officers of the ability to delegate various personnel and management tasks. The coalition has no problems with those amendments. They seem sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reporting of annual reports to parliament is an essential process now that the old system of estimates committees has changed. Much more reliance is now placed on the annual reports of departments and agencies. They have become a crucial core element of the data and information available to the parliament for the examination of the workings of government. Therefore, the amendment in this bill to the Public Service Act is a very important amendment. </PARA>

I would draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that there is an increasing tendency for opposition senators to raise points of order very early in an answer, perhaps with a view to disrupting the answer being given.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point I make about the devil is that on a contrast&mdash;this government compared with the coalition when it was last in office&mdash;you were at the headline rate of 11.4 per cent. The headline rate you are complaining about now is 5.1 per cent. As the Treasurer and as the Prime Minister have both made clear&mdash;and, indeed, many economic commentators have supported their view&mdash;the underlying rate is probably the more appropriate rate because it is shorn of high volatile factors, seasonal fluctuations and government charges. The underlying rate and the headline rate are such that they are within the budget forecasts and are, therefore, consistent with current economic policy. They are within the forecasts we made in the budget in May of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question invites me to compare us with the rest of the world. One of the things is that you cannot compare economic indicators in isolation from other economic indicators. In relation to the rest of the world, the first thing you would ask is: are the other indicators of inflation measuring the same things as the levels of inflation being measured in Australia? When you ask yourself that question and look at the other indicators, the answer is that they are not, by and large. The headline rate in other countries, by and large, excludes all issues under the statistical category `shelter', which is to say that it does not include what would be the mortgage repayments, interest rates on home loans and things of that nature in other economies. So the first point about this comparison, `Is it apples to apples?', is that it is not apples to apples; it is an apples to oranges comparison&mdash;and you should get the comparison of your statistics right, Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is the more important one, because you cannot separate the interdependence, as I have said, of economic indicators. Look at the growth levels in Australia compared with the growth levels in the economies of the countries, Senator Hill, you are referring to. You often like to quote the rear pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine. Let me look at its economic indicators page. Under the heading `Economic GDP Forecasts for 1995', it says that Australia has the second highest growth of all the developed economies mentioned there and well above a number of the significant economies that you compare our inflation rate with. If you look to the forecast for 1996 where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> forecasters predict what growth will be in the economies, Australia is equal first in the world for economic growth.</PARA>

There are a number of reasons why we do not, but the chief one among them is that this would effectively break up the federation of Australia and turn it into, instead of being one country with a central government, a series of small countries based on the states and the territories.

Each individual state would then be able to vary its 16 per cent marginal rate to suit their own ends. What that would mean is New South Wales and Victoria would be better off by over $1 billion each; Queensland and South Australia would lose over $700 million each; Western Australia would lose $220 million; Tasmania would lose $360 million; and the Northern Territory, for some reason&mdash;obviously, the Liberals do not like them up there in the territory&mdash;would lose $837 million.</PARA>

They were being dealt with in court cases. We redefined the sweeper clauses, as they are called, in the bill to ensure that the original policy intent of this measure introduced by the Fraser government in 1982 would continue. The diesel fuel rebate scheme means that the mining industry in this country gets the benefit of $600 million in revenue forgone on excise. The agricultural industry gets $400 million. That is over $1 billion of revenue forgone, because that is the policy intent of the government. We will stick to that policy intent. With these further amendments, the opposition is trying to expand the intent of the bill beyond what it was originally designed for.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have given large figures, but that is indicative of the large pool of investment generated in superannuation by the policies of this government making superannuation a right for every Australian worker and not the prerogative of those who are in high paid jobs or work in the Public Service, as applied when the coalition were in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made superannuation a right for all workers&mdash;the lowest paid and the highest paid&mdash;and not just an exclusive group.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was saying that, yes, tax concessions are provided by Australian taxpayers to superannuation funds and that does give us, as a government, a right to express views and take action about superannuation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that superannuation funds have the savings of ordinary Australians to invest and that the obligation on those funds is to give the best possible return for ordinary Australians who will be the beneficiaries as superannuants of those funds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do think&mdash;and the Prime Minister has colourfully expressed himself on this a couple of times in the last week&mdash;that the direction of funds' investment is not balanced when it comes to considering the need of developmental and venture capital in Australia; that is, investing in companies that want to start business and investing in companies that have just got started and have bright prospects but cannot attract investment in either equity or capital to grow beyond their smaller levels. That is a distortion in our market.</PARA>

If their capital is starved, it is harder for them to grow and bring Australian brand names to the international marketplace. The Prime Minister was talking about that distortion.

This program, started in May of last year, is the single biggest effort by any Australian government in history to deal with the issue of unemployment.

We have a detailed policy which, after some 18 months, as has already been explained to you and many others, has worked successfully to significantly reduce unemployment in Australia, particularly long-term unemployment.

At that time this was a significant achievement in the face of strong international competition.

I am able to say that today I announced and published the exposure draft of the amendments to the Trade Practices Act that will give small business a better go in their economic relationship and business relationship with big business in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that there has been some criticism that this could create commercial uncertainty. I reject completely those suggestions. The amendments we are seeking to make to the Trade Practices Act are already in existence in many other Western economies without any suggestion of creating uncertainty in business transactions. The amendments are aimed to create better business conduct in Australia between both big business and small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments do not discriminate in favour of small business. In fact, in the draft discussion paper I released today we give an example of where the economic power of a small business was used to get a more favourable position out of a big business than normally would have been warranted. But overwhelmingly, the amendments are drafted to help small business. In conjunction with the establishment of the small business unit within the new ACCC, the new competition commission that is being created, small business will have relevant advice immediately available to them on how they can seek remedy if they feel they are being harshly dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most striking feature since I made this announcement in principle over a month ago is that the opposition have yet to declare their position on this issue. I waited for a month because their response initially was, `We haven't seen the actual words of what the amendment would be in legal terms.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today it is being released. I now say to the opposition, and to Mr Howard in particular who has gone around this country for the last few months saying that one of the major issues he will be campaigning on is a better go for small business, that this amendment to the Trade Practices Act is all about giving small business in this country a better go. Yet, for a month, Mr Howard has not commented on this issue. The draft is now before him, and I think he is required to respond since he wants to make small business a major issue in the coming election campaign. He cannot go around telling small business he is all in favour of their issues when the fundamental response of small business organisations, through the Small Business Forum, overwhelmingly supports these amendments. They have done so because they see the benefits that they are going to get.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are five parts to that question. I am not sure that I can deal with them all in four minutes but I will do what I can. With regard to the requirement for carrier co-location, the national code requires that, if a carrier installs or relocates a telecommunications tower or similar structure, the carrier must locate the new facility on an existing tower or as close as possible to an existing tower unless it is not feasible on technical grounds, unless it is incompatible with configuration or intended configuration of the carrier's network or unless it is likely to have greater adverse effect on the environment than putting the new facility in another place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code also requires that a carrier cooperate with other carriers in sharing sites and planning the provision of future telecommunications services. Again, this is unless it is not technically feasible, is incompatible with network configuration or has an adverse impact on the environment. I understand Austel has initiated discussions with the carriers on their endeavours to co-locate and two of the carriers have developed an agreement relating to co-location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to local councils' knowledge of their rights, the Minister for Communications and the Arts has written twice this year, providing information that will assist local councils in understanding their role and responsibilities under the telecommunications national code. The first letter also provided councils with an information package relating to the national code, containing a detailed plain English guide to the provisions of the code, a copy of the code, the regulations and a list of contacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second letter was written to further ensure that councils were aware of their rights and responsibilities under the code. It emphasised that carriers must notify local councils in writing of proposals to construct telecommunications facilities and must provide enough information at the time of notification to enable the council to assess the activity. The letter also advised that, for mobile towers, when the council and the carrier have not reached agreement during the consultation process about the environmental impact of a proposed installation or modification of a tower, the council can require the carrier to refer the proposal to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both letters to the local councils notified them that, if they considered a carrier was not fulfilling its obligations under the code&mdash;including making an incorrect decision&mdash;they could refer the matter to Austel, which has the power under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to enforce carrier compliance with the code. In addition, the carriers and the Municipal Association of Victoria have agreed to a guideline on community notification and consultation. The government expects carriers to endeavour to apply this guideline throughout Australia. The minister wrote to carriers in October this year seeking a report on their progress in implementing these guidelines in Victoria and nationwide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With regard to the improvement of information that carriers supply to councils, the code requires carriers to provide local councils with full details of any proposed activity in their local area. If local carriers are not satisfied with the information, the national code enables them on at least two occasions to seek additional information from the carrier. The information package that the minister supplied to councils explains these rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With regard to ensuring local councils have enough time, to ensure that there cannot be indefinite delays to the carriers roll-out there needs to be some upper limit placed on the period of consultation. But to enable meaningful consultation to take place and solutions to be worked through, new consultation procedures were specified in the current code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to encouraging carriers to fully comply with planning, et cetera, the parliament decided to exempt all three carriers by regulations made under the Telecommunications Act 1991. These exemptions are necessary to ensure that benefits to the public are not prevented. But, when undertaking an exempt activity, the carriers must comply with the obligations imposed by the telecommunications national code and with all relevant state and territory laws that are not specified in the telecommunications exempt activities regulations.</PARA>

Despite Mr Lavarch's promise to his constituents, will assistance to other landowners be limited to the government's 1990 policy of no responsibility?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1990, the Prime Minister and the premiers discussed the question of unexploded ordnance&mdash;which is not necessarily dangerous material but in some cases is. The decision was to review all sites around Australia, which comes to 1,070. So the government is progressively doing that. At the moment I think some seven sites have been reviewed, going through the past records and history. Once those reviews are available, they go to the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage and they, in fact, do the classifying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nub of the problem is that in some cases, of course, there is lack of knowledge or lack of proper advice to the Queensland department as to how to classify. The difficulty is that from the production of the first report, which is a very broad-brush one, to the defining of actual areas affected there is always that no-man zone, if you like, in which worry occurs as to whether property is affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases many of these properties, arising out of activities in the Second World War, had compensation offered or paid for any unexploded ordnance or any other contamination of the property. Therefore, all accounts are settled. In some instances, no compensation was either offered or accepted at the time. Basically, that is the case in Mr Lavarch's area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument was not whether those property holders would have their property marked as contaminated; it was: what advice would we in Defence give the Department of Environment and Heritage? One of the things we offered at least&mdash;and our view is that most of that area is not contaminated; therefore, the title should not be amended to show it is contaminated&mdash;was a random sample. That is the only thing that has been offered to Mr Lavarch's electorate&mdash;a random sample, on the basis that compensation was never paid, so that we can clearly define the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other six areas so far in which reports have come in in Queensland, it is necessary for us to give advice to the Department of Environment and Heritage as to what our view is of the contamination. On these other sites the historical records are far more accurate, but there may be occasions when we also have to opt for random sampling in some of those areas too if we are uncertain as to what advice to give the Department of Environment and Heritage in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also trying to do an overarching plan between the two departments to come up with a methodology that will be consistently applied through Queensland&mdash;something that has not been done before, and maybe something that should have been done earlier&mdash;so that you will not have these sorts of scare campaigns, which I am sure you have picked up, that are often run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in answer to your question, what we are doing about it is making recommendations to the Department of Environment and Heritage so that they can, in fact, classify the land. Where no compensation has been paid, which is not necessarily obvious at the moment, that will be a matter for future government policy. But where compensation has been paid in the past, it is up to the landholder to then rectify whatever problem is on that land. We cannot have double dipping. The one thing I also assure you about is that, if any dangerous ordnance is found, Defence then goes to the assistance of the landholder and defuses and deals with the problem without any charge to the landholder at all.</PARA>

This is an overriding rule: that a question must seek information, or press for action within a minister's responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>His diversion into matters in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> had no relationship at all to his portfolio. He simply went out on a frolic of his own in an effort, he thought, to embarrass the opposition. It was as relevant as if he had got up and answered a question on the state of the weather in Western Australia. He is here to answer questions relating to the administration of his portfolio or ministerial matters. That is why I took the point of order. You might say that, on balance, you were not convinced; but to simply say there was no point of order and dismiss it in that way I thought was a trifle unreasonable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet thought it more appropriate to direct that question, as they often do, to another portfolio for answer. They directed it to Treasury for answer. Treasury, however, before they can answer that, have sought advice from Attorney-General's and the Reserve Bank as to whether they can even answer the question. That is where the matter rests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in question time Senator Boswell asked me a question where he asserted that AQIS has only two plant technologists. The reason I did not answer the question at that time was that I did not know what a plant technologist was. It is not an expression that is familiar to me. I thought there may have been a classification of plant technologist and I wanted to give Senator Boswell the most accurate answer possible. I have, in fact, determined that there is no such thing as a plant technologist within AQIS and that&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assumed, Senator Boswell&mdash;and thank you for your interjection&mdash;that you were talking about entomologists. `Plant technologists' simply refers to people with scientific qualifications engaged in AQIS to deal with plants. That being the case, Senator Boswell's claim that there are only two is, in fact, nonsense. The situation is that AQIS either employs or has access to a wide range of high level expertise in plant science&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator Boswell</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen, Senator Boswell, I will answer the question precisely. You heard what I said. AQIS either employs or has access to a wide range of high level expertise in plant science, including entomologists, plant pathologists, botanists and staff with other relevant scientific qualifications. AQIS employs directly 28 scientific positions of people who are in the plant quarantine and export area but have scientific qualifications in those areas&mdash;that is, plant pathologists, botanists, entomologists, and so on. Twenty-eight, Senator Boswell, so I do not know where you got your figure of two from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 14 positions within AQIS that handle quarantine policy issues in international market access matters. There are 14 positions responsible for technical operational issues in plant quarantine, import clearance and export inspection. In addition, AQIS engages directly, through its state operations, the services of a further 19.3 full-time equivalent plant scientific staff who handle day-to-day program delivery issues. In some cases, these are permanent full-time jobs, and in other cases AQIS engages state specialists, as necessary, on a contract basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, as I pointed out before, AQIS has direct access, as necessary, to the plant scientists within the Bureau of Resource Sciences, which, of course, is also within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. In addition, AQIS contracts, as necessary, high level scientific expertise within the CSIRO, universities and other research institutions. I think that demonstrates, comprehensively, I might add, that Senator Boswell's assertion in the Senate yesterday, which he followed up with a press statement last night, that AQIS has only two people with technical or scientific qualifications in this area is a nonsense.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to the funding of trade unions .</PARA>
<PARA>I asked the minister whether he could confirm that answers I had received from questions that I had put to ministers over recent years about these payments, which show that well over $90 million has been paid to the unions in direct grant funding, and that even this huge figure excludes certain large payments&mdash;for example, the funding of the Trade Union Training Authority that costs around $10 million per year. When you add up all the money that has gone from this government to the trade union movement in the 12 years since Labor came to power in 1983, on a very conservative estimate, the figure would be a minimum of $160 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That money has been used in a wide range of areas, including in particular to pay back the trade union movement for contributions that it has made to Labor's election campaigns. During the 1993 election campaign, for example, the trade union movement gave $3.5 million to Labor to assist in the funding of the election campaign. It gave direct donations of $2.1 million and engaged in an advertising campaign in support of the government which cost about $1.3 million or $1.4 million&mdash;a total of $3 1/2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did it get in return? It got Labor elected. Let there be no doubt that that was the whole objective of the trade union involvement in 1993. We will certainly never forget the statement by Jennie George, the then Assistant Secretary of the ACTU and now President of the ACTU, after the election that it was the trade union movement that had won the election for Labor. There was never any doubt that that was the sole purpose of the union movement's activities in the run-up to the 1993 election. It paid them pretty handsomely because since the election the trade union movement has received a minimum of $26 million of taxpayers' funds to fund a whole range of activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You certainly left out a chunk of others who get money&mdash;namely, a lot of employers. If we look at the accurate figures for 1988-89 to now and look at the moneys that have been distributed by the Department of Industrial Relations between employers and unions we find that nearly $21 million has been granted to unions for various purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at employers, we find that nearly $43 million has been granted. I do not hear you complaining about that, Senator Short. I do not hear the opposition complaining about the fact that that is taxpayers' money too. You might think there might be some objection from taxpayers about that portion of the money. Senator Short made some reference to other departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite sure that the National Party, through Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Brownhill, who are in here at the moment, would not want you complaining about all of the funds that are collected off taxpayers in cities, et cetera, that go to assisting farmers and other people, and rightly so, I might add. That is something that we support because we have been implementing those sorts of programs. You are not complaining about that. You are not saying the taxpayers in the city would complain about that, because they should not. It is a very fair thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the role of government to ensure that all the changes that are brought about in various places happen.

It is a great reflection of how you would deliver an industrial relations policy if you are lucky enough to ever win government. If you are ever lucky enough to win government, we know exactly what you intend to do. You will probably turn this around to giving employers the whole lot and the unions and employees nothing.</PARA>

You do not want to identify where all the money comes from in that. You deliberately set it up so it cannot be looked at. Why do we not have a good look at that? Senator Ray was right. Why do you not bring that in here and put it on the table so we can have a good look at it? Why do you not bring it in here so we can tell the people of Australia what it is all really about and where the money came for that? That is what you really should do if you are really honest about the system, if you are really serious about uncovering any misuse of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy for the opposition to get up and make these spurious claims about what happens to money and how it is spent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at what has happened in the industrial relations system in this country it becomes clearly evident that all the money that is being spent from the point of view of both the unions' side and the employers' side has seen this country become much more competitive, much more efficient and much more productive. That is something that did not happen under you people for 26 years. For 26 years you did nothing. It is a pathetic effort, Senator Short, to come in here and make the ridiculous sorts of claims that you have made here today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment on the same matter and support Senator Murphy's comments. It is important that we place on the record that what we have seen today is a one-sided representation of the government's encouragement for representatives of employees and employers in this country to improve our industrial relations system, encourage enterprise bargaining and a range of other activities that improve the workplace. These include assistance for migrant workers, learning English on the job and all those sorts of things&mdash;all are represented in the gross figures that have been presented in the parliament quite misleadingly today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the government's efforts in supporting employer organisations in one of my duty electorates. I had the pleasure of presenting grants from the government that were not mentioned earlier today to two employers in the very safe Liberal seat of Forrest: Albany Woollen Mills Ltd and the Bunbury City Council. Both those organisations received grants from this government similar to the ones referred to today to encourage enterprise bargaining within their workplaces. Far from only funding trade unions, we have a very comprehensive and even-handed approach to improving industrial relations and productivity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing the Liberal Party fails to recognise in their comments in debate is that, since early this century, legislation passed by both this parliament and state parliaments has encouraged the development and role of unions of employers and employees in this country. Our whole conciliation and arbitration system has been built upon the recognition of the role that unions of employees and unions of employers play in this country. We have had legislative support for these organisations for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Union Training Authority was established by the Whitlam government but was supported by and expanded under Malcolm Fraser, to his credit, throughout his term of government. We are seeing a really right-wing agenda taking hold over the Liberal Party. It is interesting that the comments made by Senator Short today are based on the Institute of Public Affairs document released a few months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right-wing think tanks are again influencing the Liberal Party to their great detriment. What we are currently seeing in my state of Western Australia is the Liberal Party losing support because of their hard right-wing ideology being reflected in industrial relations legislation. Today we are seeing again an attack on trade unionism in principle. They cannot live with the idea of unionists providing protection to workers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The classic example of that is what happened in relation to minimum wage conditions in Western Australia. Under the previous Labor administration, minimum wages were set within an award context by the industrial commission after it heard argument from the employers and the trade unions about the appropriate minimum wage. Therefore, an independent umpire set that minimum wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing in Western Australia under the Liberal IR policies is that they have given the right to the Liberal industrial relations minister to set minimum wages. He recently got a recommendation from the industrial commission as to what that rate should be. He decided to reduce that recommended increase by 30 per cent. He set the new minimum wage in Western Australia at a lower rate than the one recommended by the industrial commission. He did not have to worry about the influence of unions in the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Deputy President, and I thank Senator Cooney for his usual wisdom. I want to say in this debate that Senator Short has massively understated the nature of the problem. Senator Short, while being robust, has also been, if you like, almost reticent in outlining the full extent of this corrupt practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short only referred to the evident expenditure and donations to the Labor Party for political purposes, when we all know there were other donations. And I refer the Senate, if people have forgotten, to a speech I made last week relating to the Australian Workers Union where $58,000 was transferred from an AWU slush fund in Queensland, I think it was, to the firm of Phillips Fox and Partners, a legal firm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a repayment of a donation by Phillips Fox to a slush fund in the AWU for electoral purposes. I do not know, frankly, whether that was for electoral purposes of a particular faction within the AWU&mdash;it would be a pretty big donation, if it were&mdash;or whether it was a way of getting around the electoral laws and not being revealed. It does seem extraordinary when I look at this list that the only donation I see from the Australian Workers Union to the Labor Party is for $35,144. That seems to me to massively understate the volume of effort and support the AWU put into the Labor Party at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from anything else, there were teams of unionists involved&mdash;I understand, at the expense of the union offices&mdash;in campaigning and printing, delivering and distributing campaign material not only in the workplace but in suburban letterboxes. In other words, the union machine, which involves a large administrative operation, was massively diverted at election time into huge support of the Labor Party. At whose cost? It was a hidden cost. It is not costed or revealed. Yet it was at the cost of the Australian worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I say, apart from any other evidence of hiding this sort of thing, that there is no doubt that Senator Short was significantly understating the financial contribution by the union movement to the Labor Party at the last election, a contribution which was compensated by the government. We see here&mdash;and for example I will pick the AWU&mdash;that the AWU received grants in 1992-93 of $135,000. But it reveals that its involvement in political donations was only $35,144. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Short mentioned in passing, on top of donations and on top of all the work the unions were doing, including printing&mdash;I would like to see those printing bills&mdash;there was specific advertising conducted by the union movement itself. The ACTU, I think Senator Short said, spent over a million dollars. </PARA>

So on top of the evidence here, there is also the direct involvement by way of advertising, which had to be reported, and secret support which must have added up to hundreds of thousands of dollars at the last election by way of printing and so on. In other words, there has been a massive quid pro quo.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the same matter, Madam Deputy President. I am encouraged to rise to my feet because of the invitation from Senator Campbell. I would point out that for many years I was an active officer of the metalworkers union which has, in its rules, provision for a political fund. It is clearly earmarked, and a certain amount of contributions are paid by each member for that very purpose. It is in the balance sheets each year, and it has the full support of probably about 95 per cent of the members of that union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk a little bit about TUTA and the money spent by the government in the training of trade unionists. As would be well known to people in this chamber, and generally in the community, people who work for big business for many years have had the opportunity of training in the areas of economics, human resources and personnel management through university courses that to a great degree were financed by all types of governments from time to time over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade union officials and activists within the trade union movement were never able to take advantage of those particular courses because of their disadvantaged backgrounds or the fact that they had to go to work very early in their working careers&mdash;at 14, 15 or 16 years of age. The unions themselves&mdash;some in particular, and the metalworkers union was an outstanding one&mdash;and the ACTU expended quite a substantial amount of their income to begin the training of activists in the trade union movement. It was obviously seen by the Labor Party and others in the community to be a useful practice because it led to more responsible unionism, it led to people having the ability to negotiate meaningfully, and it did head off many a confrontation in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, with that background, the Labor Party quite correctly&mdash;and Mr Cameron, who was then the minister responsible&mdash;set up TUTA. I have been to TUTA courses on many occasions. On one particular occasion I remember a seminar about how we could enhance industry. </PARA>

I recall that people were invited to that seminar from business&mdash;from Elders and other areas&mdash;and they made a very good contribution. There was a collective approach. It was all intended to create further wealth in the community and thus benefit the whole community. It was intended to establish an opportunity for people to cooperate, for people to be in every way supportive of each other and to head off any type of confrontation. It was also designed to develop the sort of communications that enhance this particular process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone wants to suggest, for instance, that such an activity is not in the interests of the community, or to suggest that all it does is enhance the ability of the trade union movement to confront people in industry and to get higher wages or take some benefit of a selfish nature, then I challenge that, because it was nothing of the sort.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I remind senators, when they make judgments about the relevance of what I have to say, that I spent two days being the subject of nationwide media saturation that I had made death threats against a member of parliament. I would be, as I have earlier said in respect of another document, very disappointed if I thought points of order were going to be taken to prevent my responding to that, however clumsy my presentation might appear to be. I can think of no more foul, vile, unpleasant allegation than that. If there is not some latitude given to allow me to respond that, I am clearly confused about what democracy I am in and what chamber I am in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I was the subject of two days of media saturation, assertions of the nature which I have just outlined. You will recall, Madam Deputy President, that at the time I chose to make no response. I declined to respond in any way on the allegations. Subsequently, I made a brief statement in the Senate denying the claim, and the Australian Federal Police also put out a brief statement denying the assertion. That was only done with grave reluctance by me. I did not want the facts or the reasons for their inquiries to be exposed because it was what one might loosely describe as a covert operation and it was likely to be compromised if I made any statement. So I and my family put up for two days with my being accused of threatening somebody's life because I thought it was more important that the proper processes of investigation be pursued, whatever price I had to pay. I have since been reluctant to make further comment. </PARA>

The Australian Federal Police attended my office on several occasions as a result of a complaint by me. That complaint was that I was subject to what I would euphemistically describe as blackmail.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a point of order. Firstly, Senator Crichton-Browne would make life a lot easier for some of us if he would read the passage that he says includes a misrepresentation and which he says concerns him. He seems reluctant to do that. Secondly, I understood what he was doing was seeking to argue that it was said that he had threatened someone.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it is very serious if it is said that a member of parliament has threatened someone.

This seems to be about the role played by a third party or the conduct of a third party. I am relying on the rather technical point which is that the misrepresentation has not been set out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, it has been claimed by Mr Cameron that the raid on his office was politically motivated as a result of a complaint by me.

But, frankly, we are not here on the debating points; we are here on the facts. I have given you the grounds, and I am arriving at the grounds. I am developing the background for my reluctance thus far to make any public comment about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegation was that the complaint had been made against me. I am correcting that, Senator Hill. You can understand that. I have said the Australian Federal Police attended my office on several occasions as a result of a complaint by me not a complaint against me, Senator Hill, of which you are well familiar. The sections about which I complained were section 28 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, which says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following my complaints, my wife, my staff and I were interviewed on several occasions by members of the Australian Federal Police. In the case of my wife and I, we were interviewed for many hours. My wife, I might tell you, Senator Hill, and I hope you will not take a point of order here, was the recipient of a disgusting and foul letter put into her letterbox without an envelope which my son collected after school. So hurt and humiliated by it was he that he hid it under a tissue box. When his mother got home, and after being terribly agitated for several hours when he should have been doing his homework, he said, `Mum, there is under that tissue box a piece of paper I think you should read.' It was a most disgusting, vile piece of paper written to my wife and stuck in the letterbox deliberately, in my view, intended that my children should read it, otherwise it would have been in an envelope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating the Australian Dairy Corporation's report, I would like to take the opportunity now to say that the actions of the United States government in relation to dairy exports from their country have been a matter of great concern to the dairy industry in this country. Obviously, the Australian Dairy Corporation is, in some respects, at the front line of what the government has done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to say that before the Senate rose for the last recess I made some comments about the dairy industry, in particular the subsidies that the Americans were paying on powdered milk product going from the United States to the Philippines. I said to the Senate that I would be raising that matter on a visit to Washington which was to occur in June-July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel it proper that I take this opportunity to recount the meeting I had at the United States Department of Agriculture. Through the courtesy of the United States Information Service and government officials in the United States I had the opportunity to meet with the senior official in the United States Department of Agriculture who is responsible for the allocation of export enhancement program subsidies for agricultural exports. The farm bill sets out a certain amount of money available to EEP. This official and his assistants allocate that portion of the farm bill to particular subsidies on particular products in particular markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was appropriate to raise that subject with him and to say, as I hope honourable senators from both sides of the chamber would say, that it is not satisfactory that these subsidies are used to corrupt an otherwise incorrupt market. The response from the Department of Agriculture was as follows: `It is only 3,000 tons of powdered milk product.' They did not believe that had the effect of corrupting the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may be the honestly held view of the United States Department of Agriculture. It should be a matter of record that that is not the honestly held view of the Australian dairy industry. Subsidies of this nature undermine the integrity of free trade in agricultural products. Subsidies of this nature destroy the fair market price, in this case for powdered milk products in the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After an enormous amount of discussion&mdash;the argument went on for about 20 minutes&mdash;the official in question was forced to concede that every time the United States uses EEP subsidies there are some winners and there are some losers. He concluded that obviously in this case Australia was the loser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an important concession, for the simple reason that hitherto United States trade policy has been predicated, at least in so far as EEP is concerned, on the basis that these subsidies are not intended to corrupt the international market but are intended to protect the international market. The argument that the American government has advanced hitherto has been that these subsidies are used only when the European Community subsidises similar product into that market. The subsidy is designed to neutralise the advantage to the Europeans of their subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case they indicated that we were the losers, not the Europeans. They indicated that Australia was the loser under that subsidy. That should be a matter of great concern. It is also a matter that everybody in primary industry should note. Deep in their hearts the American government must know that what they are doing is damaging to us. I renew the appeal I made there and then that these subsidies should stop because they are damaging the trade of friends of the United States. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the last report of the Horticultural Policy Council. The Horticultural Policy Council has been succeeded by an organisation known as Horticulture 2000 Group, which I chair. The Horticultural Policy Council has had a couple of priorities while it has been in existence over the last five or six years. One of those priorities was to bring about the establishment of a peak body representing horticultural producers in this country. Secondly, the council has been responsible for stimulating debate about a range of policy matters relating to horticultural industries in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the policy council succeeded very well in the second of those objectives. Over the last few years, it has commissioned a number of reports which deal with fostering particularly the export development of horticultural industries. There are over 100 horticultural industries in this country, ranging from bananas, to citrus, to apples and to walnuts. A number of those industries are sunrise industries, new industries, where a number of critical issues&mdash;such as research and development, processing and marketing&mdash;are very important in the early stages of development of those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The horticultural industries have been traditionally largely domestically oriented, but a significant change is occurring in that they are now searching for international markets, particularly in Asia. A number of the reports that the Horticultural Policy Council commissioned have stimulated debate not just in the horticultural sector but in the broader agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Horticultural Policy Council sits along with the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, another organisation that this government established, that is funded dollar for dollar of R&amp;D for the various horticultural industries. That organisation began in 1988, I think, with quite small funding of $1 million. It is now $15 million or $16 million a year. So it is providing a significant research element in the horticultural sector. We also have the Australian Horticultural Corporation, which is primarily concerned with promotional and marketing type activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to place on record the government's appreciation to John Pendrigh, the Chairman of the Horticultural Policy Council. John recognised that the first of its goals that I have mentioned here today&mdash;the creation of a peak industry body for horticultural producers in this country&mdash;was a very difficult goal to attain. Horticulture is characterised by over 100 different industry segments that are very decentralised with tens of thousands of producers. It is not easy to activate an industry organisation to represent horticultural growers in this country. I know that John Pendrigh and the other members of the Horticultural Policy Council came to the conclusion that that task&mdash;despite a significant number of seminars and conferences around the country at both national and regional levels&mdash;was, to some extent, beyond them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council took a view that, with the creation of Horticulture 2000 by this government, the ongoing stimulation and development of policy could be well handled by Horticulture 2000 and that the Horticultural Policy Council should therefore cease to exist. That is why the report before the Senate is the council's last report. I would like to place on record my thanks particularly to the chair, John Pendrigh. John has been involved in a number of other primary industry activities for this government. He is a man of wide respect and deep experience in the wine industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Meat Research Corporation states that the goal of the Japan-Korea markets key program was `to enhance the ability of producers and processors to maximise benefits from the expanding beef markets in Japan and Korea'. Last year when I was on a delegation in Japan and Korea, we saw how the Aussie beef program was going. We picked up one piece of beef one day and had a look at it and it had `Aussie beef' on it. I was expecting to see `Product of Australia', but I saw on it `Product of the United States of America', and I made mention of it in this place. That is how successful the program was. Unfortunately, the Americans were using it, and they have actually used it to good effect, because they have increased market share in Japan and have done a very good job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Meat Research Corporation makes the point that the market development key program goal is this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To secure and strengthen current market positions by developing marketing and access strategies which are better than those of our competitors. These strategies have the potential to increase industry gross values of production by up to $1 billion by the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA>I notice that in the report under the heading `Input requirements for the cattle feedlot industry'&mdash;and they are very big&mdash;there are some very good figures on the number of cattle that were grain fed in Australia in 1994. The domestic figure was something like 1.2 million, and the export figure was just under 800,000&mdash;a total of two million-plus. The optimistic estimates are that in the year 2002 there will be something like 2.6 million grain fed cattle. The pessimistic estimates are that there are not going to be many more than there are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of grain used to feed cattle, of course, is very important to the grain producers in Australia, because it is a wonderful value adding product when export beef goes through the feedlot industry in Australia, and the best estimate is that about 1.6 million tonnes will be used in the year 2002. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of concern to me in this report, which is very well laid out, is the foot and mouth disease status of some of the countries of Latin America, and that is what we have to look out for as beef producers. We have to be competitive, and I will make some points about our competitiveness in a moment. Uruguay is expected to soon be free of foot and mouth disease. The Mesopotamia area of Argentina is expected to be free between 1997 and the year 2000. Paraguay is expected to be free in the year 2005. And Brazil is expected to be free between the years 1997 and 2000. Brazil has something like 144 million cattle, mostly Nellore, so it is going to be a very big competitor with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we have as beef producers in Australia, which brings me to the point of the input costs, is that we have a government at the moment that has actually paid lip-service to all our export industries. One of the points that has been made in this report is about the technical barriers to trade, including meat inspection requirements. We all know about that; we are having an inquiry at the moment into the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The report talks about the problems with hormonal growth promotants and the minimum residue levels, with which we have just recently had a big problem with helix into Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that is really going to make a big difference to beef producers in the future is our competitiveness. The Keating Labor government have not done anything to make us competitive as far as waterfront charges are concerned; they have not made us competitive with our transport costs in Australia. Our transport costs really have a big impact on beef producers. We have wholesale taxes, fuel excise and those sorts of things. Onto the farm and off the farm transport costs are always very big. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have the capital gains tax on us as beef producers&mdash;de facto death duties. Inflation costs have gone up more than the government thought and more than their good friend Bernie Fraser at the Reserve Bank thought. That is going to make all the input costs to our farming, especially to our beef producers, so much more difficult to bear in the future. It is not going to keep us as a competitive nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealanders are doing us like a dinner as far as competitiveness with beef exports into Japan and Korea are concerned. If we are going to be competitive, we have to get those things right. Basically, we have to have our transport costs and our waterfront fixed up so we can compete with the rest of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation was given a difficult task by the government and it has done a good job. It was given a huge debt&mdash;a pea and thimble trick&mdash;in the Federal Airports Corporation and told to be commercial. Over the time it has done an excellent job with millions of dollars worth of expansions&mdash;the most recent being Brisbane's international airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times the minister for disasters, the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, has called down his wrath on what was a good organisation. The former Managing Director, Mr Bill Swingler, left on 31 July 1995; the reason being the minister took away from the FAC the right to charge at airports. Notwithstanding the debt and the job they did, the landing charges in Australia were among the lowest in the world. He decided to take that away so Mr Swingler came to the conclusion that he did not have much of a role left. </PARA>

Except for two years, his entire career has been in the trade union movement. He has been put on the board of the Federal Airports Corporation. What are his qualifications?

The sale of the lease of these two airports, not the freehold sale, will take place some time in the next couple of years. It will certainly take place upon this government's return.

<PARA>I am conscious of the time. We are to move on to a debate about minimum wages shortly. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Industrial Registry report are very important. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is one of the most important institutions in this country. Why is it so important? It is important because, unlike most other countries in the Western world, including most countries around the world, we have an independent arbitration system which determines, through awards, minimum wages and conditions for workers throughout the country, certainly in the federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important safety nets of our social fabric, including Medicare and superannuation, in addition to the sorts of policies that I have mentioned that this government implemented, has been the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about awards, arbitrated and determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, is that they protect workers who are not in a strong bargaining position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The advertisement in Western Australia is a continuation of the beat-up that has seen the misleading and scaremongering tactics that were perpetrated at the last election on the Australian people. Mr Keating survived because of the perpetuation of that lie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my time today I want to demonstrate how in many instances employees do better under Liberal than they do under Labor, both under the state systems and under the federal system. I want to deal firstly with the situation which has existed in Western Australia for many years with regard to the minimum rates of pay under both Liberal and Labor governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far back as I can remember&mdash;I have not gone back to the day dot&mdash;there has been a minimum rate of pay in Western Australia. During the period of the last Labor government in Western Australia, the minimum rate of pay fell gradually in real terms. From when Premier Brian Burke came to office it fell from $327.50 in real terms to $300.25 in real terms when Lawrence lost government. There were some variations, but I am not going to go through every detail. Seeing as the children were brought into this debate by the previous speaker, I make the point that it was under Sir Charles Court when he was Premier of Western Australia back in 1981 that equal pay was granted to men and women. It is very interesting that equal pay was granted to males and females in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now look at the situation which has exised since the so-called Court wave of industrial relations. For the first time in five years there has been an increase in real terms in the minimum wage. It has increased in real terms by $17 to the current figure of $317.10. I think that shows fairly clearly the direction that minimum wages have taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I must make&mdash;which is not consistent with the other states&mdash;is that this gives protection right across the board. It gives protection to those who are under awards if their awards have not been adjusted upwards. It gives protection to those who wish to go into an agreement. It also gives protection to those who have no award or agreement coverage. Western Australia is the only state that does that. It is worth looking at that particular aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night we heard a contribution from Senator Chris Evans. I want to comment on a couple of aspects of his speech because he was wrong in so many areas. He said that employees had the protection of everything in awards under the federal system but they do not have it in Western Australia. Under the Western Australian legislation employees have the option of staying within the Western Australian award or going out. There is a duress clause included. When Senator Sherry was in the chamber I sought leave to have this duress clause incorporated. It is a very strict clause. People on the other side of the chamber should take note of it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to move to that part of the motion which deals with a series of federal awards which are under the direct responsibility of the Keating government. These awards are significantly below the Western Australian minimum. From the research we have done in the last few days we have discovered that the 1993 commercial industrial artists federal award has two classifications out of 10 that are under the Western Australian state minimum. We discovered that five out of five junior rates are under the Western Australian junior rates minimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the licensed clubs managers and secretaries federal award we find that two out of seven classifications are under the Western Australian minimum. In the assistant managerial staff award we find that six out of seven are under the Western Australian minimum. And so we go on. We come to the squash court industry interim award, the theatrical employees federal award and the tenpin bowling industry award. I sought leave from Senator Sherry to table these particular awards so that people can see them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the classifications in those awards we find that 50 out of 84 have adult rates below the Western Australian minimum. I find that absolutely remarkable when we hear the nonsense that is being pedalled on the other side of the chamber and which has been put out in Western Australia. These awards are significantly below those of Western Australia. If these people were under state awards the rate of pay would have to be increased to the minimum established under the Western Australian legislation. This points out very clearly that in many areas the rates of pay to individuals under federal awards are significantly lower than those in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote a few awards to put them on the public record, but I will seek leave in a moment to table these various awards. Let us take the squash court industry interim federal award. For the first classification, the federal award is $260.60 per week, versus the WA minimum of $317.10. If we go a little bit further down the table, we find $266.50 versus $317.10. One would wonder why this federal government does not like theatrical employees. Listed under theatrical employees we find Bibra Lakes Adventure World, which is worth visiting. It is a very nice place; I would commend it to anyone in this chamber. For Adventure World, which is under the federal award, we find 11 out of 11 sit in a classification on $288.15, versus the minimum rate of $317.10. One can go on working these things through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this does is expose the lie that has been perpetrated on the Australian people in that Labor supposedly creates a situation where people get better wages under them than they do under the Liberal Party. I now seek leave to table those awards that I have made reference to, which I cleared with Senator Sherry earlier in the day. </PARA>

Mr Brereton also said yesterday that the unions and employer organistions were going to take out that particular clause and that it had been dead for 25 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put the proposition: if it has been dead for 25 years, why has it been adjusted twice in recent times? It was adjusted in December 1993 and September 1994. It is a living, breathing, working clause in that award. It has been adjusted upwards by the arbitration commission. The question we have to put as far as the statement that it is going to be removed is concerned is: what are they going to put in its place? That is what we want to know. I hope that when the speakers on the other side of this chamber get their chance to speak on this, they will tell us what they are going to put in its place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to come to in the time I have left is the WA situation. Under the WA system there is a choice&mdash;the award or go into an agreement. There is a duress clause, which I made reference to before. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I make deals with Queensland. It is very interesting when we look at what was said about Queensland the other day by Mr Brereton. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The award rates paid to employees include a margin on top of Mr Reith's $250. I am advised by the DIR that not only are there no full-time adult award employees in Queensland being paid $250 per week but also it is impossible to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brereton was right, by six days. The rate was moved to above $250 on 20 October 1995. It was gazetted on that date. It was a $6.40 increase and it took the award rate to $250.30. This is under the state station hands award.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I said that in Queensland they were $67 worse off than in Western Australia, I was wrong. They were $66.70 worse off under this minimum award rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many federal awards that are under the Western Australian award. There is a duress clause and there are minimum conditions in Western Australia. I emphasise that. Minimum conditions do not exist in Queensland.

Senator Crane knows that I have had experience in this area for some years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind Senator Crane of some of the facts rather than the distortions we are getting on award rates of pay under the federal system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come in here and suggest that the $246.10 rate per clause 9 of the metal industry award is a real rate of pay that exists in the metal industry is wrong. It demonstrates that you have forgotten anything you knew or are deliberately forgetting anything you knew about the process of minimum rates adjustment under the Accord or through the federal Industrial Relations Commission and the process of establishing supplementary payments. I am sure you remember these things. You were involved in some of those proceedings. I will come back to that in a little while. That was when you were in the pastoral industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum rate under the metal industry award is $341.40. That is the base rate, plus the supplementary payment, plus the safety net adjustment. That rate is an entry level rate. It has application to very few people. When people with little or no qualifications or experience come into the industry, they start on that rate. They pretty quickly move up through the classification structure to the higher rates, generally after three to six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you understand anything about the way the federal award system operates, about how supplementary payments were introduced into federal awards and how awards were reconstructed by broadbanding classifications to base them on skill rather than on strict demarcation lines, you will understand that even that rate of $341.40 is a very bare minimum. In fact, people in the industry were getting paid well in excess of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the supplementary payments were introduced into federal awards some years ago, what actually happened was that this produced some of the biggest wage increases for workers on minimum rates in this country that we have ever seen. People in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, people in the hospitality and hotels industry under federal awards, people in the rural industry, people in small manufacturing industries all received huge increases because of the introduction of supplementary payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process was actually called the minimum rates adjustment process. It was endorsed by the federal commission whereby there would be adjustments to federal awards&mdash;particularly those for low income workers, people on low minimum rates of pay&mdash;to bring their award rates of pay up to more reasonable levels. It was particularly targeted at those people working in industries with little industrial clout that did not have the industrial strength or capacity that people in other industries may have had to go out and bargain for over-award payments. That is what this debate is very much about: it is about providing through an award system protection for people who are at the lower end of the income scale in terms of award coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Nevertheless, the point is that the figures quoted and used by Senator Crane and others on the opposition side are completely and utterly false. It is a deliberate distortion to use that rate, and Senator Jacinta Collins will take that issue up in her contribution. What also has to be remembered in this process is that award rates of pay are not set by trade unions and are not set by federal or state Labor governments; award rates of pay are set by the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who have done most to oppose any increases for low income workers over the years are those people sitting on the opposite side of the chamber; those opposite whose colleagues out there in the employer organisations have, on every single occasion bar the last couple, opposed national wage increases. When the commission awarded an $8, $10 or $12 wage increase or a two per cent wage increase, it did so after hearing opposition to those increases from the employer ranks and from the coalition parties. You are the people who have constantly argued throughout the 1980s and the 1990s that low income workers should not get any national wage increases at all; yet you have the hide to come in here and say, `Look at these rates, they're too low.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to acknowledge one thing: I would like to see the minimum rates in federal awards higher than what they are. They are certainly a lot higher than the figures you quote, Senator Crane. I would like to see them higher because I think that these workers deserve more. But, ultimately, that is dependent upon decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now you have the hide to come in here and lecture us about minimum rates of pay. What effrontery! What hypocrisy! When you look at federal awards, you do not just look at the award rates of pay. You have to look at all the other conditions that are in there, such as the annual leave, the annual leave loading, the sick leave, the penalty rates, the overtime and the superannuation&mdash;that great achievement promoted by this government and endorsed by the Industrial Relations Commission against the opposition of the coalition parties and some major employer organisations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are all the other elements of federal awards that increase the package for the worker, but they are the elements that the opposition wants to get rid of.

For a start, it is 30 per cent lower than the figure that was recommended to the minister by an independent expert.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then also have to look at other matters in relation to the income levels for Australian families, to go to the specific terms of this motion regarding how people can survive on award rates of pay. It is difficult for people to survive on low minimum award rates of pay. I will grant that. As I said, those award rates of pay are set by the commission after hearing argument from the employers and the unions. It is the employers in there who are arguing to keep those rates low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anybody is responsible for low minimum rates of pay in this country, it is you lot. You are the ones who oppose them all the time. That is why the government has moved to boost the social wage. That is why we have established the family payment supplement. The family payment supplement, paid to low income earners, can provide up to an additional $94 per fortnight to a family with two children. That represents about $130 in wages&mdash;$94 in real terms. That goes onto the minimum award rates of pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are the other benefits like the parenting allowance, which is now paid directly to the mothers. There is the child-care subsidy, and there is the Austudy payment that families are assisted by. There is the maternity allowance, recently introduced by the government in the latest budget, which is about $816 upon the birth of a child. And, of course, there is Medicare: one of the greatest social reforms of this country that helps the battlers and provides them with a decent standard of health care&mdash;something that you people in the past have been committed to destroying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you add all of those things in. You have to add those things in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what he forgot to tell us was the situation of the lowly paid farmers at that time. In many instances, they were loss making farmers who clearly could not afford to pay any more in wages at that time and who, because of the abuse of union power by the likes of Senator Forshaw and his mates, in the end were forced to increase wages despite the fact that they could not afford to pay them. This is what we see from the Labor Party side.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's current story on industrial relations is certainly a huge lie as Senator Crane has pointed out in this motion. The statutory minimum wage of $317.10 in Western Australia is $67 higher than the minimum $250 for an adult apprentice under the metal trades industry award in Queensland, which is set by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission under the Goss Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia, the equivalent adult minimum wage paid to an adult apprentice who has not worked in the industry prior to apprenticeship and which would apply to a first or perhaps second year adult apprentices is $238.10 under a federal award. This notice of motion seeks condemnation on the government for its untrue scare campaign in relation to these matters, particularly in relation to Western Australia, and asks the government to explain how a family in Queensland earning the minimum wage can survive on $67 per week less than the minimum in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could also ask the government to explain how a family in South Australia earning the minimum federal award wage can survive on $79 less than that which is the minimum in Western Australia and even $12 less than the Queensland minimum wage. This is under a federal award. It was admitted on ABC radio yesterday that some two per cent of the Queensland working population are actually earning that $250 a week minimum. How many people that actually represents, I do not know. This government takes the cake when it comes to the big ask for requiring Australian families to live on inadequate incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have more than half a million children in Australia aged up to 14 years in families with incomes below the poverty line.

They have an entitlement to bereavement leave and nothing else. There are no penalty rates, overtime provisions, holiday loadings or annual leave or sick leave entitlements. There is just a casual hourly rate of $9.10. Tell me this: how will the disadvantage test protect those people? It will not, because it is not based on a real base. </PARA>

They have chosen this sort of smokescreen approach and to say, `Under you people, Australian workers' wages have actually gone backwards.' The reality is that they have increased by seven per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You said, `Our position has changed.' I thought, `I'll give you people a bit of a go here.' So I looked to Mr Reith and to what he has said on a few occasions. I will quote him on how he sees employment contracts. Laurie Oakes asks:</PARA>

<PARA>I know Senator O'Chee seems to have all of the knowledge&mdash;he is the repository of all wisdom&mdash;but I do not know how you lower the cost of production without actually cutting wages. Productivity under this government has improved out of sight. For 26 years this country had a coalition government, and productivity went backwards. If you really are going to lift productivity in this country, you better tell people how you are going to do it and, at the same time, meet the claim of huge wage increases that you are making to them. I am quite sure a lot of employers would be very interested to see how these people are going to do that as well. In terms of unfair dismissal, Mr Reith says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, we'd abolish the court. We would also reinstate effective secondary boycott provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the hypocrisy in the opposition's argument with regard to industrial relations. You say that you are the workers' friend.

<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, but that obviously is going to change over time as the nature of awards change.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national director of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, Father David Cappo, has described many of the industrial relations principles espoused by the Federal Coalition as `good and just', saying that the Commission would be prepared to work with the Coalition towards ensuring that the principles were developed into concrete policies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is worth while coming back to Senator Crane's motion before the Senate and restating what the government missed in the debate and failed to address. Senator Crane notes that when the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) was launching the very misleading advertisements in Western Australia he said that the Court Liberal government had set the minimum weekly wage at $317.10. He failed to add that when the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was Premier of Western Australia between 1991 and 1992 the minimum weekly wage was $268.80; and, further, that wage rates in a series of federal awards which are under the direct responsibility of the Keating government are significantly below the Western Australian state minimum. That is what we are debating today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support my colleagues on this motion because, in essence, it goes to the heart of the government's utter misrepresentation of the coalition's industrial relations intentions. The government has been desperate to whip up some sort of fear campaign in Western Australia in the same way as the Queensland Goss government did at the last Queensland election. That attempt fell flat. The federal government has been desperate to peg back the gap in the polls before Christmas. The government knows that if the gap in the polls holds until Christmas it is finished as a government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As evidence of the failure of that Western Australian blockade, there was nothing more pitiful than the most pathetic address of the head of the ACTU, Jennie George, before only 200 demonstrators on the day of the blockade. I think that said it all. The workers did not come out to support the union- and government-led blockade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it little wonder that union membership is at crisis level? It is now only 35 per cent of the work force. If you take out the Public Service&mdash;some 60 per cent of the Public Service is unionised&mdash;only 25 per cent of workers in this country are members of a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You only have to look at the Asahi case as evidence that the non-union workers of Australia really do want to have the opportunity to negotiate directly with their employers. The unions should know that one of the main reasons they have had such a fall in union membership is that Australian workers feel so alienated from their union heads and bosses. They feel left out of any of the benefits that the union bosses seem to be getting. Many of them happen to get the benefits of a term in the parliament, jobs on government boards or direct grants to their union offices. There have been some $100 million in direct grants to unions by this government in the last 10 or so years&mdash;$16 million in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look to the last week or two to see one of the best reasons workers feel so alienated from their unions. That came from one of the most prominent union bosses, Mr Bill Kelty. The integrity of the union superannuation funds was put at risk because Mr Bill Kelty sought to intimidate, if not blackmail, the AMP Society with regard to union superannuation funds. It had nothing to do with the daily lives of the workers; it had nothing to do with their welfare. It had more to do with the board dispute at Coles Myer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the first mistakes of the union movement were made in around 1987 when they started to introduce the plan to reconstruct the unions to the point where they would have only some 20 major unions. That was a Kelty plan also, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Future strategies for the trade union movement</EMPHASIS>. I think that went hand in hand with another document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>. The government gave them some $40 million to introduce that plan for superunions. History shows that that has been an utter failure because it has further alienated workers. In fact, the amalgamation of many of these unions has really been not to the benefit of the workers or for the care of the workers but for simple power plays and factional plays within the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workers feel even more alienated when they see the stronger unions that have come about because of these amalgamations, like the Transport Workers Union. They have been able to grab greater pay rises outside the government's much-loved Accord. The Transport Workers Union recently won a 15 per cent pay rise. This has had a cascading effect on workers in other industries. In fact, it has put them at a great disadvantage. In many respects, a protection racket is being run where the big, powerful unions are able to use their muscle to get huge pay rises to the detriment of workers in other industries. All of these costs, particularly in the Transport Workers Union, cascade throughout the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same is true for the Western Australian blockade. It never related to jobs or the welfare of the workers. It simply related to the empowering of the union. In fact, the industrial relations reforms brought in by the Court government had more to do with empowering the workers, if you look at some of the proposed changes, such as a form of secret ballots. That point, I hear today, is under negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another proposed change is that workers will have the right to prevent expenditure of their membership fees on political donations. Why shouldn't they have that choice? It will be only a choice as they see fit. Employees can nominate their own superannuation fund, and union officials must adopt modern principles of financial accounting. What is wrong with that? Because it is all for the benefit of the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This pattern of government interference in the industrial relations of this country and union bosses getting together, as they have in Western Australia, has flowed through to the Tweed Valley case, a well-known and publicised case. In this case, workers have successfully negotiated with their employer, on a one-on-one basis, to cash out their sick leave. I believe they did not cash out all their sick leave; it was only half or some three or four days&mdash;just a part of their sick leave entitlements. When you look at the details of this case, you will find that they were allowed to take the full sick leave, but some of the days were not on pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because they were not taking their whole sick leave throughout the year, the workers decided to trade that off and to cash it out to have the advantage of something they were not receiving anyway. The government happened to think that was a very stupid idea. It treated the workers as if they were stupid and that they needed the union to tell them otherwise. This was the very basis of Labor's approach to the Tweed Valley case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did not think the workers were bright enough to make their own decision. The example of this is on 26 September, when the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, Gary Johns, said on TV that the Tweed Valley workers `traded away their right to sickness leave. That's a stupidity. They shouldn't be doing that'. If they shouldn't be doing that, why hasn't the government interfered in other examples of enterprise bargaining where similar circumstances have arisen? The reason is that the Tweed Valley case was a political move by the government to try to highlight a fear campaign against the industrial relations intentions of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just so happens that those workers lost out where others haven't who have done the same thing because we are running close to an election and because this government now has become so desperate. There are several examples where sick leave has been traded out, as it has been in the Tweed Valley case. There are other examples, such as in meat workers union, where the government has interfered of late simply to beat up some sort&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to draw the attention of the Senate and of this nation to the terrible plight of the long-term unemployed in this country. Today Senator Troeth and I, along with a number of other colleagues, planned to speak on this matter in a matter of public importance which, because of procedures of the Senate, did not come on this afternoon. I would just like to read what that matter of public importance was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appalling and entrenched levels of long-term unemployment and the failure of the Keating government to address this scourge that is crippling Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have, and what I would like to draw to people's attention, is a government here which is covering up what is happening with unemployment in this country, particularly the plight of the long-term unemployed. It is only when you have bodies like Senate committees that delve into matters in great depth do you find out what is really happening in this society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such an opportunity came to the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee when we conducted a series of hearings into long-term unemployment right around Australia. We had witnesses in every state and major regional areas of Australia that told us the real story about unemployment in this country which is at incredibly high levels. Don't believe the official rate: you have to more than double the official rate to get to the real rate of unemployment in this country. In reality, back in the depths of our recent recession, we had more than 20 per cent of the country unemployed&mdash;not only registered people but also people who were underemployed. In other words, they worked one or two days a week and still could not find enough work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of this whole group, the greatest concern should be about the long-term unemployed, whose numbers have risen over the last 10 years to almost 30 per cent of the total unemployed in this country. This is a matter of enormous concern about which the committee took evidence right around the country. I would just like to provide the Senate with some of the flavour of what is going on out there. Witnesses before us made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel abandoned by the system . . . exploited by the system&mdash;abused by the system&mdash;and held captive by the system.</PARA>
<PARA>In an area like Whyalla, people told us this: `We are sick and tired of training for training sake. We are disillusioned with training programs that are getting us nowhere.' Another witness said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . participants in work experience programs . . . after six months of feeling really happy and that they are up and going, all of a sudden their placement ends . . . are dead in their tracks . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is probably the most tragic comment of all:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is more comfortable to remain lying in the gutter than to be picked up and dropped back in it again. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the despair that is out there with the long-term unemployed people. What our committee did manage to uncover was the way in which this government is covering up the extent of the problem. That is of tremendous danger to our society, because if we hide this problem then the people in the community are going to think, `Well, it's not such a problem,' and therefore public policy will not be directed towards them. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have developing in this country is a major underclass of people who have not had any work and do not have any prospect of having any work. There are in some areas of Australia up to three generations of people now who have never worked. That is a disgrace and a condemnation of this government's record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has the government done about it? Yesterday, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, came out and tried to tell us how well his programs under Working Nation were working. He was basing this on a report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Unfortunately, Senator Schacht, who answered my question in the Senate today, had not even bothered to look at this report and certainly had not even bothered to look at the minister's propaganda on this matter&mdash;at least he might have repeated that but he did not even do that. Let me read from the department's report how it says its programs are working, and I will read between the lines for you and tell you what it is really saying. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a jobs compact and most people realise this is aimed at guaranteeing training and/or work to the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>How many people are in this jobs compact? The report says that there was a fall in the number of jobs compact clients from more than 300,000 in July 1994 to 275,800 in July 1995. What a marvellous drop that is! I remind people that the height of the boom was from mid-1994 to mid-1995. During this boom they managed to get the figure down by 24,000 people&mdash;that is, less than 10 per cent&mdash;and they are trying to say that this was a great success!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the government's programs and strategies is case management. Let us look at how successful case management is. They were supposed to be moving a lot of case management into private contracting, to Employment Assistance Australia. How well has that been going over this period? There were 376,000 clients entering case management and 347,000 of those were with Employment Assistance Australia, which is the government body. The contracted case managers had only 29,500, according to that government report, which is less than 10 per cent. If you work that out across the whole of Australia by electorate, you find it is a minuscule number of people who have been put into this private case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major criticisms of our committee was the way in which the government was supposed to be implementing Working Nation and that is reflected in these figures. It is incredibly slow to get things under way. The government set up this program to solve the problems of the long-term unemployed that came out of the last recession. At the speed they are travelling with this, we will be into the next recession before anything starts to happen. Yet yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was trying to say, and it is in the press today, how marvellous it is. Let us listen to what Simon Crean had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its first year of operation, Working Nation has achieved very significant results and has established the framework for further substantial achievements. . . </PARA>
<PARA>What nonsense. That is not the case. That is not what his own department says. It is certainly not what we found out when we had our major inquiry. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of Working Nation, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate had declined to 8.3 per cent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about June 1995. I have news for the minister. The figures are out for this month and it is not June. It is now October and the figure is on the rise. Unemployment is on the rise in this country. And today we found out that inflation is on the rise. What we have is the double whammy, the double loss, which is rising inflation and rising unemployment. That is the real picture of what is happening in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not put in place programs to solve this problem. What they have done is called churning the dole queue. What that means, under its Working Nation program, is that people receive training and that is often combined with employment, which in principle is a good idea, but under the government training program this only works for six months. What happens at the end of six months? Our inquiry found that half of them do not get a job. What happens to that half? What happens is that they go back not onto the long-term list where they might have been for a few years with a whole lot of extra benefits and assistance but to the start of the queue. Those people have to wait for months to get any assistance. That is one of the major tragedies of the government's program. People whose self-esteem has risen lose that, and because they do not have the opportunities, they are less employable. That is one of the most negative outcomes of Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people who are in that situation are taken off the long-term list. The government is trying to make out how fast long-term unemployment is coming down. A lot of it, as I indicated, is the churning of the queue. It is the failure of Working Nation. I am glad that the Senate now has a report which tells the true story to the people of Australia&mdash;that Working Nation is not working. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three matters I want to address in the adjournment debate tonight. Firstly, I want to follow up on comments I made on Tuesday night of this week in the adjournment debate, when I got up and defended the Governor-General, His Excellency Bill Hayden, from some pretty severe attacks that were happening in sections of our media. I said this on that occasion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I contend in this place and will contend publicly that whatever any public figure does when that public figure is on holidays is that individual's own business. If they choose to go off to Banff in Canada and have a relaxing holiday and stay at hotels reported to cost 1,500 bucks a night, that is their business; it is nobody else's business.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would defend the Governor-General's right to move to Vancouver, as was reported in the same paper on Monday of this week. He is reported to have stayed at a hotel in Vancouver costing $1,350 per night. The Governor-General, Mr Hayden, is reported to have said that he got that hotel for $800 a night. Good on him. If it saves him a quid, I am all for that too. I reiterate: it is nobody else's business what he does when he is on holiday.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the comments that are on the public record. It has been brought to my attention that it is our business, indeed everybody's business, what has gone on in Banff and Vancouver. It has been put to me that the bills that I have spoken about are, in fact, being picked up by the taxpayers of Australia. I have not immediately accepted those assertions. I have sought, by contacting the Governor-General's office, to get clarification of whether or not the taxpayers, through the credit cards issued at Government House, are paying for His Excellency Mr Hayden and his wife whilst they are on holidays in Canada. To date, I have not had a response to the query that went over to Government House yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, in the next two weeks, the inquiry comes back and what has been put to me is confirmed&mdash;that, indeed, the taxpayers are paying these bills&mdash;I will, when this parliament returns or possibly even before it returns, during estimates committees, be asking that His Excellency pay those, what I consider to be, personal bills out of his own personal account. I do not think the taxpayers of Australia should pay for the holidays of governors-general or parliamentarians. I would hope that what I have been told since is not the case and, if it is the case, I hope it would be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I want to address is a matter of some good news and emanates from a memorandum of understanding which was signed between Australia and China on 25 January this year. Under the terms of that MOU, China agreed to the return and the continued protection of Sino-Vietnamese boat people who could confirm that they had been resettled as refugees in China after fleeing Vietnam in the 1970s and early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 800 people arrived illegally in Australia late last year and early this year. I am very pleased to report to the Senate that this morning a seventh group&mdash;this time of 96 people who were covered by the MOU, and the largest group so far&mdash;flew out of Port Hedland bound for Nanning in southern China. They had arrived in Australia between November last year and March this year in six boats codenamed the Brolga, the Galah, the Heron, the Jabiru, the Kookaburra and the Nightingale. As was the case with all previous six departures, this flight left without incident, and arrangements have been made in China for their safe arrival. This latest flight brings to 465 the number of people returned under the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to tempt fate by commending the fact that, since the first return of people back to China in May of this year, no other boats from that part of the world carrying illegals into Australia have descended on our shores. I hope I do not live to regret the recognition of that fact, but a fact indeed it is. Certainly that fact has something to do with the fact that we are returning people who arrive illegally on our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The third matter that I want to address tonight relates to the locale where I will be tomorrow night: it is indeed wonderful Wanneroo in Western Australia. I want to refer to the editorial that appeared in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper last Friday, 20 October. It was headed `Open up on Wanneroo, Mr Court'. I want to quote a small part of that editorial. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Openness and accountability seem to have become hollow words for the Court Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although ministers are fond of bandying them about, they show no commitment to the principles the words convey. If they did, they would insist that the inquiry into what has become known as Wanneroo Inc was carried out with the full powers and privileges of a royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Richard Court's rearguard action against moves to open the Kyle inquiry into the Wanneroo City Council can only reinforce the community perception that the Government has something to hide.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps what the government is seeking to hide is the matter contained under a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of yesterday, 25 October, entitled `Police told of $30,000 Wanneroo gift: MP'. The article commenced:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police have been told that the West Australian Attorney-General, Ms Edwardes, received $30,000 in political donations from a corrupt mayor, the State Parliament was told yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Edwardes is reported in the body of the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, I am not aware of those allegations. I am aware though that Dr Bradshaw&mdash;</PARA>

She has vigorously and quite properly denied any wrongdoing or receiving gifts of the nature outlined by Senator McKiernan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to comment on the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee's long-term unemployment report which was released today and the government claim in their more recent publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shaping the nation</EMPHASIS> that Australia is leading the OECD in the generation of new jobs. In the report that was released today we were reminded that the unemployment rate in Australia was two per cent higher than the OECD average for the period 1973 to 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that since April 1993 employment growth has led to 670,000 new jobs. In fact, the recent recession destroyed 337,300 jobs, and the number of unemployed people still exceeds the worst figures at the peak of the recession in the early 1980s. The incidence of long-term unemployment at 30 per cent in Australia is much worse than the rate of approximately 15 per cent in Japan and 12 per cent in the United States. So the government's claim that its programs are having a significant impact is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week's ABS figures showed that long-term unemployment had increased in the previous month, up 6,600 to a total of 237,700, and long-term unemployment as a proportion of total unemployment rose from 30.7 per cent to 31.1 per cent. Unemployment is unwelcome, whatever its duration, but long-term unemployment has particularly disturbing ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report by the Brotherhood of St Laurence entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Unequal lives&mdash;low income and the life chances of three year olds</EMPHASIS> talks about the growing divide between those families with children who have no parent in paid work and those who have two parents in a job. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long term this polarisation has the potential to produce markedly unequal life chances for children and reduce social cohesion.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian studies show that there is a relationship between low parental income, a low level of educational attainment and long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brotherhood of St Laurence report showed some disturbing detrimental effects on children brought up in low income families. They were more likely to have their health rated as fair rather than excellent by their mothers; they were more likely to have mothers that said they were having problems managing the child; they were facing multiple stresses such as serious disagreements with their partner&mdash;the mother or the father&mdash;serious financial problems and serious housing problems; and they were less likely to be satisfied with their local area as a good place to bring up young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the report tabled by the Senate committee today described, on page 3, young people `who were slipping between the cracks of society . . . spending days and weeks watching TV, sleeping and withdrawing from society'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both in suburban and regional Australia, unemployment has become endemic in some areas. By the middle of 1994 there were 703,900 children aged between 0 and 14 years growing up in families where no parent was employed. The parents of more than half of those children, 448,200, were not in the labour force. Most were single parents, predominantly women, with caring responsibilities. In these areas, both in suburban and regional Australia, national programs must be tailored to the needs of those regions in order for them to have any chance of being effective. A program which will work in Tweed Heads may not necessarily work in Burnie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned training programs. Let us look at some of those training programs and their outcomes. One of the programs specifically targeted to indigenous people is the community development employment project. The evidence put to the committee suggests that opinion in the Aboriginal community is divided about the benefits of the scheme. One indigenous witness told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the CDEP&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is also a way of disguising unemployment figures in terms of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>That witness also contended that the CDEP failed to provide adequate training for future employment. The figures that I am about to quote relate to the status of clients about three months after program assistance had ended&mdash;that is, after they had been through a labour market training program. In regard to Aboriginal employment, 57.3 per cent were still unemployed three months after program assistance had ended; in jobtrain, 63.4 per cent were still unemployed; in job clubs, 59.4 per cent were still unemployed; in jobskills, 60.3 per cent were still unemployed; and, in the environmental program LEAP, 60.7 per cent were still unemployed. Even the most successful of these programs, jobstart, had a rate of 37.6 per cent unemployment three months after completion, so these programs simply are not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the numbers of those in what is called continuing program assistance, the figures are even more interesting. For those who are uninitiated in DEETspeak, continuing program assistance means that people are in another training program three months after finishing the first one. Of these people&mdash;that is, those who have gone on to the second training program&mdash;48.2 per cent reappear in the office of labour market assistance; 30.1 per cent reappear in jobtrain; 27.4 per cent reappear in Aboriginal employment; 29.8 per cent in job clubs; and 19.1 per cent in LEAP. This is a damning indictment of what the government chooses to call a successful program to look after the interests of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more cynical person than I would suggest that the plethora of training programs that are starting now&mdash;at the end of October 1995&mdash;are being used to remove people from unemployment lists in the lead-up to the election. The unemployment problem, it could be suggested, has been overtaken by the blatant desire of this government to be re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another criticism of Working Nation that my colleague Senator Tierney made is the fact that restricted access to labour market programs is, in itself, creating a class of long-term unemployed. Being a long-term unemployed is a barrier to obtaining employment, because employers are not so anxious to take those people on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the impact of this extended period of unemployment Australia has endured? Between 1976 and 1981 in the least affluent five per cent of neighbourhoods, average household incomes fell by over $7,000 in absolute terms, and the income gap between the top and bottom five per cent of neighbourhoods almost doubled to over $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent international study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation ranked Australia fourth behind Norway, New Zealand and Britain in the growth of inequality in the 13 years from 1979 to 1992. At the heart of this inequity has been the inadequate growth of jobs since the 1970s and this government's failure to adequately tackle the problem of unemployment. The government have often quoted their version of the social wage based on models created by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. I will quote from an article written recently by Petro Georgiou, my colleague in the other place. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These models allocate total State and Federal expenditure on health, education and housing to different household types, according to how much they are estimated to use government services. The models&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, those used by the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">indicate that the lowest income groups get the most benefit from the social wage. The problem with the NATSEM models is that they do not use actual incomes, but constructed hypothetical, equivalent incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>When the actual incomes people receive are used, Labor's claim that the social wage is progressive is a sham. On the basis of actual incomes, the lowest earning 40 per cent of households receive 35.5 per cent of the money spent on the social wage, and the top earning 40 per cent of households receive 46.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government calculates the real increase in the social wage since 1983 as $736 for every Australian. This of course comes nowhere near the $7,000 absolute decline in household incomes in the poorest five per cent of neighbourhoods. This government likes to talk about the $2.2 billion it spent on Working Nation but, when all this rhetoric is laid aside, the government cannot escape the fact that there are still over 763,100 people classified as unemployed; and the long-term unemployed make up over one-third of that total.</PARA>

We are indebted to their work for gifting us with wood products and for contributing to the life style we enjoy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past in Australia, through ignorance of the ecological complexity of our country, and through greed, we have already destroyed much of our natural inheritance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear to us that Australia's old growth forests are both ecologically precious and of great natural beauty. They also are home to rare and endangered species. As such, they mirror the creativity of God.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore to continue to log them, for whatever purpose, must be considered ethically and even morally wrong. The text of the Book of Genesis, often referred to by those seeking to justify such destruction [`be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion' (Gen 1:28)], does not grant to humans the right to exploit, let alone to destroy, God's creation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases, which was handed down today in the Senate. I will make a few comments in the few minutes available to me, and in the weeks ahead if that is possible. This is a very cautious report. It certainly follows some very narrow terms of reference, which we were given. Those terms of reference were negotiated very carefully, and it was important that they be agreed to by the parties. For that reason, I certainly supported those terms of reference and have agreed with this report to the need for it to be unanimous. We certainly achieved that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I underline that it is a cautious report. I will give a couple of examples. On one of the critical issues, which is the shredding of the Heiner documents in Queensland, the committee says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the benefit of hindsight, the Committee considers that the shredding of the Heiner documents may have been an exercise in poor judgment. Greater consideration ought to have been given to alternative approaches to resolving the problems associated with the inquiry. In particular, the Committee considers more heed should have been given to the `Crown as a model litigant' notion: it might have been more appropriate for the Queensland Government to have retained the documents for a certain period to allow for their production, if required, in legal action.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a criticism of the Queensland government&mdash;cautious, nevertheless a criticism. I wanted to press some stronger words than that on the committee. That was prompted by the findings and advice of Callinan QC, who, in a letter which has been released and published by the committee, quite clearly pointed out that sections 129 and 119 of the criminal justice code in Queensland clearly indicate that the shredding of documents in this kind of event may be a criminal act. Callinan made no judgment on that because obviously that would need to be tested in a court. But he does say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is evident from all of the above that the Criminal Justice Commission has not given serious attention to the implications of destroying documents knowingly in order to avoid or render more difficult litigation. They have ignored these serious matters. Arguably relevant provisions are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA>After quoting from the criminal code, he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again the Criminal Justice Commission's narrow/strict interpretation of `judicial proceeding' is too significant to ignore. There are now clear compelling reasons for these matters to be investigated comprehensively. Mr Barnes made findings of fact which were not based on all of the relevant documentation.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a lot more to that. I personally agree with Callinan's opinion and with the opinion of Neil Turner, a National Party MP from Queensland who was very critical of the CJC's performance, particularly in this matter. When I have more time, I will read into the record what he said in a dissenting report, because I believe that what he said is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the documentation presented to this committee was so critical. Although the Senate is not a court&mdash;we need to underline that&mdash;and it was unable to do very much beyond hearing the evidence and commenting upon it, all of the cases before us clearly require extensive and further investigation and arbitration. Perhaps the most critical document</PARA>
<PARA>ation are the submissions of Robert Butler. I believe that there has been an abuse of power by the CJC. I believe it needs to be far more accountable than it has been. Perhaps the way to obtain such accountability is for Queensland to have a Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contribution to the International Telecommunications Union in 1995/96 is estimated to be 4.950 million Swiss Francs. Based on an exchange rate at 3 April 1995 of $A0.8223 per Swiss Franc, the 1995/96 budget shows a contribution of $6.012 million. As at 3 July 1995 the contribution is $6.19 million. The exact sum to be paid will depend on the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the Swiss Franc, at the time of payment. The International Telecommunications Union's budget covers the activities of its Radiocommunication, Telecommunication Standardisation and Telecommunication Sectors.</PARA>
